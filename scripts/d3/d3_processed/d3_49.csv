"How does TCP/IP affect Hotmail ? All Internet traffic is TCP/IP ( Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ) . Everything you send to Hotmail , and everything they send back , is transported over TCP/IP.The same is true for any web site , Instant Messaging application , music download , etc.The rare exception is Voice over IP ( like Vonage ) which uses UDP/IP . It 's less reliable than TCP , but it 's a simpler protocol and works well for the zillions of tiny packets that make up a phone call .",1

Rational Corp. took the UML and developed a standardized process for implementing projects in a series of iterations based on its UML tools . IBM bought Rational and continued RUP development . IBM recently donated part of its RUP intellectual property to the open source community . See link in sources for more info.The second part of your question is a little harder . How RUP relates to project managment is that RUP is a process . It defines the steps to be taken to produce a product and it defines the deliverables to be produced at each phase . So , the relationship between RUP and project management is RUP defines the artifacts to be produced and PM strives to manage the cost and schedule associated with producing those artifacts .",1

"In websites/html , why do some links to images/files start with `` ./ '' ? e.g . < img src= '' ./images/foo.jpg '' > is it best to use ./ or just / or nothing or something else ? ( what does ./ mean and whats the purpose ) for the most part is should n't matter which you use . ./ , / , and nothing , all mean the same . If the first two are used , you are explicitly telling your webserver to look in the current directy of execution for whatever file . If no address is specified it defaults to look in the current directory . ../ means `` look in the parent directory '' so if our current directory is /usr/local ../ would take us to /usr . Ideally both of these switches are used for directory traversal . Commonly used in command line interactions ( linux & dos ) eg : ( DOS ) -- > cd ../",1

It is a free download , and will create a bootable OS Cd for Windows 2000 or XP.http : //www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/From the PE Builder Website : '' Bart 's PE Builder helps you build a `` BartPE '' ( Bart Preinstalled Environment ) bootable Windows CD-Rom or DVD from the original Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 installation/setup CD , very suitable for PC maintenance tasks.It will give you a complete Win32 environment with network support , a graphical user interface ( 800x600 ) and FAT/NTFS/CDFS filesystem support . Very handy for burn-in testing systems with no OS , rescuing files to a network share , virus scan and so on.This will replace any Dos bootdisk in no time !

"How does GMail work ? ? ? I mean..see all the time u r on Gmail u just mail.google.com/mail on ur address bar ... .It just loads into the same web page ... .How is that done ... ? ? GMail uses AJAX . It 's the new buzz term.AJAX is an architecture and not a technology . AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.Instead of doing a normal POST/GET to the Webserver , AJAX uses an JavaScript Object called XMLHttpRequest . The Javascript will call this object and XMLHttpRequest will inturn do the POST/GET to the WebServer . This way we do not need to refresh the entire page just to update on a part of the web page.Here is a tutorial demonstrating how it is being used in a specific scenerio : http : //www.javarss.com/ajax/j2ee-ajax.html",1

"Will an AGP8x graphics card work on a AGP4x slot ? I 'm interested in buying a graphics card for my PC . This card ( GeForce 6500A ) is labeled `` AGP 8x '' , but the AGP slot on my motherboard is 1x , 2x and 4x compatible.Is there a backward compatibility between 8x and 4x ? I just found this website ( http : //www.ertyu.org/~steven_nikkel/agpcompatibility.html ) giving explanations on voltage , but no real answer.Thanks . Sorry to say it wo n't . There are some cards that say 8x/4x compatibility , it will work in both , but if the card is only labeled as 8x , it will probably cause problems in a 4x slots , if it will work at all.The opposite can usually be done . If you have an 8x slot , a 4x will most often work just fine . However , if you have an 8x card , it requires a minimum of an 8x slot.The backwards compatibility in this case is higher slot to lower card , not the reverse .",1

"sbc offers different price rates for dsl . what is the best if my son will be playing x box live ? is there different speeds with different pricing ? with what we have now he 's playing people that have cable dsl and he keeps getting booted off Xbox Live is just like any online game . The biggest issue you will ever see has to do with Latency , also known as `` Lag '' . Latency occurs when there are bottlenecks in the general network layout . Think LA freeways at 5pm on a Friday night . Unfortunately this issue is not one you can change , because it has to do with the actual design of the network , so choosing your provider properly is essential.Cable Internet , in its basic form , is a shared medium . This means that every person who subscribes to Cable in your neighborhood shares the same on-ramp to the internet . This is only a problem if there are large numbers of concurrent users in your area.DSL , on the other hand , connects you to the backbone in a more efficient , seperated manner . This has the advantage of being much less susceptible to latency . Unfortunately , this advantage goes down the farther away from the switching office ( CO ) you are . Another thing to consider is newer Cable networks tend to use a different model of communications than the old ones , and so approach DSL levels of service.To sum up : DSL is better than Cable , but tends to be slower . However any speed higher than about 1 meg / sec should be MORE than sufficient to run today 's games .",1

"Who invented the `` modem '' and when ? Tomlinson invented email in 1972.Digital modems developed from the need to transmit data for North American air defense during the 1950s . Modems were used to communicate data over the public switched telephone network or PSTN . Analog telephone circuits can only transmit signals that are within the frequency range of voice communication . A modem sends and recieves data between two computers . Modem stands for modulate/demodulate.In 1962 , the first commercial modem was manufactured - the Bell 103 by AT & T . The Bell 103 was also the first modem with full-duplex transmission , frequency-shift keying or FSK , and had a speed of 300 bits per second or 300 bauds.The 56K modem was invented by Dr. Brent Townshend in 1996.History of ModemsRobert Lucky invented the automatic adaptive equalizer in 1965 at Bell Laboratories.The Man behind the ModemsBrent Townshend , the man who dreamed up the idea for 56K bit/sec modems.Developer receives patent for PCM modemsBrent Townshend , the Quebec-based developer who worked on several core concepts for pulse-code modulated ( PCM ) modems , received several U.S. patents for that technology .",1

If it has a network/Ethernet connection , a router or hub or switch ( depending on your network setup ) would be the easiest - if you have one of those three already , you would connect the printers network cable to the router or hub or switch and then should be able to set it up on both computers through Windows printer sharing .

"Which is better , AMD or Intel ? I know for a fact that AMD is much better than Intel ! AMD 's processors run a lot faster and cooler . A cooler running processor is important . Not only does it mean that AMD processors have a faster clock speed than comparable Intel products but AMDs also have a longer life expectancy as well . Plus AMD costs quite a bit less than their Intel counterparts . AMD is also ahead on the technology curve as well . They were the first company to introduce the 64-bit PC processor many months ahead of Intel ’ s 64-bit processor . This is why I believe that AMD will possibly out live Intel.I 've had both brands and nobody can even come close AMD ’ s speed and power ! I am running a newer AMD Sempron 3000+ with 512 MB of memory and Windows 2000 Professional SP4 for my operating system and this combination works great.From now on AMD , is the only processor for me .

"What is the best music creation software to use for a windows xp computer ? I want a computer program that lets me make new songs by adding beats and sounds and lets me make remixes to songs from my library on my computer . It depends on how much you want to program your own sounds verus leveraging pre-canned loops and samples culled from the songs you want to remix.I 'm still a big fan of Acid -- - Orignally from Sonic Foundry but now a product offered by Sony Music : http : //www.sonymediasoftware.com/products/acidfamily.aspAcid is excellent for working with loops -- it allows you to easily time-stretch loops and transpose them to work well with other loops culled from other sources . A lot of what makes people love Garageband ( Apple 's entry-level music software ) was first pioneered in Acid . The main limitation of Acid is that it has limited or no support for the creation of your own original sounds and sequences -- it 's more of a loop arranger.Another outstanding application is Propellerheads Reason 3.0 ( http : //www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/ ) Reaon gives you an entire virtual rack of synthesizers , samplers , and effects that you can intuitively connect with virtual patch cables . Every knob is designed to be twiddled in real time and the best thing is that all these modifications can be recorded for playback or fine-tuning.Finally , a third application you might want to check out is Ableton Live ( http : //www.ableton.com/index.php ? main=live ) Live is extremely popular among performing musicians today because it is optimized for live performance or on-the-fly creation/arranging of songs . The application is a bit like Acid in that it is mainly intended for working with building blocks of pre-created loops ( either instrument loops or sampled material ) with an interface and workflow that makes it very easy to add , subtract , and tweak stuff as the rest of the song plays back . Between the 3 applications I 'm sure you 'll find something that work for you . Best of all , you can download free trial versions of all applications to see for yourself . Happy remixing !",1

Comcast high speed will run you about $ 42 per month if you are a cable subscriber , it 's more if you are n't . SBC Yahoo is $ 15 per month and is comparable to Verizon DSL . You can either spend $ 42 per month for 8Mbps or $ 15 per month for much slower DSL at 768kpbs . If you are going to just browse the web and download files then DSL should be fine .

"What is the best AMD64 CPU for multitasker/gamer ? among athlon , athlon x2 , opteron , opteron x2 . price range 400 and under . I highly recommend the Athlon 64 X2 3800+ dual core processor if you are thinking of multitasking . Each core is based pretty much on the Venice core , and has 512 KB L2 cache . Each core runs at 2.0GHz , which is the same speed as the 90 nanometer process Athlon 64 3200+.For about the same price , the best single core processor is the Athlon 64 4000+ , with the San Diego core . It has 1MB of L2 cache . This is likely a better gaming processor than the X2 3800+ , because it has has a 400MHz speed advantage in one thread . It also has a 1MB L2 cache.Currently , all mainstream games are single threaded , meaning that they ca n't utilize the capabilities that dual core processors have . The dual core processor will perform very nicely in the environment of your operating system , but it wo n't have an advantage in gaming . Most people predict that multi-threaded PC games will become more common in the next few years , but there is a good chance they will do nicely on older single threaded systems at lower speeds.When it comes to games , your graphics card is far more important than the speed of your processor . Normal multitasking benefits most from the processor.Overall , I would recommend the Athlon 64 X2 3800+ .",1

"how to computer work ? Here 's the simple version : Computers haveA brain ( CPU or central processing unit ) Memory StoragePeripheralsThe CPU is like an air traffic controller controlling all your requests and running all your programs.The Memory holds the programs - including your OS ( windows etc . ) and data temporarily for the CPU to access.Storage such as a hard disk drive holds information when it is too large or inconvenient to place in memory and when the computer is shut down.Peripherals : Keyboard , mouse , monitor , printer are what the computer uses to interact with the Human.The CPU manages all your interactions : running programs , copying files , surfing the web . It uses the resources it needs ( peripherals , memory , storage etc . ) to fulfill those requests . Imagine you have a private chef , who is locked in his own kitchen . You make a request to him . He produces the food and uses his resources , pots , pans ingredients , recipes etc . He 's like your CPU.It goes much further than that , but I hope that helps .",1

"Can I import/export programs & files from one computer to another without a network and without burning them ? Want to put my windows xp from one tower onto another tower that only has 98 version plus tranfer other programs and files to the new tower but not sure how to go about it without it being networked . Any help would be greatly appreciated . : - ) From my understanding , it sounds like you want to `` copy '' you install of windows XP onto another computer . This will not work for a few reasons . 1 ) The current WinXP installation is configured for the machine its on right now . If you transfer exactly that windows install it will not load . ( without some major hacks ) 2 ) It 's technically illegal to install one copy of windows xp on two machines.But on the other hand to transfer information between the two machines , the easiest solution is to pull the Hard drive from the 98 machine and stick it in the XP machine . XP will recognize this new drive and make it a local drive ( E , or some other letter ) . From that point you can tranfer information to and from it like any other storage device .",1

When you have installed and uninstalled a lot of programs those programs sometimes leaving entries in the registry behind .

Consider .99 cents ; it will generally bump up the total number of bids , but will also cost you less to list the auction !

I try to start most auctions on Sunday night at 6 PM Pacific time ( eBay 's default time is Pacific time ) . However , most of what I sell is bought by people here in the states -- if you have more international buyers , then a different time might work better for you.Hope this helps !",1

"Why would Java advocates support Unix ?

"can sata and pata raid work at the same time , so in `` my computer '' all the drives show up as a single space ? If you mean , can you combine both SATA and PATA drives in a single RAID , then the answer is yes , but not a hardware RAID.There are two kinds of RAID -- hardware and software . Hardware RAID is implemented by a hardware RAID controller , which is either part of your motherboard , or an add-in card . Software RAID is implemented by the operating system . Software RAID is slower than hardware RAID , but if you have a reasonably fast processor , it 's not using terribly much slower . If you have a slow processor , it will be slower , and more importantly , it will put a big load on your processor and make everything run slowly.To the best of my knowledge , there are no RAID controllers that will RAID an SATA drive with a PATA drive , but you can set up whatever RAID you want with software RAID . If you already have your drives in hardware RAID ( and intend to keep them that way ) then when you do this , you will be RAIDing the already-existing hardware RAIDs , since a hardware RAID is treated as a single drive on the `` software level '' .Here 's some info on software RAID in Windows : http : //www.techimo.com/articles/index.pl ? photo=149Here 's some info on software RAID in GNU/Linux : http : //www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.htmlHere 's some info on software RAID in Mac OS X : http : //www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/softraid3.htmlYou can find abundant info on doing software RAID on these and other operating systems by entering `` software RAID '' together with name of the operating system in a search engine .",1

This disrepency is why programs that copy movie DVDs need to compress the DVD content after unencrypting it before they can be burned to a normal DVD . Recently new DVD burners and media were introduced that allowed people to burn DVD-9 DVDs reasonably affordably.So a double-layer DVD burner is one that is capable of burning 8.5 gigabyte DVD-9 format DVDs.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd # Technical_information,1
"how can add 2 harddrives to my computer ? Each IDE channel can accept 2 devices . Most motherboards come with 2 IDEs . So 4 devices . Your CD/DVD drive will also be plugged into this . So , if there are no other IDE devices plugged in you can install 2 more hard disks . Each channel should have a Master and Slave . These are controlled by small jumpers on the back of the devices . This has to be done correctly.Some motherboards also have SATA connections if these are not used then you can use SATA hard disks.If you dont want to open up the computer and fiddle about with cables and jumpers , then get external hard disks with USB and can be plugged in to the USB socket in your computer . Much easier.Good LuckBattery Wizard",1

"How to put in color ink from an ink installation kit ? I have a Lexmark Z611 printer and I have an emty ink cartridge but I have this kit were I can put more ink into it but I do n't know exactly were to drill the holes to put in some more color ink . Can someone help me ? Your cartridge needs to have the top popped in order to refill . HOWEVER , make sure the cartridge has not been run empty , or it will not respond to refilling . Also if you have removed the cartridge and it is just sitting on your desk , then it will not respond either . The printhead needs to be kept damp , or protected . The last thing you need to know is that you MUST have lexmark 10n0026 ink . If you bought one of the universal kits , you may be stuck with ink that is too thin and will leak , or ink that is too thick and will clog.Once you determine that all is OK , simply use a knife to pry off the top of the cartridge , and if you can not tell which color goes where , use a tooth pick to determine which color is where . these are small cartridges and will not require much ink , so fill very slowly . Watch the printhead and the top of the cartridge at the same time . At the first sign of ink coming from the print head - STOP and pull back a bit on the needle ( a very little bit ) . You should also watch the top of the cartridge , as to avoid having the ink pour out of the top . Repeat for all colors . Hope this helps.If you have to remove the cartridge prior to refilling , then you should place it in a zipper bag along with a slightly damp paper towel , until you can get to it . It must remain moist , but not wet , and do not store in the freezer .",1

"What is a blog ? I have head this word a lot of times but did not understand it . what does it mean ? A blog is a website for which an individual or a group frequently generates text , photographs , video or audio files , and/or links , typically ( but not always ) on a daily basis . The term is a shortened form of weblog . Authoring a blog , maintaining a blog or adding an article to an existing blog is called `` blogging '' . Individual articles on a blog are called `` blog posts , '' `` posts , '' or `` entries '' . The person who posts these entries is called a `` blogger '' . * Electronic communities existed before internetworking . For example the AP wire was , in effect , similar to a large chat room with `` wire fights '' and electronic conversations . Another pre-digital electronic community , amateur ( or `` ham '' ) radio , allowed individuals who set up their own broadcast equipment to communicate with others directly . Ham radio also had logs called `` glogs '' that were personal diaries made using wearable computers in the early 1980s . * Before blogging became popular , digital communities took many forms , including Usenet , e-mail lists and bulletin boards . In the 1990s Internet forum software , such as WebX , created running conversations with `` threads . '' Threads are topical connections between messages on a electronic `` corkboard . '' See `` Common terms , '' below . * Diarists kept journals on the Web : most called themselves online diarists , journalists , journallers , or journalers . A few called themselves escribitionists . The Open Pages webring contained members of the online-journal community . The first famous journaller was probably Justin Hall . * Other forms of journals kept online also existed . A notable example was game programmer John Carmack 's widely read journal , published via the finger protocol . * Websites , including both corporate sites and personal homepages , had and still often have `` What 's New '' or `` News '' sections , often on the index page and sorted by date .",1

Hi ! what class out of mage and rogue do you think is the best ? i personally like rogue best , but lately i tried the mage , and it was kick butt . what do you think ? and what race ( and profession ) is the best for that class ? Both are played alot , and both do great damage . But I think later on it would be better to do Mage instead Rogue . A Mage will have an easier time finding a party for things like instances such as UBRS , LBRS , MC , ect . Human would be a good race because of the extra reputation they gain.. As far as profession , Enchanting is always good because either you can make gold off the enchanting supplies or enchanting other 's items or your own . Cloth working is another great profession beings you would wear cloth and you will be able to make yourself some awsome robes , ect later on . Mages are `` wtfpwn '' or so they say , also alot of fun ... I have alot of lvl 60 's on the Silvermoon server and Mage was always a fun class of mine , hardly anyone could beat me , as on my other alts I was hardly ever able to beat a Mage . If you ever go onto the Silvermoon server , I am always either on Druidess ( Druid ) on Alliance side or Kelpie ( Rogue ) on the Horde side . I 'm always willing to help . Just pick whatever you enjoy playing the most . All of them are fun in their own way.. and if you like to solo alot you would have an easier time on Rogue but later on when you want your class sets you would have an easier time as Mage to get them .",1

"Can i use more than 1 anti-virus software in my PC ? How ? I want to install an anti-virus software ( panda ) , but i 'm told to uninstall my old program ( symantic ) .Can i install it without remove my old program ? I assume you 're using Windows . Using two anti-virus programs creates conflicts . For instance when you download a file both will try to scan it at the same time . The second program will cause an error because the file is already in use by the first program.One top of that Windows now requires each anti-virus program to register with it so it can monitor weather it 's enable or disabled . When there is two windows gets confused . Plus it uses up system resources . Just run on anti-virus application ; keep it updated , run regular scans .

Having a fast processor helps , but to play games like half life 2 you would probably still need to buy a separate graphics card .

"what is ocx ? Short for OLE Control Extension , an independent program module that can be accessed by other programs in a Windows environment . OCX controls end with a .ocx extension . OCX controls represent Microsoft 's second generation of control architecture , the first being VBX controls written in Visual Basic . A component software technology from Microsoft that enables a Windows program to add functionality by calling ready-made components . Generally called `` OLE controls '' or `` OLE custom controls , '' they appear to the end user as just another part of the program.OCXs are Microsoft 's second-generation component architecture . Unlike first-generation 16-bit Visual Basic controls ( VBXs ) , which were only written in Visual Basic , OCXs can be written in several languages and come in 16-bit and 32-bit versions . OCXs were renamed ActiveX controls and continue to use the .OCX file extension . Both VBX and OCX controls have now been superseded by ActiveX controls . However , ActiveX is backward compatible with OCX controls , which means that ActiveX containers , such as Microsoft 's Internet Explorer , can execute OCX components .",1

"Would an autoresponder for my domain email trigger a listing in CBL databases in response to spam received ?

I wonder if this would be caused by my autoresponders to the postmaster @ domain.com address , which , when replying to spam emails with false addresses , might be causing the server receiving my reply to think that my auto-response is spam . If you 're sending mail to the postmasters of domains forged into spam headers , it 's entirely possible you 're hitting some address that feeds the CBL .

"How do you configure a tunnel ? I want to create a secure tunnel between two sites . They both have internet access and fixed IP adresses . What hardware and configuration do I need ? Thanks for your help Hey ! Great question ... What you are referring to is a VPN . Typically a VPN consists of a minimum of 2 pieces of hardware , configured to accept each other 's incoming traffic and ( un ) encrypt that traffic . If you do NOT already have a firewall on both ends now is the time to get them ! A good firewall will provide adequate , secure VPN services as well as NAT/PAT/etc.There are so many brands and feature sets I wo n't recommend a particular one . However , the first things you need to do are:1 ) Become familiar with what a VPN does exactly ( look at Cisco 's site for a really good primer ) 2 ) Decide what you want to do with the VPN . If you are looking at just accessing e-mail or simple file transfers that 's great . But if you want to get into running applications ( such as accessing an Access MDB ) over the VPN I think you will be quite disappointed . This is , of course , all dependent on your connection speed.3 ) Research some hardware by looking at both Professional and User reviews ( but remember to take them with a grain of salt ) ( Check out CNET.COM for hardware reviews ) . Be sure to pay particular attention to the type of encryptions it is capable of using . If you can , get 3DES encryption as it is the current industry standard and is relatively quick so it wo n't impact performance.4 ) Determine your budget for both ends , and do n't forget to include installation costs if necessary for the other end from where you are ( if you ca n't get there easily ) Also , if you have dedicated Internet connections ( such as Frame Relay or other type of T-1 ) you can call your ISP and ask if they sell a firewall/VPN package that works with your current connection.I just got through setting up a new VPN for my business so I could work from home , and with a T-1 circuit it 's pretty slow . So we use a Remote Control package on dedicated PC 's to do most of the work . This way only screen shots , keyboard and mouse controls are being passed . Not only is it blazing fast , but the remote control software adds an additional layer of encryption to the data being passed . Nothing like encrypting your data 5 seperate times for security ! Good look , and welxome to the world of VPN 's !",1

"how does computer work ? A computer is an information-processing machine that works by converting all kinds of information into binary numbers ( ones and zeros ) and then using simple mathematics to make decisions about , or to rearrange , those numbers . There are two things essential to understanding the basics of how a computer works . One is that a computer treats any type of information ( not only numbers but also letters , words , dates , and so on ) as if it consisted simply of binary ones and zeros . For example , a computer can translate the letter “ A ” typed into its keyboard into a string of ones and zeros , such as 1000001 . One reason to do this is that once in binary form , the information can be stored and moved about more easily .",1

I assure you , this is a false sense of security . Do not trust the hardware or software to do the whole job for you.I believe the primary reason why computers get a virus is a lack of common sense . To wit ... - Be skeptical of anything you receive in e-mail that was not solicited , especially if it has an attachment.- Think twice before downloading that freeware.- Avoid Kazaa and the like.- Do review website certificates to satisfy yourself that the site you 're heading for is really the site you wanted to go to.- Make sure you download and install every security patch your OS vendor provides . You should manually review your vendor at least weekly ... even if you have an automatic update feature.A few minutes spent on satisfying yourself that you 've done everything you can do will provide you with peace of mind .",1

"Should my router and modem be the same model ( Linksys ) to function at top capability ? I have an SBC modem and ( wired ) Linksys router . I have tried to connect my laptop to my network , but the router does not seem to configure while using the modem . When I plug the laptop into the SBC modem directly , everything works well . Any help on this is appreciated . Thanks . Well , it depends on the router and how your IP address is assigned but it sounds like to me you are going to have to go into your routers configuration and either tell it to detect the DHCP settings and your IP address automatically or you will have to specify it manually . My experience in this matter ( I have set up four DSL and two cable installations ) is that it should be assigned automatically if the router is n't detecting those ( i.e . the process of detecting it fails ) then the router is probably defective , I had that happen to a Netgear router , it would n't detect either one , I exchanged it for another one and the new one worked perfectly . So if auto detection does n't work , it 's probably the router.For more instructions select your model from the link below and see the user manual .",1

"How do I install memory into my computer ? My computer savvy friend left me hanging w/ RAM she ordered for me via Ebay and no instructions.Have Gateway system bought secondhand . PLEASE , help me ! Installing Memory:1 . Open the case . You can leave all of the plugs in place and components attached.2 . Get grounded . Before touching the new memory or anything inside the computer , you need to get grounded . The easiest way to be sure that you are grounded is to use an inexpensive antistatic wrist strap that can be purchased at a local electronics or computer store . If you don ’ t have a wrist strap , touch the inside of the chassis while the PC is still plugged in ; this will ground you . Once you are grounded , unplug the computer from the wall.3 . Find the place to insert the module . Look for other memory like the memory you have just purchased . You will see empty slots next to the memory that is already in place.4 . Pick up the memory module by the side edges . Don ’ t touch the flat surfaces or the contacts along the bottom . Orient the memory to match the memory that is already installed . Insert the memory module in the first empty slot next to the currently installed memory . Different types of memory install slightly differently.a . DIMMs and most newer types of memory are simply inserted into the slot with a gentle downward pressure . The clips on both sides of the module must snap into place for the module to be properly seated.b . SIMMs are a slightly older type of memory found in most computers more than three years old . They are inserted at a 45-degree angle and then rotated to a vertical position . Again , the supporting clips will snap into place.5 . Replace the cover , plug in the computer , and turn it on . In some computers , you will see the amount of RAM scroll by , confirming that the computer has recognized the new memory . If the memory has not been installed properly , there may be error messages , or the computer may freeze . If anything seems abnormal , remove and reinstall the new memory . Once everything is running properly , you can hold down the ALT key while double-clicking on My Computer to see the System Properties screen which will confirm the amount of memory that your computer thinks is installed .",1

"how can I make my Linksys router encryption work with SBC DSL ? The only way it works now is w/o encryption. ? I 've tried using Linksys ' 64-bit and 128-bit encryption for its wireless router . When I try to use them , I lose my SBC Global DSL connection to the internet . You internet connection is n't going down but only the ability of your wireless devices to access the internet . Once you enable encryption on your router you then need to configure you laptop/pc 's wireless connection to match the ssid and wep key . Once that is done then your connection should work just fine . Wep is n't the best security but it is a start . If you are going to use it then I would use 128bit and disable broadcast ssid . As for configuring your laptop/pc it depends on if you are using an application or depending on windows to control the wireless card . An external card could be using an application . If it is an internal built in card then more than likely it is being controlled by windows . You can go to your network connections and verify .

Can someone tell me when Google Earth update the Images ? Images on of my City Chandigarh are Six months old . Google gets its imagery from several different sources . It is my understanding that they buy the imagery from private companies such as DigitalGlobe and EarthSat/MDA . It is my understanding that they are able to get this imagery at a greater bargain since they do n't necessarily request high resolution of specific areas . Rather they just take the imagery that these company 's other clients have already requested and had tasked . As such Google rolls new imagery as it becomes more easily available from the companies . That is why areas outside of the US have less high resolution imagery -- because there are not other client requesting and paying for that information to be collected .,1

"msn email registration in outlook xpress ? hi , i have an msn email address rg. , < username > @ msn.com . how can i register it in outlook express ? i have win xp prof system . with sp2.pls help.tnx Setting Up Mail Servers in Outlook ExpressSometimes simple questions are maddeningly difficult to answer . A recurring example is the apparently simple `` How do I set up my mail server in Outlook Express ? '' The easy answer is simplicity itself : Click Tools , click Accounts , click Add , click Mail , and then just follow the wizard . The wizard asks for your name ( easy ) , your e-mail address ( also usually easy ) , and then asks you to set up your mail server . It is here that the easy answer all too often fails since many users , especially new ones , not only do n't know the names and type of their mail servers , but also often do n't know what a mail server is.http : //www.microsoft.com/windows/IE/community/columns/mailserver.mspx",1
"How do you make a USB drive bootable ? I have a Sony Micro Vault 256MB HDD ( the stick kind that plugs into the USB port ) I want to make this bootable so I can use it to dump pre-built images using ghost . I need to know how to get it to format with the system info so I can boot directly from the device . Your BIOS must support booting from USB devices . On system startup you need to get into your BIOS ( usually F2 - check manufacturer 's specification ) , and find where you can specify the boot order . Select a low-numbered boot order item , and set it to USB-HDD ( if availble , otherwise another USB option ) . This may require several attempts until the right device option is found.Since most USB drives are ATAPI-compliant , your BIOS should detect it as if it were an external USB hard drive.Just make sure you specify a boot order BEFORE your internal hard drive ( usually HDD , or IDE0 ) , otherwise your system will always boot to the hard drive.Also , you need to format the USB drive as a bootable drive . If you can get the system to boot from a DOS , Windows or Linux floppy disk , you can try installing DOS , Windows 95/98 , or Linux ( Win2000 , and WinXP require more than 256Mb for sytem files ) . Your system will likely assign the USB drive as the C : & # 92 ; drive ( MAKE SURE THIS IS THE CASE BEFORE FORMATTING ! ! ! ) .Keep in mind that most USB drives are slower than hard drives , so performance may not be up to par . The newer `` high-speed '' drives are faster , but not comparable to a real hard drive.If no options work , your Micro Valut may not be ATAPI-compliant , or it 's USB-HDD firmware may not be compatible with your system . I had this happen with a SanDisk Cruzer mini , but a PNY Attache worked.If I may make one suggestion as well ... make a bootable CD with your images instead . CD 's are much more rugged , and can not be accidentally erased . Duplicates are EXTREMELY cheaper ( about 5 cents vs. $ 20 ) than the USB drive solution . Many more BIOS ' support booting from CD ( for about 10 years now ) , so compatibility is usually not an issue . All of the commercial CD-burning packages ( including most of the LITE versions ) support making bootable CD 's . The only trick is to make a bootable floppy that it can use to create the boot image on the CD .",1

If you have Windows Home then it may not show . Disk Mangament requires that you convert the disc volume to a dynamic disc , as well.What you -need- to do is learn how-to FDISK ( search on google for a tutorial ) , a DOS ( disk operating system ) command . You can access the command prompt via : Start -- > Accessories -- > Command Prompt . You will need to create two primary paritions/volumes ( the term is interchangeable ) . You will need to install linux on the first parition and Windows on the second . The FDISK command will also let you choose which parition is to be set to active .

"Computer keeps shutting down on it 's own ! What do I do ? It starts up normally then anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours later , all windows close and it says Windows is now shutting down . I have run a virus scan and found nothing . I have also deleted some programs I never use anymore & have tried to defrag but it shuts itself down before the defrag can be completed . Is there anything else i can do , or am i screwed ? If the computer shuts down a short while after trying to connect to the internet then it is probably a virus . To verify that , close your internet connection and leave your computer open . If the problem persists despite having closed your internet connection then it could mean a hardware problem . Use one of the freeware internet programs to monitor your computer 's temperature . If all appears normal there , it might be another virus ( check for abnormal processes or cpu usage at your process manager ) or a recently installed DDR chip that does not quite agree with your computer or a software installation that did not complete quite succesfully . If none of the above is the case I should advise going to the hardware store from which you bought the computer and ask some professional advice",1

"Which is the fastest computer in the world ? Well , there are three perspectives to your question , which are as follows : ( 1 ) A super computer ( 2 ) A desktop computer ( 3 ) Anything in a general sense that can compute.For the third perspective , The fastest computer in the world is much faster than the desktop in front of you , and it is sitting right on top of your shoulders ! The human brain is an amazing computing device and the fastest processor available right now . In supercomputers , the BlueGene/L - eServer Blue Gene Solution stationed at DOE/NNSA/LLNL at Livermore in California is ruling the world . It has , hold on your breath , 131072 processors , each processor with an individual performance of 2.8 GigaFlops ( PowerPC 440 700 MHz ) . It has a main memory of 32768 GB and is 3 times more powerful in processing than its immediate competitor ( Also by IBM ) . Surprisingly , its still in expansion phase . Blue Gene is an IBM Research project dedicated to exploring the frontiers in supercomputing : in computer architecture , in the software required to program and control massively parallel systems , and in the use of computation to advance our understanding of important biological processes such as protein folding.As for the fastest desktop configuration , it keeps changing every now and then . An interesting fact to note , Intel had come up with 4GHz chip , but could not commercialize it because of the excessive heating which could damage the chip . Hope to see such a chip soon . As on 6th January 2006 , Xi MTower 64 AGE-SLI is considered to be the fastest desktop Computer . Equipped with a 2.4-GHz Athlon 64 X2 4800+ CPU , 2GB of DDR400 SDRAM , a single EVGA E-GeForce 6800 Ultra graphics card , and two 300GB hard drives striped in a RAID 0 array , The $ 3897 gaming and graphics system justifies its high price with lots of speed and excellent expandability .

"How do I start the new Beta Yahoo Email ? This is what I found about Yahoo ! Mail Beta.====================================================Click on the below link to see how the Yahoo ! Email Beta looks like : http : //jeremy.zawodny.com/i/candygram-search.pngI 'm surprised that people are still emailing me to ask `` when are you gon na write something about the new Yahoo ! Mail ? `` I figured that with Walt Mossberg saying : I 've been comparing the new version of Yahoo Mail , which claims to be the leader in Web mail , with Gmail , the challenger Yahoo most fears . My verdict : The new Yahoo Mail is far superior to Gmail . Yahoo more closely matches the desktop experience most serious email users have come to expect ... .and PC Magazine saying : ... there 's no question that Yahoo ! is set to make a big leap forward with its new Web-based mail product . We 'll hold off on a rating until the official release or at least the full public beta , but from what we 've seen and tested so far , Yahoo ! 's competition may soon have some serious catching up to do ... .and the AP saying : Overall , I find Yahoo easier to use , and it 's quite impressive for a product that 's only weeks old . I expect even more features by the time a final version is released.Well , I figured that the cat was pretty well out of the bag : the new Yahoo ! Mail kicks a lot of ass . For lots of people out there , it 's going to be the first web-based replacement for Outlook or Outlook express they 've ever seen.And it 's got some serious `` WOW '' factor going for it . I still remember when Ethan turned on my access a few months ago . I was at home packing for my trip to Parowan when he gave me the URL . The interface loaded up and I just thought ... wow ! It was slower back then and has some bugs but it was already clear that it was going to move expectations up a level or two.Oh , and if you look at that screenshot , you 'll see that there are over 42,000 messages in my inbox . The product still works well with a big volume of mail.Now stop asking when I 'm gon na write about it ! : - ) BTW , It is a closed beta right now but that should change soon . In the meantime I 've asked the Yahoo ! Mail team if I could give out a few `` invites '' so faithful readers could try it out . No response yet , so no promises .

"what is the differece between a 5 port router and a 5 port switch ? First you need to know th differnce . To understand the difference between a router and a switch you need to understand the ISO model.ISO/OSI Network ModelThe standard model for networking protocols and distributed applications is the International Standard Organization 's Open System Interconnect ( ISO/OSI ) model . It defines seven network layers . Layer 1 - Physical Physical layer defines the cable or physical medium itself , e.g. , thinnet , thicknet , unshielded twisted pairs ( UTP ) . All media are functionally equivalent . The main difference is in convenience and cost of installation and maintenance . Converters from one media to another operate at this level . Layer 2 - Data Link Data Link layer defines the format of data on the network . A network data frame , aka packet , includes checksum , source and destination address , and data . The largest packet that can be sent through a data link layer defines the Maximum Transmission Unit ( MTU ) . The data link layer handles the physical and logical connections to the packet 's destination , using a network interface . A host connected to an Ethernet would have an Ethernet interface to handle connections to the outside world , and a loopback interface to send packets to itself . Ethernet addresses a host using a unique , 48-bit address called its Ethernet address or Media Access Control ( MAC ) address . MAC addresses are usually represented as six colon-separated pairs of hex digits , e.g. , 8:0:20:11 : ac:85 . This number is unique and is associated with a particular Ethernet device . Hosts with multiple network interfaces should use the same MAC address on each . The data link layer 's protocol-specific header specifies the MAC address of the packet 's source and destination . When a packet is sent to all hosts ( broadcast ) , a special MAC address ( ff : ff : ff : ff : ff : ff ) is used . Layer 3 - Network NFS uses Internetwork Protocol ( IP ) as its network layer interface . IP is responsible for routing , directing datagrams from one network to another . The network layer may have to break large datagrams , larger than MTU , into smaller packets and host receiving the packet will have to reassemble the fragmented datagram . The Internetwork Protocol identifies each host with a 32-bit IP address . IP addresses are written as four dot-separated decimal numbers between 0 and 255 , e.g. , 129.79.16.40 . The leading 1-3 bytes of the IP identify the network and the remaining bytes identifies the host on that network . The network portion of the IP is assigned by InterNIC Registration Services , under the contract to the National Science Foundation , and the host portion of the IP is assigned by the local network administrators , locally by noc @ indiana.edu . For large sites , usually subnetted like ours , the first two bytes represents the network portion of the IP , and the third and fourth bytes identify the subnet and host respectively . Even though IP packets are addressed using IP addresses , hardware addresses must be used to actually transport data from one host to another . The Address Resolution Protocol ( ARP ) is used to map the IP address to it hardware address . Layer 4 - Transport Transport layer subdivides user-buffer into network-buffer sized datagrams and enforces desired transmission control . Two transport protocols , Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) and User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) , sits at the transport layer . Reliability and speed are the primary difference between these two protocols . TCP establishes connections between two hosts on the network through 'sockets ' which are determined by the IP address and port number . TCP keeps track of the packet delivery order and the packets that must be resent . Maintaining this information for each connection makes TCP a stateful protocol . UDP on the other hand provides a low overhead transmission service , but with less error checking . NFS is built on top of UDP because of its speed and statelessness . Statelessness simplifies the crash",1

Sometimes , it takes a lucky accident , or a fresh way of looking at a problem , to discover a better , more robust or more elegant way to solve a specific problem . So , certainly , if I had to do these designs again today , I would probably do many things differently . I just hope that , almost three years down the line , people wo n't start dissecting my submitted CSS and start laughing at some of the naïve blunders that are hidden in there .",1

Microsoft Antispyware is pretty darn good and it removes about 99 % of spyware from a Windows PC ( ensure it is updated regularly though ) .Adaware & Spybot S & D are very good as well if Microsoft Antispyware does not find anything.I would STRONGLY advise you install Anti-Virus software as well like AVG it 's the best free Anti-Virus right now.You can not really get round the Anti-virus slowdown problem as they work by scanning each file once they are run to ensure a virus is not launched and infected into your system.If you want virus free computing use linux : ) I use OpenSUSE , it 's really good !

"how could i install program to other drive ? It depends on the program.Most professional programs will allow you to choose between a CUSTOM INSTALL and an Express Install . If so , choose CUSTOM INSTALL . This will allow you to choose program features to install and , usually , the installation folder . For the installation folder , there will usually be a BROWSE button . Click on that and select the drive and folder for the installation.If there is n't a CUSTOM INSTALL choice , you still might be presented with a default folder and a BROWSE button . Click on the BROWSE button and select the drive and folder you want to use.NOTE : Most programs allow you to type in your own folder name , even if it does n't already exist . These programs will usually tell you the folder does n't exist and ask your permission to create the folder . Click YES or OK to create the folder.I highly suggest that you keep a well-organized naming scheme throughout your use of the computer.EXAMPLE : I have a C : & # 92 ; Program Files & # 92 ; under which I have a lot of program folders . I also have a D : & # 92 ; Program Files & # 92 ; with program folders under that ( this is where I put utilities and small applications ) .

A dry joint is a solder joint that has not been properly soldered , a solder joint being the connection of any of the electronic components to the main circuit board . A dry joint can be fixed using a soldering iron , and a bit of solder . Although you do have to know where it is , and be able to access that area . If you are lucky ( and have a friend with a soldering iron ) you might be able to find it , although I suspect it ’ s either going to be a trip to an engineer , or a new monitor .",1

"What made you interested in web accessibility ? As with CSS , my first real contact with accessibility came with my job at Salford . Although I was peripherally aware of the concept , and had previously heard mentions of the WCAG ( Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ) , it was never something I thought I needed to concern myself with . However , researching some of the legal requirements involving educational websites in the UK , I inevitably came across SENDA ( Special Educational Needs and Disabilities Act ) and the wider DDA ( Disabilities Discrimination Act ) . To summarise very broadly , the DDA demands , among other things , that the provision of goods and services should be ( within reason ) accessible to anybody . In its initial state , the DDA did only cover businesses and government bodies , making a special exception for educational establishments . SENDA , which effectively became part IV of the DDA , removed this special status , bringing education back under the general provisions of the main DDA . Although the Act itself does not directly mention web sites , the 'Code of Practice - Rights of Access Goods , Facilities , Services and premises ' does , and it is understood that therefore all government , education and business sites need to make 'reasonable adjustments ' to ensure a basic level of accessibility . So , having started my position as web editor at the University of Salford and realising the legal requirement imposed by SENDA/DDA , I began delving deeper into the subject of accessibility . What I found was that , even among 'seasoned ' web managers in the UK education sector and beyond , there was a lot of ignorance and confusion - coupled with misinformed management concerned with 'Bobby validation ' as the be all and end all . This sorry state of affairs , combined with the fact that , deep down , I feel that accessibility is simply the ethically/morally right thing to do , led me to explore this subject further . I find it fascinating that even though in recent years more and more sites , books and even conferences have been devoted to accessibility , there are still many grey areas once you move beyond the basics , where even experts can furiously disagree . It 's not all cut and dry , and in many instances one has to take a pragmatic approach , weighing up how things should be done ( according to things like W3C specifications or even common sense ) against how they work in practice ( in light of flaky browser or assistive technology support , for instance ) .",1

"How do you create HD 3D video games for the PS3 or XBox 360 ? It 's important that it 's HD . If possible , can youlist the name of software that helps ? I do n't know much about console programming.ALso , along with the software name , can you give me web sites that might help , and a number of the best programming languages . What you need is the SDK ( Software Development Kit ) for the particular console that you are developing for . Unfortunally these kits usually cost $ 10+ and even more unfortunally you ca n't get them . Most Console license holders ( like Microsoft or Sony ) will only lease a kit to you if you a big company with an active title in development and a published deal ready . It is almost impossible to get a kit if you are a single developer.I suggest making a PC game with DirectX , the directX SDK is free . It is a good place to get started and Microsoft 's Xbox uses a very similar almost identical interface . So if you can swing a publisher deal and convince Microsoft to let use use a SDK you wo n't have much trouble getting your game to work on the XBox.When you game is ready License holder will put your game through a set of rigorious tests to see if it is stable and conforms to all the rules of the particular system , if that all works out they will allow you to release the game.Almost every professional game with VERY few exceptions are written in C++.Compared to all this making the game work on a HD Televison is trival .",1

"how to correct red eye in photography ? If you want to eliminate red-eye before your photo even makes it into the computer : Red eye is caused when flash is fired directly into the eye , bounces off the red blood vessels at the back of the eye , and is reflected back into the lens.The solution would be to fire the flash at an angle , for example , downwards towards the subjects , rather than right at them . This would require an external flash unit that has a swivel head , and of course , for inexpensive point and shoots , this is not really an option , but I put it out there . Not only will you eliminate red eye but you will greatly improve the look of your photos is you learn how to use an external flash unit properly and bounce light off nearby walls.Or , in some cases , why not turn off the flash altogether and prop your camera against a surface or use a tripod , and get the subjects to stay still a little . Not possible when you 're in the middle of the action , or in very poorly lit areas , but sometimes doable . Your pictures will be a lot better off without the harsh light that those built in flash units provide .",1

Anti-virus softwares prevent your computer from receiving malicious scripts made by programming softwares , otherwise known as viruses . These viruses can do many things that can either be just a plain nuisance or something that can seriously damage your computer . I suggest not going without an Anti-virus software ; if you can find any software that 's legit , then use it .

"What is the difference between a desktop and a workstation ? I am thinking about alienware , any suggestions. ? I need lots of computing power w/ the option of using for media/games . Systems about $ 1500 . There may have been a distinction between a desktop and a workstation in the past but there 's only a faint gray line that differentiates the two today . A workstation can do anything a consumer desktop can and vice versa . So essentially , they mean the same thing.If you ask Dell or Alienware , however , they 'll probably say workstations are for business and desktops are for consumers . For computer manufacturers , a workstation usually means some of the latest technology . They tend to have SATAII , beefier minimum RAM than deskops , and stronger processors for their `` base systems '' . Of course , you could always configure a base consumer desktop with all of that , so the distinction is moot.If you look carefully , though , there may be one or two small differences . Workstations may prefer to use more expensive ECC RAM . Their video cards may be ISV-certified and use `` workstation-level '' video graphic cores ( nVidia Quadro instead of GeForces , ATI FireGL instead of Radeons ) . And almost always , their starting configurations tend to use a CDROM ( cause , you know , why would you need a DVD burner for work ? ! ) .Again , all of this can be changed . You can buy a workstation with a DVD burner , you can stick in a GeForce 7800GTX , and most likely you can use non-ECC RAM ( check motherboard requirements first though ) .So if you 're an avid gamer and need a good media machine , something from Alienware should do just fine . Personally I would choose a no-frills basic model like Dell 's XPS400 or E510 , get memory from Crucial.com ( or a good local store ) , and buy the video card from NewEgg.com . I 'm not familiar with molecular modeling programs but I would ask around if they are multi-processor enabled applications ( which means can more than one processor be recognized by the program ) . If so , you may want to get a dual-core processor as the modeling program can take advantage of the extra core and help with the number crunching . If not , then choosing a regular single-core CPU would suit you fine and save some cash ( it would be money wasted as games do n't effectively use a second core ) . For RAM , ask around about your modeling program because it would be primarily your task . For games , you 'll want at least 1GB of RAM . For video cards , I would chose whatever your budget allows you . The Nvidia 6600/6800/7800 lines are really good right now and I would n't suggest any ATIs at the moment except for the top-of-the-line X850/X1800 .",1

Please help , this problem only started today . I 've tried system restore , but it still doesnt help solve the problem . Have you used these CD-RW 's before ? If so , you may need to erase the discs prior to burning the new data . If you re-use the discs without erasing , they may be `` multisession '' discs , and you 're simply out of sessions ( not sure of the limit , but there is one ) .Also , if these discs are re-used with any degree of frequency , you have have exceeded the re-use count . Typically CD-R/W discs are rated for up to 1000 rewrites . Once you get beyond this , the rewritable surface begins to deteriorate too much to store any data.According to Dell 's website , the optical drive options are either a CD-ROM drive , DVD-ROM drive , DVD-ROM drive with CD-R/RW , or a DVD-R/RW . Any chance it 's a DVD-ROM with CD-R/RW and you 're trying to burn a DVD-R/W disc ? Sorry , but I have to ask.Otherwise , the drive may be failing and in need of service .

"Not including Apple , what company makes the best labtops and why ? Thank you. ? I am looking to buy a new laptop and i know very little about them or computers period for that matter . I 'm looking for reliabilty more than anything else . I dont want to be fixing the damn thing up every two weeks . No screen problems , no crashing motherboards , no excessive overheating . I hope you guys can help ! ! ! Thanks again . Also if you could give me a crash course on computer specifications and what exactly they mean . ( gigahertz , pentium , celeron ) what is all that a measurement of , and how should it affect me when i go to buy my notebook . What should i be looking for . I 'll be using the notebook for internet and typing papers . Thanks guys ! ! ! I work on an HP Compaq NC6000 that work supplied me and I like it . I 've had it over a year . It 's been reliable and fast . My wife has owned a Toshiba for over three years.I surf the internet , play music on it , write technical papers , send e-mails , write programs , and run numerical analyses on it.Battery life could be better . I can only go for about an hour and a half before the battery depletes.If you are going to be taking notes in classes , you may want to get two batteries for it so you can get several hours of uptime without connecting to a power supply.The rest of it ... Gigahertz , Pentium , Celeron , AMD really does n't matter these days . Almost any laptop will play DVDs ( with a DVD player ) , CDs , etc plenty fast.In fact , the lower the Gigahertz ( the clock rate which at which the processor ( AMD or Intel ) ticks along ) , the longer your batter life may be . Slowest Gigahertz you should go with is about 1.5GHz.I would make sure that the notebook has at least 512MB of memory , preferably 1GB . This is important if you run several programs at once ( e-mail , internet , music player , and word processor ) . If you do n't , things can slow down and wear down battery life faster as data is moved on and off disk.I would go with a 15 '' LCD . 17 '' is better if you are at your desk all the time , but if you are carrying the thing around a lot , the smaller display makes for a more compact laptop .

"What are the problems the No Child Left Behind Act has presented ? The biggest problem is that it makes teachers focus on teaching to a test rather than just teaching . Knowing how to take the test is more important , under this system , than knowing what is on it . Further , the act has been severely underfunded . The act requires more qualified teachers ( aka ones with more education ) , but more education means higher pay , which is something many school districts ca n't do.I think more importantly than any of those problems , there 's the issue of how to measure improvement . Under the act each class is compared to the previous class , meaning this year 's 2nd grade is compared to last year 's 2nd grade . Now , obviously comparing different groups of kids is fundamentally unfair . People do n't like to admit it , but some people have different base levels of intelligence . Certainly everyone who is not developmentally challenged should be able to pass high school reasonably , but to fault a school and its teachers simply because one class is , on average , not quite as smart is the most asinine thing I can think of . Thankfully the DOE is starting a pilot program of comparing student scores across their school careers ( comparing last year 's 2nd grade scores to this year 's 3rd grade scores ) . That is obviously the better way to do it , but making the switch is going to cost money , something the act has failed to provide .",0

I love harry potter books without them i wouldnt read as much as i do Just because you read a book about harry potter does n't mean you 're going to want to perform witchcraft . People often think that way because of the ways they were brought up . ( Values , morals , religon of upbringing , etc ) If you do want to do anything that is considered `` magic '' in the movie , in reality , you would n't be doing witchcraft at all.Witchcraft is a pretty broad term . Generally now , modern witchcraft is now called Wicca , and is not really `` witchcraft '' at all . It 's a real religion , although the whole concept of `` Wicca '' and `` religion '' is really debated in the communityPS : `` Jesus Freak '' did n't answer the question . she just made a blind statement .",0

"Should I buy step-in snowboard bindings ? I used these before and really liked them , but a few friends told me not to buy them . But I like the convenience ! it 's all personal preference . Step in 's were the bomb in about 98 . One thing to notice is that not many companies make true `` step-in 's '' nowadays . Burton has a hybrid binding called the Fusion . It looks like a regular strap binding , but the straps are on a frame that can detach from the base plate . It 's hard to explain but really kool.Flows are the other main choice . The back flips down and you slide your boot in . It 's quick but i do n't know if the single top piece would cause pressure points.K2 also has a binding where the back drops down , very similar to Flows . Personally , i 'd say no to step ins and yes to a very comfortable strap binding . The time you `` save '' stepping in will just be wasted waiting for your friends to strap in .",0

"Dose the moon orbit the sun ? If we just look at the sun , earth , moon system , all three bodies orbit the center of mass of this 3-body system . Since the sun is much more massive than the other two bodies , the location of the center of mass of this system is inside the sun , so the sun moves very little , while the earth and moon appear to orbit the sun.Now , the earth and the moon also interact gravitationally , and they orbit the center of mass of the earth moon system The center of mass of this earth-moon system is located inside the earth , so the moon looks like it orbits the earth . You can view the earth and moon as being in orbit around their center of mass , and the earth-moon system center of mass being in orbit around the earth-sun-moon system.If the sun , earth , moon had equivalent masses , and if there were no other gravity bodies in the universe , they would appear to have orbits around the center of mass of this smaller earth , moon , sun system.I think the term '' orbit '' can be a little confusing because it 's not always clearly defined . The gravitational attraction of the sun on the moon is greater than the earth 's attraction on the moon , so you could also argue that the moon really orbits the sun , with it 's orbit modified by the earth .",0

"Do `` mexican jumping beans '' really jump ? What 's the secret ? Yes , Mexican Jumping Beans really jump !

"How can I get back together with my ex-wife ? Our split up was due to a really bad situation . No adultery involved . However the tust was shattered ! Not knowing the details , it is tough to answer , but there are various types of women out there , and for some , trust is everything . If you did enough to make her leave you , it must have been pretty bad . I would assume ( since I do n't know the circumstances ) that either there have always been trust issues , or that your infidelity ( of whichever type ) was long standing and ongoing , and so she felt betrayed . In both cases , I do n't know if there is anything you could do . If she left because of pure emotional reaction , you might have a chance , but if it was an intellectual decision , it is not likely to work . Emotion can be reasoned with - an overreaction can be dealt with , but logic is usually rock solid . You could offer therapy for you both , however if you are already 'divorced ' , it seems a little too final to try that . Apologies alone wo n't really get you anywhere . Not much of an answer , but without any details , it 's the best I 've got . My main advice though is to know when to give up . Some battles ca n't be won . At some point , you might have to just count your losses , consider this an expensive learning experience , and do n't make the same mistake next time .",0
"A child is suffereing from cardiac myopathy and she is given 24 hours medicne injected ( connected to machine ) D Doctors suggest she can live only with support of medicines . Is that true . Is there any other solution . she is only 1 year old . So surgery is not possible.Is there any cure for such patients how long they can survive , can they live without medicine . plesase advice Cardiomyopathy is a chronic and sometimes progressive disease in which the heart muscle ( myocardium ) , is abnormally enlarged , thickened and/or stiffened . The condition typically begins in the walls of the heart 's lower chambers ( ventricles ) , and in more severe cases also affects the walls of the upper chambers ( atria ) . The actual muscle cells as well as the surrounding tissues of the heart become damaged . Eventually , the weakened heart loses the ability to pump blood effectively and heart failure or irregular heartbeats ( arrhythmias or dysrhythmia ) may occur . The medication that she is being given is probably being used to help the heart contract or function better . The medication being given by machine is just to make sure it is n't given too quickly because of how small your child is.It is likely she will need some sort of medication the rest of her life . If she is a candidate for a heart transplant , she will still need to be on some sort of medication the rest of her life.You need to speak to your daughters Pediatrian or Cardiac Doctor if you have questions . This site ca n't address these questions as well as he/she could for you .",0
"What is a less toxic alternative to Chemo therapy for breast cancer treatment in a woman ? To be honest , chemotherapy is not a cancer treatment . Here is the situation . Chemo can take care of the problem right away , but the doctor always says that , some can live an extended 2 years , or 3 years . And some die right away from the chemicals . This is with late stages of cancer . Now , for early stages , it helps the problem but your health is deteriorated . They say that chemo affects the cancer and your normal body cells . How many people you know , who have had late stages of cancer , and lived through it pass 5 yours with chemo therapy ? I bet you that you have never even heard of it . Even if someone has , how many people is that compared to that masses ? The problem with other medicines is that the pharmaceautical companies can not control that product . What if it was tree bark say for instance . How many people do you know will buy the pills if they can just walk up to any tree and bite a piece off to save themselves ? See ? So , USA doctors are familiar with these remedies , but they do not talk about it . Try asking your doctor about green algae , or cesium chloride , or paw paw , etc etc . Then they start to talk . Otherwise , they wont say a word . And if you dont know , how can you ask ? So , the doctors lips are sealed tight . The individual doctors on the other hand are sometimes scared to talk about it . It is because , if they open their mouths , they would be facing the whole medical community . Alot of them go into the medical field to help people , and some go in it for money . But , the top ranking ones in control are all in it for money . If not , they would have never gotten their position . I do not suggest you go with chemo therapy . You can look up some alternative medicine to cancer and they are all over the place on the net . The best ranked one is cesium chloride , paw paw , and along with others . Some health websites even have a place where you can go and tell them your stage of cancer and which type of cancer , and they will sell you a package based on your individual problem . There are also some doctors scattered all over the USA who specialize in cancer . You never hear about them right ? Well , they wont be bothered by the medical community if they do a small operation without much advertising . But , they all report about 90 % survival rates on cancers that regular cancer doctors give up on . And if that doctor didnt give up , do you expect to live anyways ? No . I speak out to you because I dont want you to die like the two of my friends who have already died . Certain doctors even said that they could cure it with 80 % survival rate . But , I didnt have the money to help them . So , I am speaking out in hopes that nothing happens to you and you survive . Regardless of your stage of cancer . Cesium chloride is what works best . Look it up , its everywhere . Even oxygen drops help . You can use them both at the same time . The thing is with these alternatives is that , some of them make you feel extremely bad at the beginning , but after a while you get used to it , and then you are gone with the cancer before you know it . So dont feel discouraged . Oxygen drops keep cancer from growing because your body can live with more oxygen . As a matter of fact , it helps circulate your blood . Cancer can not live at the sight of oxygen . It has been said that not enough oxygen is what causes cancer . I dont know what the cause is , because there are many causes . But , cesium chloride and oxygen drops will take care of it . And one more thing , some of these remedies can not be sold as a cancer treatment . So , they are sold as vitamins . But , in their website , they are allowed to say what it cures . But , their labels can not say a word about cancer . So , you should start in the vitamin section of the internet . Good luck my friend .",0

Where did all the virgins go ? ? What are your thoughts on being abstinent ? Hi there , I know that the pressure of being a virgin is extremely hard for one to handle , especially in the Western societies that we live in ; but virginity is worth striking for . I 'm in my 20s and the group of friends that I have is also in their 20s and we are all virgins . I think the most important thing that one needs to keep in mind is that virginity is for ONESELF , not for anyone else ( or sometimes you might wan na save it for you future husband ) . Once you are determined about it , it would be less difficult when you think of whether to have sex or not . My friends and I choose not to have sex before marriage b/c we see SEX as LOVE , and we respect our body as well as our partners ' . When you love someone unconditionally , you do n't just want to own the physical body , do you ? ?

Believe me , when you find the one who really loves and cares for you , he would n't might if you want to save sex for marriage . ( My bf and I both compromise on that , and we 're pretty happy ) . Hope you find this a helpful ! ! Good luck !",0

Does he mean it would be ok to have low payment if he get a job ? ③Yeah , I think I 'm gon na have to go with the second rule of horse racing . Never beat a dead horse.What is the second rule mean ? 1 . He appears to be asking the man if he needs someone to look after his horses . He is suggesting that he would like to do take this job as he is keen to get back into training horses which is what he has done before.2 . Yes . He is saying that he would be willing to accept less money than normal to do the job.3 . Beat a dead horse ( actually the real expression is - Flog a dead horse ) is an expression which means to do something which has no point because it is already settled . For example , if a child asked his mother for something and she said NO and would not change her mind , then to keep asking can be described as - Beating ( Flogging ) a dead horse . In your example it possibly is referring to the pointlessness of asking for work when none is on offer . But it is also meant to be funny in this case because the subject is actually about horses : - ) The expression probably comes from the pointlessness of beating a horse ( to make it work harder ) if it is dead ! !",0

His failure to enforce the laws which keep the capitalist system of this country running have led to price gouging of fuels , and that 's compounding our economic troubles . Under his administration , we have made several cuts to energy subsidies for the poor ( which he promised not to do while campaigning ) , and in the face of his carefree attitude towards the illegal activities of the oil companies , people have frozen to death in their homes.The manufacturing in the military-industrial sector combined with a purely reactionary attitude towards environmentalism has led to a toxic level of perchlorates in the breast milk of almost ALL of the women tested for it . We ca n't even set up a control group because everyone is so laden with perchlorates . Perchlorates cause brain damage in nursing children.His budgets allocate federal funds for private , religious organizations.In violation of the due process of the law and our long held principles which prohibit unlawful search and seazure , he has the NSA spy on Americans and subpeonas search engines to find out what everyone in the country is searching for.He abandons science in favor of ideology . He refuses to heed the warnings of climatologists . His hostile attitude towards medicine and biology is threatening the very foundations of American industry , innovation and science . His cronies are trying to censor and suppress scientific journals which give sound evidence to something that should be intuitively obvious -- logging does n't help forests recover from forest fire.He was an alcoholic and a cokehead until he was 40 . His `` choice '' to become President was made when , according to him , he realized that he `` was 40 and wondering what to do with his life . '' He is in office only because Americans have strayed so far from their liberal founding principles that they would rather see a dynastic succession of aristocracy than a government of scholars and public servants.He abandoned Afghanistan , where the terrorists were and are , to take us to war in Iraq , where they are n't . He lied to do this . After doing that , his administration gave no-bid contracts to Halliburton , whose former CEO is now your vice-president . The price of doing this is that we are now unable to deal with a growing threat in Iran , and while only a few years ago we were berating the international community and the UN Security Council , the best we can now manage is to threaten to refer Iran to the UN Security Council.Under his administration , we have begun to use the CIA to fly people who are only suspected of something to old Soviet facilities where we torture them . We hold people for long periods of time without charging them with a crime.He pushed an energy bill through congress which relaxes the efficiency requirements for coal burning power plants . His reason ? To correct an impending energy crisis by making it worse . Companies wanting to build nuclear reactors are guaranteed a loan from the government to do so , they are no longer liable for nuclear accidents , and if their inspection process is halted for any reason , the government hands b",0

First start with builing up distance ... walk 1-3 miles . Once you are comfortable with that- work on your speed . Slowly your walk will be a fast walk , and then eventually a jog . Build up your speed and distance over several weeks . Remember do n't do it too fast . Any excerise is more than none ( and better than hurting yourself . )",0

"Im keeping a food diary to control my food intake , as I have to drop about 30 pounds . Does it really work ? Experts say writing down your eating habits will keep your diet on track -- even when you slip up and eat a few things you wish you hadn't.Food journals can help keep portions under control . For example , do n't just write that you ate chicken for dinner . Write down how many ounces that piece of chicken was . And how many pieces you consumed . Information on gauging portions can be found on the Internet . If you are not seeing a dietician , you can cross-check your daily food intake with the USFDA food guide pyramid . The Food and Nutrition Information Center Web site provides a USFDA food guide pyramid at www.nalusda.gov/fnic/index.html . The Web site includes USFDA food pyramids for ethnic foods as well.Wondering if you 've eat enough servings of fruit and vegetables ? A food journal can help you figure it out . While it 's not helpful to everyone , many people report food journal success.No matter what you 're weight loss or eating goal , scribbling your snacking habits down is a good idea , experts say .

When is the new spouse held responsible for any debts ? Any info you have would be appreciated . Thanks . There are some general legal principles:1 . Spouses are generally presumed to co-own anything gained during the marriage and be responsible for any debts incurred during the marriage.2 . But there are a whole lot of exceptions.3 . And there is no way to know how these rules would be applied in each case . It 's all exceptionally fact-specific.4 . The only way to get a handle on the issues is to consult with a lawyer.5 . But you should never presume that you `` do n't have the money '' to get divorced or that it would be financially ruinous . For the non-monied spouse , the news is usually a lot better than she might expect.6 . See a lawyer .",0

"Why oil , ghee , butter and fried food is restricted for a daibatic , while they do not contain sugar ? Because everything you eat turns into glucose .

Protiens and complex carbohydrates turn to glucose slowest . So , eat lots of green veggies , beans , whole grains and lean meats and strictly limit or just do n't eat white flour , white rice , potatos , sugar , honey , corn syrup etc.If America were to eat like they have diabetes , this country would n't have as many over weight people who just might become diabetic !

"do u think that lies saves u from bein ur self ? I do n't think I would use the word 'saves ' . I 'll ignore your grammar and spelling and whatnot and try to answer what I think you might be asking.To say that lies 'save ' you from being yourself implies that you do n't like who you are and that you think that the fabrications are better than reality . In fact , it 's the opposite . Lies , if you tell them often , do separate you from who you really are in that they are false , and provide the one you 're lying to with a false impression of you . They tend to amalgamate until you 're boxed in by your own stories . They start to add up and keeping them all straight is difficult , and there are almost always discrepancies . If you lie too much , it can make people hate you for deceiving them . If there 's something you do n't like about your life , so much as to lie about it , then I would suggest changing who you are instead . Fix it , and then you can be honest with everyone , yourself included.However , if you must lie , I would stay as absolutely close to the truth as possible . It makes them that much more believable .",0

"what is the relation between feng shui and architecture ? Feng Shui is a science , based in numerology among other factors as the 5 elements ( Fire , Wood , Water , Metal & Earth ) the 8 cardinal directions and the application of many other formulas.According to Feng Shui we all have a Kua number , this number is determined by your date of birth . Each kua number has 8 directions , we all have 4 good directions and 4 bad directions . Also the date of building is very important , that way one can know in which period the house is being built or was built , right now we find ourselves in period 8 ! Let 's say U want to built a house and your very best first direction is North , then U will orientand design your home plans according to these directions . A total Feng Shui house can be design by this Kua number and also with the help of different formulas e.g Land Scape Feng Shui,8 Mansions , Flying Star , Etc.Plan the layout of a house by identifying the good sectors and not so good sectors after examining the flying star natal chart of a house . Identify if there are any specials such as parent string combinations in your flying star chart , and plant to augment their good luck by incorporating an open-spaced concept within your house . Then work with shapes when activating the feng shui of the different sectors of your house.Actually Feng Shui is becoming more and more popular with the years and many architects are already working together with Feng Shui Consultants to design floor plans of a house , building or residential complex ! Many celebreties follow this science , e.g . Donald Trump !

"is a criminal justice a lawyer that goes to court and defends people ? is like what is the diference between pre law studies , criminal justice , law , advanced legal reaserch , coparative law and international law . Haha , no - criminal justice refers to the field of study that examines crime as a social phenomenon , and traditional focuses on the agents , procedures , and systems that societies create in order to deal with crime.Pre-law studies are just that ; they are tracks that some universities offer for those who want to go to law school and who may ( or may not ) know what area of law they want to get in to . From what I understand , these tracks usually consist of courses aimed at improving students ' oral and written communication skills , their critical/analytical thinking , and creativity . Most also provide a survey of the different kinds of law , as well as giving you a historical backdrop for the practice.Advanced legal research - I am not sure what you mean , but legal research in general refers to the process of digging up the legal matters surrounding some topic or issue . This is a complicated and tedious process , so I do n't know if legal research is ever NOT `` advanced . '' : - ) Comparative law studies laws between different countries ( e.g . British law versus Chinese law ) and between different legal systems ( e.g . common law versus civil law ) .International law studies the rules that govern conduct between independent states . The International Criminal Court ( ICC ) is a good example of the enactment of international law.I 'm not a law student , so I might be off ... clarification is welcome from those actually in the field !",0

Did your muscles ever get sore from working out ? For me , after a while , my muscles do not get sore ; they get used to the exercises I do and to the number of reps I do . It does n't matter so much if your muscles get sore as it does that you are getting results . If you are accomplishing what you want , either gains in size , strength or definition , then it does n't really matter.On the other hand , maybe you are n't doing enough sets .

"why is probability sampling prefered over non probability sampling ? Probabilty sampling allows you to perform stastistical analysis , such as regression , correlation and so on . They can also be crafted to be extremely representative of the population . You can also construct confidence intervals ( for example : 54 % of Americans support the bill with a margin of error of +/- 2 % ) . You can also use stastitical methods to prove casality or other relationships . Non probability sampling can not be used with stastical analysis , thus we can have no margin or error , correlation , etc . However , given a sufficiently large sample size , non probability sampling can still be useful for getting a 'pulse ' of the total population .",0

An attenuator is used to reduce the level of a signal . A single attenuator will not work the same with any load , because the input and output impedances of the attenuator should be matched to the characteristic impedances of the system in which it is used.One of the simplest forms of attenuator is a resistive T or pi network , which is basically just an electronic `` divider '' circuit . If you know the attenuator resistor and output impedance values , you just apply Ohm 's Law to calculate the input/output ratio .

There have not been many direct applications of chaos theory so far , but the study of chaos and the emphasis on understanding chaos has given us new methods of research.One of the best examples I can think of is agent-based modelling in social sciences . For example , in theoretical combat , there is an old equation called Lanchester 's equation of combat , which predicts the casualty rate in a given time period for two different armies o fgiven sizes with given accuracies . Unfortunately , it tends not to be terribly accurate in numerical forescasts of battle outcomes . This is because the battle outcome depnds on the behavior of individual troops on the battlefield , and small changes in their behavior can cause big changes in battle outcome.The idea that small changes in an input cause big changes in an output is the essence of chaos theory . This has led to agent based modelling in which researchers assign behavioral attributes to individual troops rather than use a single variable to define a whole army . The computer calculates each troops interation with his own troops and with the enemy 's , and you get an outcome . Small changes in troop behavior will cause large changes in outcome . This can tell researchers what behaviors of soldiers may be most important to modify even slghtly.Observations of very different outcomes from small changes in starting conditions have led reserachers in all sorts of other fields to also attempt to understand this difference . Chemical engineers are often trying to understand tubulence and how small changes in pipe shapes can casue big changes in the way fluid flows .",0

If you are in gifted and talented education ( TAG , GT , etc . ) talk to your teacher also . You may need teachers to sponsor the skip , a psychological evaluation that states not only that you can handle the level of education but also the social change , letters from your parents/legal guardians , and even possibly an attorney .

"More Question to Muslim ? I am sorry this is just for My Knowladge.I do n't mean to provoke anything.Thank for a good answer.==========================What is women in Islam think about poligamy . I made some studies in Modern Muslim country it look like they do n't like poligamy.At what age Muhammad married Aishah ( Hope I am writting correctly ) and how many wife he have ? ? Why and what is the reason behind that . Dear SellCar , i really hope you got a good reason behind those questions , anyways ill answer your question.i read some strange answer above ; ( , so i hope i can make it clear Ofcourse every woman hates polygamy , God created woman to hate anyone that shares her love , but in Holy Quran it says and made it clear for men that they should not take more than one wife unless they have their reasons , like for example some wives dont have the ability to be pregnant , its no body 's fault of course but as a man everyone likes to be a father , therefore he can marry another wife.another reason for men might be that some men need more than one woman and he is not getting enough , therefore he could make sin with other woman which is bad for Islam teachings and social life and reputation , or he can marry another woman that will give him more pleasure and in the same time he is not making any sin.Moreover , if you now make a study you will find that number of men is much more less than number of women in the world , years ago in Germany they where surprised to find that 1 man is being borned for every 4 women ! ! for a reason that no one knows except God he knew that this will be the case , therefore he authorised to have more than wife , or else we will have more than half of the woman not married for the rest of their lives . ( speaking about Islam societies only , western countires men and woman stays with no marriage usually for the rest of their lives ) God authorised polygamy for more better reasons ofcourse , but i only know these.and of course there is no polygamy for men in Islam ; ) , because at that stage we cant know who is son or daughter of whom.and for a man being with a legal woman is ofcourse much better than being with a new woman everyday or month ; ( Islam makes a great social life by its teachings.============i really dont know the exact age of Muhammad ( PBUH ) when he married Aisha , but i think in 40's.God didnt authorise for muslims to marry more than four wives and in a certain conditions , but for messenger of God ( Muhmmad PBUH ) he authorised for him to marry more , i do know one reason now for this is that Mohammad ( PBUH ) wanted to make links with the arab tribes across arabia to spread Islam , and as a messenger of God marrying one of the women in a tribe it was a very good impression to make for those tribes , which later he made friendship with them and they followed Islam teachings , therefore marrying more than one wife helped the spread of Islam at that time , and it made for Islam a good base in Arabia .",0

"What is your opinion of scientific medicine ... ? Do you think doctors , drug companies , etc . have ( in general ) our best interest in mind ? Do you think we have become a society too dependent on pills ? Do you think there is a real , significant benefit to using herbs and natural `` cures '' and preventatives as opposed to either using `` medicine '' or not using anything ? How do you deal with the people who think you are a quack for believing in natural remedies ? That 's quite a bit to sort through . I 'll do my best.I believe that individual doctors almost always have the best interests of their patients in mind . Medicine as a whole , however , is far more interested in the bottom line . This applies especially to the drug companies . From what I understand certain diseases do n't have enough people suffering from them to make it profitable to research treatments for them . Or , if the research has been done , there is not enough profit in manufacturing drugs to treat these people . I 've even read that there are boutique chemists who make , by hand , very small runs of certain drugs at no profit to themselves , simply to help out.As far as I 'm concerned , this is inexcusable . Do I have a solution ? No . Are alternative treatments viable ? I 'm sure that sometimes they are and sometimes they are not . Again , the problem comes down to making a buck . People who are suffering are , unfortunately , easy marks and snake-oil-salesmen have known this since the dawn of civilization.The problem becomes sorting the con-men from the well-meaning , but dangerously untrained , from the people with actual remedies . This is very difficult and requires a tremendous amount of work on the part of people who often lack the time and energy to do the necessary legwork because they are sick.Coretta Scott King died seeking medical help from a quack . It is awful that she suffered such an undignified end , but as long as there are people to be taken advantage of , others will do their best to part them from their money . Obviously not all alternative treatments are quackery , but they often get lumped together because of the actions of a few ( many , actually ) bad apples . I would suggest that the alternative-therapy industry engage in harsher self-policing as a way to remove the undeserved black-mark.As for you responding to questions which are specifically targeted at individuals , I welcome this . The thing that I like most about Yahoo Answers is that it is a place that encourages the free exchange of ideas between anybody . I do n't think that anyone can , or should , get upset when a targeted question receives several answers . That 's the best thing about this place . So , feel free to throw your two cents in anytime . I really appreciate your response about Bush and Christians . I 'd be very curious to hear what this man , who presumes to speak for all Christian Americans would have to say about that . Thanks for your input .",0

"My 4th grade son is haveing MAJOR difficulties at school and I 'm considering homeschooling him.Any ideas ? I 'm having problems with the principal and I 've even talked to the superintendent . I do n't expect much help there but if they 're going to label my son as a `` troublemaker '' or someone who needs `` more counselling than just talking to a therapist '' ( the prinipal told me she thinks he should be `` institutionalized '' which the counsellor even disagrees with ) then I do n't see the point of putting him back into that situation . I live in a very small rural town with very limited counselling options which I am taking advantage of . I do n't have too many disciplinary problems with him at home but at school he 's been having `` meltdowns '' which have caused him to be suspended 2 times in the past 2 weeks plus a 5 day suspension for a comment he supposedly said . I ca n't move him to a nearby town 's school because they do n't accept kids after the start of the second semester . I just want him to pass 4th grade so he can go on to 5th grade with a different principal and hopefully a better prospect . HELP ! I went through a very similar situation and after months of being told by the teacher and the principal that there must be a problem at home , I found out another child was having the same problems mine was . The other mom and I got together and came up with a plan . We each got our child to tell us why the other child was having so much trouble.Turned out there was another child in the class bullying and intimidating ours so badly that there were days they spent all their time huddled under their desks . While I still could not get the school to admit to a problem , I did find a sympathetic vice principal who allowed my child access to her office at any time he felt he could not handle being in the class anymore . It was n't the perfect solution but it got us to the end of that school year and I made sure I had some say in what class he went into the next year . Things improved after that . If you truly are not having discipline problems at home and the only place there really seems to be a problem is at school , then I would be looking very hard at why there is a problem at school . Do n't take the teacher 's word for anything ... that teacher may very well be the problem . Talk to other parents and find out if anyone else is going through something similar to what you are . Make sure your child understands that you know there is a problem and you are doing your best to help . Let him know he has you on his side . Good luck . Sure would like to know the outcome of this one .",0

"What is Raggaetone ? Reggaeton is a form of dance music which has become popular with Latin America in youth during the late 1990s and has spread to North American and European audiences during the first few years of the 21st century . Reggaeton ( also spelled with the Spanish accent as Reggaetón , and sometimes as Reguetón in Spanish ) - blends Jamaican music influences of reggae and dancehall with those of Latin America , such as bomba and plena , as well as that of hip hop . The music is combined with rapping ( generally ) in Spanish . Reggaeton has empowered the Spanish Caribbean youth , specifically those of Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic , as well as the Latin American and United States Latino communities , with a musical genre as a voice . More recently it has become an international movement with the help of many from New York 's Latino and Black hip hop community.While it takes influences from hip hop and dancehall , it would be wrong to define reggaeton as the 'Spanish'- or 'Latino'- version of either of these genres ; reggaeton has its own specific beat and rhythm , whereas Latino hip hop is simply hip hop sung by artists of Latino descent . Reggaeton 's distinguishing feature is the Dem Bow beat ( alternately spelled Dembow ) , which originated in a song by Shabba Ranks in the mid-1990s.Reggaeton lyrics tend to be more derived from hip hop than dancehall . Like hip hop , reggaeton has caused controversy due to its often explicit lyrics and alleged exploitation of women [ 1 ] . Further controversy surrounds perreo , a dance with explicit sexual overtones which typically accompanies reggaeton music",0

"i dunno how to have sex & i'l b gettin maried soon.being a muslim i cant evr do it b4 my weding.i need help ? actually being a muslim and then eastern culture we girls dont know much about sex.my fiance like girls who are active sexually.i dunno how to do it.im scared i wont b able to satisfy him.i tried searching online but didnt get get any proper information.its not possible for me to buy those kinda books or watch movies that would help me.coz first of all they arent that easily available and my family wont ever let me watch it.but my fiance really wants me to know more about it.what can i do about it ? where can i get the info from ? i know the obvious answer that many are probably thinking , if he loves you then you will be fine . in fact the is not at true as most people would like to think . Your not just talking about sex you 're talking about intamcy as well . WHen you do have sex for the first time i wo n't lie it hurts . The reason it will hurt for the most part is because oyu will be so nervous about be nakeed and having sex that all of your muscles will be conctracting . Which will then in turn make it that more difficult for your finance to enter . just remeber that when you have sex with him that he loves oyu he wo n't be juding you in anyway he will be overwhelmed with the fact that he is with you for the rest of his life that he will just be in awe . also keep in mind that the first time is going to be a little bumpy because you two do n't know each others movements yets . so yees it will be awkward . having sex for the first time is different for eeveryone . but it may be easier , since it seems to me that he has had sex before , if he were to get on top . so that way you wo n't feeel that yopu have to do everything . Something that might make it easier is buy some kind of lubercation it makes it easier to get sttarted . with the lubercation you put it on him to make it more arousing for him and this will give you and oppurtunity to see , and feel what your husband feels like . make it fun for yourself . while you are doing that for him he could be doing something for you . either kissing your neck messaging your inner thighs . if you have a little for play it might take away some of the tension . It is most definetly going to be hard for you to be doing all of this . but just remeber that it will get easier . do n't forget that he 's not the only one that is there for fun . soemthing that might also arouse him and you as well is take is hands and put them on various parts of you and then you return the favor while he carressing you you do the same . moving on to the sex part of it . pull him towaards you so that he knows to get on top . then opoen your legs so that it is comfortable to you and he can get his whole body in . if you do n't feel comfortable adjust and then proceed . when he starts to insert in to you MAKE SURE HE GOES SLOWLY . if anything starts to hurt tell him adn he should either stop or pull out . the key is to communicate . IT will be uncomfortable the first couple of times that you do it . but the lubercation should help out to some degree . After he has entered all the way , now is the time when you should be more relaxed . Now the hardest paart is over . While haveing sex make suree at all times that you are comfortable if your not then sex just wo n't be the same later . if your lower back hurts put a pillow under neith your back and continue . if you do n't know how to move your body then have him move your body so that you both will enjoy it . and if you feel comfortable enough you amy want to get on top . If you do get on to , then just bend your knees so that they are by his hips , and sit directly over top of his penis . oncew he is back inside then move back towards is knees slightly and begin to move . if you do n't know how take is haveds and put them on your hips and let him know that he needs to help . once he gets you going you can do it on your own . Of course this is all just a suggestion and you should do what feels right to you , i hope that i could help you CONGRADULATIONS and good luck . just remember RELAX .",0

Well obvious Mr. Savage is going for a reaction , as I presume are you , and somewhat successfully too.I ca n't deny its not fun to antagonize our liberal friends , as you are , but of course at the end of the day , the blind following of ideals from either end of the political spectrum , is the main stay of democracy .

Not only will they support a religious Jihad that kills innocent people but they will blame it on the innocent people that are killed because we 'just do n't understand ' our attackers .

"What do you think about the recent trade between sczerbiak and ricky davis ? This trade definitely sucked for the twolves . Davis for Szczerbiak is a good trade , as they 're both swingmen with different strengths . Boston needed a big guy that can spot shoot , and Minnesota needed a guard .

Getting rid of Olowokandi and Sczcerbiak leaves KG as the only big man on the Twolves.Since neither team will make the playoffs this year , Boston will definitely get a lottery pick from Minnesota , and they 'll get to keep their own .

"What is the best diet pill for weight loss ? Good question . I will answer by first saying that diet pills are a fraud . Any pill that says you can lose weight by taking it and doing nothing else is wrong.Losing weight is not losing weight if you put it back on . That ’ s what diet pills do , why do you think there is a new popular one every few months.Now if you wonder if there are any good supplements and my answer is yes.There are some supplements that you can take that can enhance a very healthy diet and fitness program and help you to stay committed to it . 7 Keto is an awesome metabolic enhancing compound that helps to reduce body weight and body fat by giving you more of a hormone that tells your thyroid to increase your metabolism . You may say wow , that ’ s what I need . No , the 7-Keto is all you need , not the other stuff . Yes but no , see the body can only take so much of it at a time before its eliminated by the blood and the rest becomes expensive urine . So you cant just take it alone , it must be part of a plan.Hoodia appears to affect the brain by making the stomach feel full and reducing the desire to eat . Offers safe , caffeine-free , non-stimulant weight management support . It also may help in metabolizing fats.Multivitamins - help you maintain the muscle that you have by providing nutrients your cells need . Understand if you don ’ t put enough nutrients in your body , you will lose muscle because your body will eat the muscle for those nutrients.These supplements should be part of an overall lifestyle change , to a healthier one.There are 5 most important things that must go together in any workout program . These are part of changing your complete lifestyle to one that is healthier . They also help you to naturally optimize your metabolism . The faster your metabolism the better your body uses your food for energy , instead of storing it as fat . I put them in the order of importance.1 . Eat more . Yes eat more . More meals that is . It is best to eat a small meal every 3-4 hours . The meal should be just large enough to where you are not hungry , as opposed to eating you are full . There is a difference . Eating 1 or 2 meals a day slows your metabolism down . You should have at least 4-6 meals a day . For most people , your food should be balanced between carbs proteins and fats in a 50-25-25 ratio . Throughout your day you should maintain this ratio 2 . Drink more water . Most of us don ’ t have enough water . This means our bodies are dehydrated . Two things a dehydrated body has trouble doing , one is releasing water . In order to lose fat you must be able to release water , because fat cells in your body are composed of mostly water . A dehydrated body can not build very well . Muscle tone indicates a constant building state in your body . If your body isn ’ t building that means it is losing muscle and it ’ s never good to lose muscle that slows your metabolism and makes you look flabby.3 . Maintain a balanced workout regimen of cardio and resistance ( weights ) . Cardio is good for fat burning and it ’ s easy to do and to progress yourself . Resistance is a little harder because it ’ s not as easy to know what to do . If weights aren ’ t your thing then try Yoga or Pilates . Both are very effective resistance and core training and can help you maintain lean muscle and increase your overall metabolism.4 . Smart supplementation of your diet is your best solution to making sure you get the nutrients your food doesn ’ t give you . I mentioned 7-Keto , Hoodia , and a multivitamin plus cleanse formulas , as well as detox formulas are awesome for eliminating toxins we take into our bodies without knowing.5 . Sleep is a very important part of any healthy lifestyle regimen . When we sleep our bodies and minds refresh themselves and allow us to function at an optimal level . Sleeping allows muscles to rebuild themselves and when they do that , it speeds your metabolism.You may ask why I gave you this long list instead of just telling you what exercises",0

"where did Billie Holiday go to school ? Sounds like school was a big part of her life , if any.Born Eleanora Fagan , she had a difficult childhood which affected her life and career . Much of Holiday 's childhood is clouded by conjecture and legend , some of it propagated by herself in her autobiography published in 1956 . She was born in Philadelphia but grew up in the Fells Point section of Baltimore . According to her autobiography , her house was the first on their street to have electricity . Her mother , Sadie Fagan , was just thirteen at the time of her birth ; her father Clarence Holiday , a jazz guitarist who would play for Fletcher Henderson , was fifteen . Billie Holiday 's parents married when she was three , but they soon divorced , leaving her to be raised largely by her mother and other relatives . A hardened and angry child , she dropped out of school at an early age and , allegedly , began working as a prostitute with her mother . This preceded her move to New York with her mother sometime in the early 1930s.There is controversy regarding Holiday 's paternity . This stems from a copy of her birth certificate in Baltimore archives that lists the father as a `` Frank DeViese '' . Some historians consider this an anomaly , probably inserted by a hospital or government worker ( See Donald Clarke , Billie Holiday : Wishing on the Moon , ISBN 0306811367 ) . Clarence Holiday accepted paternity , but was hardly a responsible father . In the rare times Billie did see him , she would shake him down for money by threatening to tell his then-girlfriend that Holiday was his daughter .",0

"do fish drink water ? Web research seems to indicate that most fish do drink plenty of water , some continuously . Some fish absorb water through their skin and/or gills , and may excrete water that way , too . Apparently , fish need to maintain a fairly high concentration of salt , so how a fish deals with this need depends on whether it is a saltwater or freshwater fish . Most saltwater fish get enough or too much salt , and so preventing water loss is their concern . Freshwater fish are short on salt , and since water dilutes sodium , they have many mechanisms for excreting water . It is interesting to note that kidneys process water for excretion , so some saltwater fish have dysfunctional kidneys or are missing kidneys to help prevent water loss . The four `` water/salt '' strategies are listed below : -- -- -- Admin Note : The problem with fish vs. watery environment has do with the process of osmosis , defined as 'net movement of water molecules through a semipermeable membrane from a dilute solution to a more concentrated solution . The 'membrane ' is the 'skin ' or any other part of the fish that separates it from the water . If the concentration of salts and other solutes in the fish is greater than the outside , watery world , the fish takes on water ( natural attempt to 'dilute the fish to what it 's like outside ' - bad for the fish ) . In scientific terms the fish is hypertonic to its surroundings ( freshwater fish , e.g. ) . If a fish is hypotonic to its environment ( marine fish ) , then the seawater has a higher solute concentration than the fish ; the fish loses water to its surroundings ( also bad for the fish ) . Kidneys function to overcome the effects of osmosis so fishX can stay either more or less concentrated than its environment. -- -- --",0

"What is the preferred treatment for a large hematoma on the shin caused by trauma ? The area on the shin is large ( 3 inches by 2 inches ) and very swollen and has n't changed for 3 months . Doctor says it may take 6 months to `` go down '' and that , if not , it may need to be `` drained '' . The doctors are right . I developed one on my shin after a wreck . 6 months later it was flat and only minorly discolored , 8 months later it was no longer painful to the touch and the coloration had gone , 10 months later it no longer hurt to run . It does take a while , I would wait as long as you can to decide to get it drained , because I was told this can be painful . But if there 's absolutely no change in color or size after 7 months , you may want to go for it , cause that 's about when the calcification process starts ( Eventually it will turn hard . ) Healing time also depends on where the hematoma is located . If there is mostly bone and not alot of muscle mass , it may not take as long ( i.e . top of foot , hand , etc . ) In areas with much muscle mass and fat , it may take a long time , because the muscle absorbs all the protein.Here 's what you can do to hurry it a little : Fill a styrofoam cup with water and freeze.Tear the top rim off so a half inch or so protrudes like chapstick.Massage the hematoma lightly with this ice for 15 minutes at a time , 3 to 4 times daily.At night , use some form of localized heat , that can be comfortable and not dangerous or painfull . This will help promote bloodflow in that area.DO N'T rub or massage the area , you may make the area bleed again under the skin , starting you back at day 1.Eat a diet rich in protein.Get extra rest if the hematoma is on your legs or feet.Good luck , I hope this helps you .",0

"Is it official Roman Catholic doctrine that unbaptized babies do not enter Heaven ? What is the belief re : the fate of non-believers ? Children who have died without Baptism , can only be entrusted to the mercy of God . Indeed , the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved , and Jesus ' tenderness toward children which caused him to say : `` Let the children come to me , do not hinder them , '' allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without Baptism . All the more urgent is the Church 's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism . a baby is a person created by God and a baby who 's died did have a soul . God , if He is truly the God of love every Christian believes he is , would never forsake one who can not argue for themselves . St. Therese once said `` Knowing the loving God that I know , I believe hell is empty '' By the way , what I 've mentioned above is actually Catholic Doctrine .

"do u people think ice age will come back agein ? I have an MS in paleoclimatology , and I have to say that it is one of the most fascinating topics Ive ever delved into . It 's also amusing to see non-scientist 's responses here and on other message boards ! If you wanted to ask a scientist , you would have to define what you mean when you say `` ice age . '' There are varying degrees of `` ice ages . '' For brevity sake , I will assume you mean the relatively cold periods that last approximately 100,000 years that have dominated global climate for the last 2 million years . Contrary to popular belief , there are periods during the `` ice ages '' that are almost as warm as today.Based on paleoclimate evidence that suggest the ice ages have come and gone at least six times in the last 2 million years , the probability is that it will occur again.The difficult and possibly dramatic question is : when ? Seeing as though the last `` ice age '' generally ended about 12,000 years ago ( this is debatable , since there is no one date where everywhere across the globe it suddenly became warm ) , and the average interglacial is 10,000 years , we are overdue.Consider the widely accepted hypothesis that `` global warming '' -- whether it be natural , human-induced , or a combination -- can ultimately ( Ill spare you the details ) lead to an ice age . Melting polar sea ice , indicator species dying off in the tropics , large disintigrations of ice shelves in the Antarctic , estimations that global sea level may rise 4 inches in the next 100 years , `` wild '' weather in many parts of the US ... are these all tell-tale signs that we have already begun down the road to the next glacial period ? ! ? ! ?

"Does anyone know anything about Linus Pauling any written work ? ? ? Pauling , Linus Carl ( 1901-1994 ) , American chemist and physicist , whose investigations into the structure of molecules led to discoveries of how chemicals bond.Pauling was born in Portland , Oregon , on February 28 , 1901 , and educated at Oregon State College and the California Institute of Technology . He began to apply his insights into quantum physics as Professor of Chemistry at the institute , where from 1927 to 1964 he made many of his discoveries . By devising techniques such as X-ray and electron diffraction , he was able to calculate interatomic distances and the angles between chemical bonds.During the 1930s Pauling introduced concepts that helped reveal the bonding forces of molecules . The Nature of the Chemical Bond , the result of these investigations , has been a major influence on scientific thinking since it was published in 1939 . Pauling also investigated the atomic structure of proteins , including haemoglobin , and discovered that cell deformity in sickle-cell anaemia is caused by a genetic defect that influences the production of haemoglobin . He was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work . In later years Pauling fought ardently against nuclear weapons testing , warning the public of the biological dangers of radioactive fallout , and presented a petition to the United Nations in 1958 signed by over 11,000 other scientists . In 1962 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , becoming the second person , after Marie Curie , to win two Nobel Prizes.Throughout his scientific career , Pauling followed his creative hunches , no matter how controversial they were . In 1970 , for example , he advocated large doses of vitamin C to treat the common cold—a belief , however , that few medical authorities have endorsed .",0

"how do I date a woman and make her feel confortable with me ? As to how you date , it depends on your culture . In the US , you ask her to go to dinner and a movie . Meet her parents , make polite conversation for 5 - 10 minutes , tell them when you will be home.Feeling comfortable is a matter of not pushing . Do n't try to [ hold hands / kiss / have sex ] on the first night , for instance , again depending on your culture . Ask her about her interests instead of talking about yours.Depending on your age and experience , she will probably be as nervous or not nervous as you . Two 16-year olds are ALWAYS nervous . A 40-year old divorced man and a 40-year old widow should be less nervous ; they have seen more of life . If you are a 40-year old divorced man dating a 16-year old , you should not ; pick someone within 5 years of your own age .",0

"Is Congenital heart disease sex linked ? Your question is heard to understand . Is it Sex linked ... as in whether it is male or female linked ? Nothing I have read would say that is is found nmore in one sex than another.Congenital means inborn or existing at birth . This is what I found on the site noted in the sources below : '' What causes congenital cardiovascular defects ? Congenital cardiovascular defects are present in about 1 percent of live births . They 're the most common congenital malformations in newborns . In most cases scientists do n't know why they occur . Sometimes a viral infection causes serious problems . German measles ( rubella ) is an example . If a woman contracts German measles while pregnant , it can interfere with how her baby 's heart develops or produce other malformations . Other viral diseases also may cause congenital defects.Heredity sometimes plays a role in congenital cardiovascular defects . More than one child in a family may have a congenital cardiovascular defect , but this rarely occurs . Certain conditions affecting multiple organs , such as Down 's syndrome , can involve the heart , too . Some prescription drugs and over-the-counter medicines , as well as alcohol and `` street '' drugs , may increase the risk of having a baby with a heart defect . Researchers are studying other factors . ''",0

"How can we show the world that President Bush does'nt represent the american people. ? I Wont say that the president is doing a bad job , because I dont understand the reasons why he does the things he does , and I hav'nt studied the issues he is dealing with , but I cant feel good about starting a war in Iraq , bombing Pakistan when we 're not at war with them , violating our civil rights , the temporary concentration camp in the superdome after katrina ... etc . But I worry about what people in other countries think about Americans when he speaks for us with that dumb redneck voice . He was not elected by the majority of Americans . We chose Al Gore . The supreme court appointed him president . In the 2004 election he did'nt win any primary elections . The repulicans did'nt let anyone challenge him . They made believe they were democrats and voted for Kerry , and the democrats were saddled with an unelectable candidate . Then they put a gay marrige thing on the ballot so people would go to the polls to vote against that , and voted for the more anti gay candidate while they were there . In the 2000 election Gore won the popular vote , i.e . the majority voted for gore . In other countries you win if the majority votes for you . The foreigners dont believe that story about how Bush won because he got more of something called an electoral vote , especially since it happened in a state run by his brother . The election in Florida was done by computer , and everyone knows that a really good hacker can get into a computer and make it malfunction , so you know when theres something fishy going on with a computer , a hacker has made it past the firewall . Streamcat did'nt say concentration camp , he said temporary concentration camp , its a metaphor . People who the authorities considered inferior were locked up in a place where living conditions were a nightmare so they might think that New Orleans was a place they would not want to come back to after they became refugees .

A syndrome of mental depression and suicidal tendencies , in which the patient complains of having lost everything : possessions , part of or entire body , often believing that he or she has died and is a walking corpse .

"What are some good ways to stop smoking cigarettes. ? Methods of quittingCold Turkey methodNicotine Replacement Methods ( Patch , Gum , Nasal Spray ) Behavioral MethodsCognitive Therapy MethodOther Methods and adjuncts ( acupuncture , hypnosis , medications ) Factors for relapse while in the process of quittingPredictors of successful quittingCold turkey methodThis is the prefered method used by so called self changers , people who quit on their own and without any nicotine replacement by gum , patch or nasal spray . Little is known about this method as any research study would influence the results as it would no longer be a spontaneous process . Strong motivational factors are believed to play the foremost role in successful quitting using this method.Nicotine replacement therapyIn this method the nicotine delivered by the cigarette is replaced with nicotine delivered through the skin ( transdermal nicotine or nicotine patch ) , the nasal mucosa ( nicotine nasal spray ) or the buccal mucosa ( nicotine chewing gum ) . Several well designed clinical trials have shown the efficacy and safety of nicotine replacement the goal of which is to reduce cravings and ease withdrawal symptoms . Transdermal Nicotine Patches The nicotine patch is usually well tolerated , and provides constant , steady nicotine blood levels throughout the day and night when worn . They are quite simple to use , help prevent weight gain , cravings , and nicotine withdrawal symptoms and are socially acceptable Side Effects of the patch Patches may cause a local skin reaction , and insomnia with nightmares may occur . Overdosing in nicotine is possible , especially if a person smokes while wearing the patch . Smoking while wearing a patch is dangerous and may lead to stroke or heart attack . Use of the patch requires abstinence from tobacco products ... i.e . no smoking or chewing tobacco . Cost Patches are expensive and cost close to $ 100 per month of use . However bear in mind that smoking 1 ppd costs $ 1000 per year , which multipied by 10 years approximates the price of a car . Some people are tempted to cut the patch to save money . Nicoderm is the only patch that can be cut without destroying the patch 's ability to deliver nicotine through the skin to the bloodstream reliably.. It is not unsafe to cut the other patches as far as I know . However cutting the other patches impairs the transdermal drug delivery system , and may not provide reliable blood levels of nicotine . the key word here is reliable . The total dose of nicotine in the patch does not correlate at a milligram to milligram equivalency to the dose delivered to the bloodstream . The drug delivery system of the patch ensures that nicotine is transported thru the skin at a constant rate , and e ach manufacturer uses a different patented technology to do this . Only a portion of the total nicotine contained in the patch is transported thru the skin . Individual differences in skin thickness , location of the applied patch , and other related factors play a role in the total dose delivered . 3 Step Tapering Method of using the patch o The 21 mg patch is worn daily for 6-8 weeks for quitters who smoked an average of 1 ppd ( 2 ppd quitters may require 2 patches to alleviate cravings and withdrawal symptoms ) o The 14 mg patch is then worn daily for the next 2 to 4 weeks if the ex smoker remains confident in his or her ability to not smoke and if urges or cravings to smoke are controlled . o The 7 mg patch is then worn for 2-4 weeks if the same criteria as above are met . o In the absence of cravings and urge to smoke the patch is then stopped entirely . It is important to individualize the tapering method . . . Some people require longer periods of use , others shorter . If cravings intensify , return to the next higher dose of the patch . Types of nicotine patches Nicotrol 15,10,5 mg 16 hour patches",0

From wikipedia : '' In the United States , Denmark and Sweden , an apple ( polished ) is a traditional gift for a teacher .

As apples were a very common crop , teachers would often be given baskets of apples by students . As wages increased , the quantity of apples was toned down to a single fruit . `` So I guess it was so common that it become a symbol for teaching and learning .",0

"what is the best indoor cycling trainer ? I am looking at a fluid trainer , a CycleOps Fluid2 , or a Mag trainer , but do n't know the real difference between the two . I 'd like to get some comment or opinions ob various brands out there as well . I went through this exercise last winter , and actually decided to go with Kreitler Dyno-Lyte rollers . The reason is that rollers require you to learn balance . Having better balance makes you a more fluid cyclist , a better bike handler , and you 'll be able to ride a line as straight as anyone . Plus , it 's not nearly as boring as being tethered by your back wheel ! My general feeling is that I felt like a trainer would make me lazier overall , even if I were gaining strength.The only downside for me is that rollers will wear out your back tire by the end of winter . Hardly an issue though , because the road would do the same .",0

"should cancer suffers be given herceptin regardless of the cost ? HUNDREDS OF WOMEN HAVE AN AGGRESSIVE FORM OF BREAST CANCER AND MANY OF THOSE HAVE HAD THE COSTLY DRUG PAID BY THEIR LOCAL NHS IN FEAR OF BEING SUED AND SOME HAVE LOST THEIR LEGAL BATTLE . sHOULD THE GOVERNEMENT SHELL OUT FOR ALL SUFFERES TO BE GIVEN THE 'WONDER ' DRUG You must be in the UK , as you mention NHS . A colleague of mine who is an SHO ( senior house officer=resident ) there , tells me there 's lot 's of waste in that system . If women with HER-2/NEU positive breast cancer ( which as you mention are a small percentage ) were to receive the drug free of charge , I do n't think it would break your system . From what I hear the NHS ( British National Health Service ) has more problems than giving away expensive drugs . The system probably wastes more money with unnecessary ambulance rides per year than herceptin . But of course this is just heresay on my part . Universal health care is great , however , like everything there need to be checks and balances . The bottom line is poor patients should receive the same standard of care as the wealthy patient . People who cry about paying higher taxes probably would n't even notice the difference . Our military ( in which I was a former member USMC ) wastes more money per hour than this drug would cost us in a year .",0

"How faithful is the modern Bible to the original texts ? Please give me real information , not dogma. ? Great question . Depends on what you mean by `` modern '' ? The original Biblical text was written in mostly classical Hebrew ( the OT ) , with some Aramaic ; and Koine Greek for the NT , also with some Aramaic in there.None of the original manuscripts have survived , BUT , we have some NT Gospel fragments that are within decades of the originals . Our oldest copies of Hebrew manuscripts are witin hundreds of years from the originals.That said , the textual evidence and support for the Bible surpasses in other ancient `` literature '' by far.Now , to the issue of which modern version is best . The answer to that could take pages to answer depending on all kinds of things related to textual criticism.For me , I know Greek and Hebrew , I really like these two modern versions best in terms of their reliability and faithfulness to the original languages.1 .

"Does water evaporate faster in a warm room or a cool room ? 5th grade science project . We put equal aomounts of water in three plastic cups . One cup was put by a heat vent , another cup was put in the basement near a door and the third cup was put in the living room.The cups in the basement and the living room are evaporating at the same rate . The cup near the vent is evaporating faster . Why are the cups in the the basement and living evaporating and the same rate ? Why is the cup near the vent evaporating faster ? It 's to do with humidity of the air . If you watch the weather report you may notice that humidity is expressed as a percentage . This is how 'full ' the air is with water vapour . If the air is nearly empty ( low humidity ) then water will evaporate more quickly . If the air is full ( high humidity ) the water will evaporate more slowly ( it may even receive more water from the air ! ) .Here is the key : hot air can hold MORE water than cold air . So even if say a gallon of water is the most that some amount of air can hold , if you the air up the air will no longer be 'full ' ( for example it might be only 70 % full , hence 70 % humidity ) .This is not a complete answer as I do not know everything about it . It 's pretty advanced for 5th grade ( I learnt about it in the 11th grade ! ) . For more information look up EQUILIBRIUM in chemistry .",0

These produce proteinases and lipases which break down both the protein and the fat in milk , causing rancid and bitter tastes and clotting .

"What is your weight in Kg ? Is it normal to your height ? Human height , or stature , is the height of a human being . Height generally varies little between people compared to other anthropometric measures , usually exceptional height ( variance from the average of around 20 % ) is due to gigantism or dwarfism , but height normally falls within a certain range known as a normal distribution ( bell curve ) . Height is determined by the interaction of genes and environment . Final adult height may be attained anywhere from the early teens to early 20s , though it is most commonly reached during the mid teens for females and late teens for males.MY HEIGHT 165CMS WEIGHT 65 KGS",0

Why does the same side of the moon always face us ? Our moon is locked in what is known as a geo-synchronous orbit . For millions of years the angular momentum has stablized the moon to provide very little loss of energy between earth and moon . This does not account for the influences that the moon has upon our oceans though . ( Tides ) Our solar system has `` moved about '' for many millions of years to allow for efficient energy transfers between baryonic masses .

"what is the begining of israel and palastine conflict ? why could n't it be stopped ? Complex problems usually do n't have simple answers ( like 'they tried to throw the Palestinians out ) .For over 3,000 years , Jews have held the Land of Israel to be their homeland , both as a Holy Land and as a Promised Land . The Land of Israel holds a special place in Jewish religious obligations , encompassing Judaism 's most important sites — including the remains of the First and Second Temple , as well as the rites concerning those temples . [ 2 ] Starting around 1200 BCE , a series of Jewish kingdoms and states existed intermittently in the region for over a millennium . Recent archeological evidence suggests that the kingdoms of King David and King Solomon may have existed . [ 3 ] Under Babylonian , Greek , Roman , Byzantine , and ( briefly ) Sassanian rule , Jewish presence in the province dwindled due to mass expulsions . In particular , the failure of the Bar Kochba Revolt against the Roman Empire resulted in widescale expulsion of Jews . It was during this time that the Romans gave the name Syria Palaestina to the geographic area , in an attempt to erase Jewish ties to the land . The Mishnah and Jerusalem Talmud , two of Judaism 's most important religious texts , were composed in the region during this period . The Arabs conquered the land from the Eastern Roman Empire in 638 CE . The area was ruled by various Arab states ( interrupted by the rule of the Crusaders ) before becoming part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517.Throughout the centuries , the size of the Jewish population in the land fluctuated widely . Circa 1881 , in the region approximating present-day Israel , the Jewish population numbered approximately 20–25,000 of a total population of 470,000 . [ citation needed ] Since 1844 , in Jerusalem the Jews have constituted the largest of several ethno-religious groups . [ citation needed ] By 1896 , they were an absolute majority of the populationThe rise of Nazism in 1933 led to a fifth wave of Aliyah . The Jews in the region increased from 11 % of the population in 1922 to 30 % by 1940 . The subsequent Holocaust in Europe led to additional immigration from other parts of Europe . By the end of World War II , the number of Jews in Palestine was approximately 600,000.In 1939 , the British abandoned the idea of a Jewish national home , and abandoned partition and negotiations in favour of the White Paper of 1939 , which limited Jewish immigration and restricted purchase of land by Jews . Its other stated policy was to establish a system under which both Jews and Arabs were to share one government . The plan was never fully implemented because of a combination of resistance from the Jews and Arabs and Britain 's pre-occupation with Europe and World War II . However , the White Paper guided British policy until the end of the term of their Mandate . As a result , many Jews fleeing to Palestine to avoid Nazi persecution and the holocaust were intercepted and returned to Europe . Two specific examples of this policy involved the ships Struma and Exodus [ 4 ] . These attempts by Jews to circumvent the blockade and flee Europe became known as Aliya Beth.In 1947 , following increasing levels of violence by militant groups together with unsuccessful efforts to reconcile the Jewish and Arab populations , the British government decided to withdraw from the Palestine Mandate . The UN General Assembly approved the 1947 UN Partition Plan dividing the territory into two states , Jewish and Arab , giving about half the land area to each state . Jerusalem was planned to be an international region administered by the UN to avoid conflict over its status.Immediately following the adoption of the Partition Plan by the UN General Assembly ( on November 29 , 1947 ) , the Arab leadership rejected the plan and launched a guerilla war that included attacks on Jewish civilians . The Irgun Tsvai Leumi retaliated with attacks on Arabs , including Arab civilians.On May 14 , 1948 , before the expiry of the British Mandate of Palestine at midnight of May 15 , 1948 ,",0

"What should I eat or not eat to help prevent a herpes outbreak ? Lysine is one of numerous amino acids that the body needs for growth and tissue repair . It is classified as one of the nine `` essential '' amino acids because you need to get it from outside sources such as foods or supplements -- in other words the body ca n't make it on its own . Researchers are exploring the value of lysine supplementation and the consumption of lysine-rich foods for lowering cholesterol , improving athletic performance , and enhancing recovery after surgery.Some nutritionally oriented physicians and dentists recommend taking lysine during an outbreak of canker sores to speed healing . The exact cause of these tiny but quite painful mouth ulcers is unclear , but most research indicates that a virus is responsible . However , there have been almost no clinical trials using lysine as a remedy for canker sores.The most promising application of lysine is its use in managing and preventing painful and unsightly herpes sores caused by the herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) .Specifically , lysine may help to : # Prevent and relieve cold sores ( herpes ) . Exciting research over the past several decades suggests that lysine may be helpful in controlling herpes simplex-related infections . There are two types of this virus : type 1 , which typically causes cold sores or fever blisters around the mouth , and type 2 , which tends to cause genital sores . However , both forms can cause eruptions around the mouth or on the genitals . Once infected with the virus , you have it permanently . It may lie dormant , but it does n't go away . Outbreaks are usually painful and unsightly , as well as contagious.A few years ago , researchers discovered that in order to grow ( replicate ) , the herpes virus needs arginine , another common amino acid . ( Foods high in arginine include chocolate , peanuts , almonds , seeds , cereal grains , gelatin , and raisins . ) Lysine competes with arginine for absorption and entry into tissue cells . And when lysine is present , it inhibits the growth of HSV by knocking out arginine.This makes a diet high in lysine and low in arginine a useful tool in managing HSV infections . In a recent study , participants consumed large amounts of lysine ( about 1 gram three times each day ) while restricting food sources of arginine . A significant number of participants ( 74 % ) noticed an improvement in their HSV infections and a decrease in the number of outbreaks.-As a side note , broccoli is also one of the better vegetable to help your body in keeping outbreaks at bay .",0

FAMILY BACKGROUND : The youngest of three children , Rachel Carson had a rugged upbringing in a simple farmhouse outside the western Pennsylvania river town of Springdale . She credited her mother with introducing her to the world of nature that became her lifelong passion . DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS : After completing her education , Carson joined the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries as the writer of a radio show entitled `` Romance Under the Waters , '' in which she was able to explore life under the seas and bring it to listeners . In 1936 , after being the first woman to take and pass the civil service test , the Bureau of Fisheries hired her as a full-time junior biologist , and over the next 15 years , she rose in the ranks until she was the chief editor of all publications for the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service . During the 1940s , Carson began to write books on her observations of life under the sea , a world as yet unknown to the majority of people . She resigned from her government position in 1952 in order to devote all her time to writing . The idea for her most famous book , Silent Spring , emerged , and she began writing it in 1957 . It was published in 1962 , and influenced President Kennedy , who had read it , to call for testing of the chemicals mentioned in the book . Carson has been called the mother of the modern environmental movement .

"Does anyone know who William Tyndale was ? Info from Wikipedia : William Tyndale ( sometimes spelled Tindale ) ( ca.1484 - October 6 , 1536 ) was a 16th century priest and scholar who translated the Bible into the Early Modern English of his day . Although numerous partial and complete English translations had been made from the 7th century onward , Tyndale 's was the first to take advantage of the new medium of print , which allowed for its wide distribution . Later , in October 1536 , he was killed by strangulation and then burned at the stake.Much of Tyndale 's works eventually found its way to the King James Version , which , though the work of 54 independent scholars , is based primarily on Tyndale 's translations.For more information follow this link : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tyndale",0
"How old is water ? How old is the water on earth ? Is it all the same age ? how did it get here ? That 's a good question . 'Our ' water is not quite as old as the Earth . Volcanic activity in the early formation of the planet was necessary for the release of H20 into the atmosphere ( in the form of steam ) and liquid water only appeared when the planet had cooled enough for that steam to condense.Volcanic eruptions continue to release trapped volatiles including H20 , so technically you might say that some water is younger than the rest.As for how else it might have got here , I found a theory that water arrived in 'snow comets ' ( make of that what you will ! ) see http : //www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0103/05smallcomet/ )",0
"What is the best way to get better abdominal muscles ? First and foremost , stay away from any ab machine.For the upper abs , focus on crunches which effectively work the abdominals better than sit-ups or any machine on the market.For the lower abs , keep in mind there is very little muscle tissue there so decreasing levels of body fat is the most effective way to bring out the best in this area . Hanging leg raises , v-situps and reverse curls are among some of the best exercise for this region . Always make sure your pelvis curls up to maximize lower abdominal contraction during these exercises.As far as fat loss and getting ripped goes , cardio , cardio , cardio .

"Is it posible by using electromagnetic fields to make something invisible ? Well an experiment about this has been done before.. but I would like to know how does it actually work ... I hope you do n't take this to be something of a cop-out answer . Light is itself an electromagnetic field that is carrying energy through space -- commonly called an electromagnetic wave or 'light ' . It is this wave that really makes things visible.Conversely , if you have no electromagnetic wave or one of an invisible wavelength , ( at least to the human eye ) then it wo n't bounce off of the object or if it does it wo n't be visible when it reaches you.The visible properties of an object are determined by how EM waves interact with the electrons near the surface of an object . These interactions are what make shiny things shiny ( for instance ) .",0

"If the core of a nuclear plant went critical ( china syndrome ) would it actually melt it 's way to china ? This is prob a stupid question , I just saw the movie and I missed the explanation of the result of a china syndrome . All nuclear plants that are producing power must be `` critical . '' The plant is shut down when it is `` subcritical . '' A nuclear accident can occur if the reactor goes `` supercritical . '' A supercritical plant can release uncontrolled heat drying the core and melting it . A melted core would fall by gravity toward the center of the world ( like anything else that falls ) . Since Canton OH was almost directly opposite Canton China on the globe , the core would fall toward China , thus the China syndrome . Of course the core would have to melt its way past the plant barriers but would not release enough energy to reach China let alone deeply penetrate the earth . For those with a wild imagination , China would also be protected by the massive molten layer in the center of the earth that surrounds the extremely hard metal core . None-the-less , China Syndrome is a catchy phrase .",0

"who is the president of armenia ? Robert Kocharian ( Armenian : Ռոբերտ Քոչարյան ) ( born August 31 , 1954 ) is the second president of the third republic of Armenia.Kocharian was born in Stepanakert , Nagorno-Karabakh , at that time a region of the Azerbaijan SSR . After becoming president of Nagorno-Karabakh in 1994 , he became Prime Minister of Armenia in 1997 . In April 1998 , he replaced Levon Ter-Petrossian as President of Armenia.He was a Communist Party official during the Soviet era but is no longer a member of any political party . Under Kocharian , Armenia has experienced stability and growth and the emigration rampant under Ter-Petrossian has been reduced . He has also taken a realistic stance in the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.His re-election during 2003 was marred by allegations of electoral fraud against both candidates , though most experts contend that any irregularities were not enough to sway the outcome . There were sporadic calls for Kocharian 's resignation in early 2004 with opposition-led demonstrators taking to the streets in support of demands for a referendum of confidence in him.Kocharian and his wife , Bella Kocharian , have three children .",0

"'NASTERDAM ' who is this man ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Born in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in the south of France in December 1503 , Michel de Nostredame was the son of a grain dealer who was also a prosperous home-grown notary . His family was originally Jewish , but had converted to Catholicism during the previous century along with thousands of others , due to increasing official French persecution of Jews , many of whom were the descendants of former refugees from Spain , where they were known as the Marranos . The names of Nostredame 's known forebears seem to reflect this . While practice of the ancestral religion was often apparently continued in secret , nobody knows whether this applied to Nostredame 's family , or whether it still applied to him two generations later . ( It should be noted that the majority of Jews at the time frowned upon such 'cover conversions ' , not least because succeeding generations of offspring were inevitably more at risk to lose connection with their past , and thus with their roots and religion . ) His adult religious leanings suggest , however , that his upbringing was devoutly Catholic.This apart , nothing is known about his childhood , but at the age of fifteen he entered the University of Avignon to study for his baccalaureate . After little more than a year he was forced by the plague to leave again . In 1529 , after some years as an apothecary , he entered the University of Montpellier to study for a doctorate in medicine , but was promptly expelled again when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary , which was a 'manual ' trade expressly banned by the university statutes . He then continued work as an apothecary ( though some of his publishers and correspondents would later call him 'Doctor ' ) , and created a `` rose pill '' that was widely believed to protect against the the plague.In 1531 he was invited by Jules-César Scaliger , a leading Renaissance man , to come to Agen . There Nostradamus married a woman whose name is still in dispute ( possibly Henriette d'Encausse ) , but who bore him two children . In 1534 , however , his wife and children died , presumably from the plague . After their death he continued to travel , passing through France and possibly Italy.He settled down in 1547 in Salon-de-Provence , where he married a rich widow named Anne Ponsarde Gemelle and eventually had six children – three daughters and three sons . After a further visit to Italy , he began to move away from medicine and towards the occult . He wrote an almanac for 1550 , for the first time Latinising his name to 'Nostradamus ' , and was so encouraged by its success that he decided to write one or more annually . Taken together , they are known to have contained at least 6338 prophecies ( most of them , in the event , failed predictions – see Chevignard and Lemesurier ( 2 ) under Sources ) , as well as at least 11 annual calendars , all of them starting on 1st January and not , as is sometimes supposed , in March . He then began his project of writing 1,000 quatrains , which form the supposed prophecies for which he is famous today . Feeling vulnerable to religious fanatics , however , he devised a method of obscuring his meaning by using `` Virgilianised '' syntax , word games and a mixture of languages such as Provençal , Greek , Latin and Italian . For technical reasons connected with their publication in three instalments , the last 58 quatrains of the seventh 'Century ' , or book of 100 verses , did not survive into any extant edition.The quatrains , written in a book titled `` Les Propheties '' , received a mixed reaction when they were published . Some people thought Nostradamus was a servant of evil , a fake , or insane , while many of the elite thought his quatrains were spiritually inspired prophecies . Soon nobility were coming from far and wide to receive horoscopes and advice from him , though he normally expected them to supply the birthcharts on which they were based .

"why is glucose highly reactive in oxygen gas ( at 37 degree celcius ) in the biological systems ? the same mixture of glucose and oxygen gas is stable outside the biological system . does the compex order of the biological system one of the reasons ? Biological systems have enzymes ( and a handful of other reagents ) which will use O2 and sugar to make energy -- specifically , hexokinase ( HK ) , phosphoglucose isomerase ( PGI ) , phosphofructokinase ( PFK ) , aldolase , triose phosphate isomerase ( TIM ) , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) , phosphoglycerate kinase ( PGK ) , phosphoglycerate mutase ( PGM ) , endolase , and pyruvate kinase ( PK ) . The process undergone is called glycolysis . The result is that glucose is consumed , making two pyruvate molecules ( which in some systems can then enter the Citric Acid Cycle aka Kreb 's Cycle ) and ADP is turned into ATP , which is an energy source.And after memorizing this and subsequently forgeting all this useless detail some years ago , I nearly ralphed on my book reading this just now .

"best way to invest money ... risks doesnt matter for me ? It 's been mathematically `` proven '' that you can get high returns AND reduce your risk by buying diverse high-risk investments which have no correllation.Also , Equities ( Stocks ) have had some of the best returns historically , and are still considered a very good investment.Of course you do n't want to be STUPID about it and buy the riskiest stuff possible . Get some AGGRESSIVE mutual funds with low fees ( Vanguard has some ) . Spread your money around to highly aggressive funds that have little correllation . For instance , some Domestic High Growth , some Foreign aggressive growth , maybe some Real Estate Trust Funds , some High Tech , Some Health Care.Look at the historic returns of the sector and the fund . Look too at the risk vs. return . If , as you say , risks do n't matter , then go for high return funds , with a reasonable risk . And spread it around - but make sure you spread it around to different TYPES of investments - all that are aggressive , but some that move contrary to each other ( like foreign vs domestic , or REITs vs Stock )",0

"What problems do adolescents face in reading Shakespeare at school ? 1 .

The language is difficult , and most competing forms of entertainment require far less work.3 . If you notice how many of the questions here are written , you will notice that the chat room / e-mail / text messaging generation does not seem to relate to the written word in the same way that old folks like me do.4 . High school teachers are n't always well equipped to teach Shakespeare . All that aside , I have been amazed at how some adolescents absolutely love Shakespeare , despite all of those disadvantages .",0

"is carbohydrates good for building muscles ? well my friend IMHO I can answer you that pretty well . Carbs are the fuel for your muscle when you work out . The best carbs during the day are complex carbs like sweet potato and oatmeals , and veggies . When you are about to workout , during workout and right after finishing your training are simple carbs with fast digesting protein . Best bet is a combination ( 50:50 of glucose and dextrose ) and whey protein . If you really want to educate your self in proper nutrition for building muscle I recommend you google John Berardi website and www.burnthefat.com you will learn a lot and with time , will power and patience you will achieve an awesome body like I have done .

What is the difference between a savings account and a money market account ? Money Market accounts typically offer a much higher rate of return than savings accounts .

They also adjust to the current interest rate much faster than savings accounts which typically move like molasses on a winter day .,0

"Why do some states still have barbaric ways and have the death penilty and others do n't ? I notice that there is still legallized murder in some states and none in others . How can a civillized government allow this to happen in any states ? The short answer is that we live in a Democracy and death penalty laws are on the books because people ( or their representatives ) put them there . There are usually four distinct groups of people involved and it cuts across party lines . Large groups favor the death penalty and large groups oppose it for any number of good reasons . Small groups who have lost someone to murder believe that the death penalty is `` too good '' for the perpetrator , but are not allowed to take the law into their own hands . Small groups related to the murderer oppose the death penalty because of shame and the fact that they still love the perpetrator and find good excuses for him/her.On top of all that , sensational murders committed by those who expect to escape punishment spur on society to support the death penalty . Crimes against innocent children are particularly heinous . And news that someone convicted of murder has been proven ( by DNA tests ? ) to be innocent show the weaknesses in our judicial system.The question really is not all that simple . In New York state , the results of a close Governors race was likely determined on the death penalty issue . The winner favored the penalty while the incumbent never used it based on personal beliefs . Changing politics will always be involved . Many will always feel that a barbaric murderer should know that he/she might face a barbaric fate . And some feel that might save innocent lives .",0
"How does one become a taxidermist ? I am looking for a career , but I can not and will not learn Algebra . Any suggestions ? IntroductionTaxidermy programs prepare people to create lifelike models of wildlife and fish . Students learn how to select materials from dead animals and how to use artificial resources such as glass , wax , and foam . They study methods to create needed parts and care for models . In addition , they learn to manage a business and advertise their services.OverviewThe Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti once said that `` the object of art is not to reproduce reality , but to create a reality of the same intensity . '' As an art form , taxidermy does exactly this.Contrary to popular belief , taxidermists do not take dead animals and stuff them for display . Although this practice used to exist , most taxidermists would frown upon this mere attempt to `` reproduce reality . '' Instead , taxidermists are artists who re-create `` a reality of the same intensity '' by using a combination of artificial resources and natural materials from animal corpses.If you 've ever been to a museum of natural history or science , you may have seen the work of a taxidermist . You might have seen the form of an antelope 's head mounted on wood or a lifelike representation of a jackrabbit in a setting crafted to look like a forest clearing.As a taxidermist , you help to preserve the memory of animals . Just as other artists do , you pay close attention to details that others might not notice . You look at color , texture , expression , and muscle movement . You combine crafts such as carpentry , woodworking , tanning , and molding and casting to give renewed life to these details . You also use the artistic talent required for drawing , sculpting , and painting.You might show your work at competitions , in shops and museums , or in the private homes of your customers.In taxidermy programs , you learn to build frames and forms to substitute for animal skulls and skeletons . You study the techniques for sculpting clay heads or bodies and finishing models with painting and preservation . You also learn to preserve animal components such as skin , feathers , and fur.Proprietary schools and some community colleges offer taxidermy programs . You can typically earn a certificate which takes anywhere from a few weeks to a year of full-time study after high school . ''",0

"how many merders happen in new york each year ? 270 during last year.Murders were up slightly nationwide during the first six months of the year , and gang violence contributed to more killings in some of the nation 's largest cities , the FBI reported Monday . The number of murders rose 1.1 % nationwide , while overall violent crime declined 3.1 % . New York , Baltimore and Philadelphia were among the cities with an increase in homicides.The reasons for the increase in homicides vary by city . But experts said there has been a resurgence in gang activity in some of the cities . `` The question is , what are they fighting over ? '' said Kenneth Land , a Duke University sociology professor . `` Is it retribution homicides , or turf wars over drugs , or is it protecting turf ? `` The FBI 's six-month status report , based on reports from state and local law enforcement agencies , is widely viewed as an important indicator of national crime trends each year . The report also is considered a good predictor for the bureau 's year-end crime analysis.The report does not include raw totals for categories of crimes , only percentages . However , the FBI had figures for some large cities.The six-month totals for 2003 marked the third consecutive time the FBI has recorded a decrease in overall violent crimes but an increase in murders.The FBI said there were 308 murders from January to June of this year in New York City , compared with 270 during the same span last year . Philadelphia had 158 murders in the first half of this year — 20 more than in the first half of 2002 . Baltimore had 141 ( 14 more ) and Newark , N.J. , had 40 ( 13 more ) .Officials in Washington declared a crime emergency this summer during a spate of mostly gang-related violence.Overall , there were 4.3 % more murders in the Northeast part of the country during the first half of 2003 compared with last year . There also were slightly more homicides in the South and West ; only the Midwest showed a decrease ( -1.9 % ) .Many major cities outside the Northeast had fewer slayings , the report said . Los Angeles was down by 65 ; it had 258 . Detroit had 156 ( 28 fewer ) and Las Vegas dropped by six , from 70 to 64.Even with the national increase in murder , overall violent crime fell , as it has for most of the past decade . Other violent crimes besides murder that are measured are forcible rape , robbery and aggravated assault.Aggravated assaults were down 4.4 % . Forcible rapes dropped 4 % and robberies less than 1 % . Property crimes dropped by 0.8 % compared with the year before , although motor vehicle thefts were up slightly at 0.9 % . Other property crimes are burglary and larceny.The number of arsons — measured separately — dropped 10 % . Every part of the country saw fewer criminal fires set in the first half of 2003.The nation 's largest cities , those with more than 250,000 residents , saw violent crime drop slightly more than 4 % .

"need free advice/help with a resume. ? Look up resume examples online , find the types of `` jobs '' that appeal to you . Then match up what your talents are `` that you make you an asset to that particular position '' and convince the industry of what you have to offer in your resume . Many HR personnel do n't really care what you have done for your own interest in resumes , they are looking for what you have done that will be the best match to the position they are offering.Do some research , once you get a `` job '' with an industries , you can have a better feel for the position that interest you more from the inside of the company.I 'm not saying minimize your education , but you can leave out bits of experience that may not seem like an asset to them . Sometimes less is more . Then build on your qualifications and abilities , to advance to positions you find more interesting.There are auto resume builders available to walk you through how to put it all together in a professional manner , but using the format of resume examples on line should work well.I 'll also say try to keep the pages to a 2 page minimum , after that HR loses interest .",0
"how do i find out what my citizenship is if i 'm an immigrant that was born in a refugee camp ? It depends on the immigration law of the country in which you were born . In the United States , citizenship is determined by two legal concepts , jus sangre and jus solis . The first is based on your parentage , the second on location . If you were born on US soil ( definitions of this can be complex , but it certainly includes all US States , Puerto Rico , etc ) , you acquired US citizenship at the time of birth under jus solis . you can check the source below for more information . If you are abroad , you can contact the local Embassy of Consulate of the nation you are interested in for information . Otherwise , you would normally refer to the local office of your country 's agency for handling citizenship , usually the Ministry of Internal Affairs , Home Ministry or Foreign Ministry.If you were born to at least one parent who was a US citizen at the time of your birth , you may be a US citzen under jus sangre . To determine this , check the source I list below . Your parent will have had to meet certain residency requirements and determination can only be made by factors such as your birthdate , which of parents is a citizen , and how long they may have resided in the US.Disclaimer : taking advice from a person using Bubba as a screen name could be hazardous for your health . It has previously been known to impair judgement and result in unintended consequences and ugly scenes played out late at night in trailer parks .",0
"what is your definition of myoelastic-aerodynamics ? ? ? Myoelastic-aerodynamic TheoryEarly voice researchers in the 1950 's and 1960 's explained vocal fold oscillation with the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory . According to these theories , Bernoulli forces ( negative pressure ) cause the vocal folds to be sucked together , creating a closed airspace below the glottis . Continued air pressure from the lungs builds up underneath the closed folds . Once this pressure becomes high enough , the folds are blown outward , thus opening the glottis and releasing a single 'puff ' of air . The lateral movement of the vocal folds continues until the natural elasticity of the tissue takes over , and the vocal folds move back to their original , closed position . Then , the cycle begins again . Each cycle produces a single small puff of air ; the sound of the human voice is nothing more than tens or hundreds of these small puffs of air being released every second and filtered by the vocal tract . Let 's further examine the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory . Myo- means muscle ; the vocal folds , after all , are mostly comprised of muscle tissue . The -elastic suffix serves to remind us that the vocal fold is elastic and that we have active control over its elastic properties . Aerodynamic means that the theory deals with the motion of air and other gaseous fluids , and with the forces active on bodies in motion ( such as the vocal folds ) in relation to such fluids .",0

Low rung food chain heterotrophs eat autotrophs ( these are herbivores ) and get their calories ( food is a source of chemical potential energy ) from the glucose ( and some other chemicals ) made by autotrophs . Higher level heterotrophs eat the lower level heterotrophs , getting their calories from proteins and fats of the herbivores they are eating . The calories contained in the proteins and fats of the herbivores is derived from the calories of the autotrophs . In essence , the calories from food on this planet are derived from energy from sunlight that plants have converted to chemical form .",0

"HOw do El Ninos warm water 's affect the weather. ? needs to be at least 80 words long okay , now that enough time has gone by to keep you from just copying this onto your homework : ( at least that 's what I read in when you say ..needs to be 80 words.. ) I quote : '' Because El Niño 's warm pool feeds thunderstorms above , it creates increased rainfall across the east-central and eastern Pacific Ocean.In South America , the effects of El Niño are direct and stronger than in North America . An El Niño is associated with warm and very wet summers ( December-February ) along the coasts of northern Peru and Ecuador , causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme . The effects during the months of February , March and April may become critical . Southern Brazil and northern Argentina also experience wetter than normal conditions but mainly during the spring and early summer . Central Chile receives a mild winter with large rainfall , and the Peruvian-Bolivian Altiplano is sometimes exposed to unusual winter snowfall events . Drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the Amazon River Basin , Colombia and Central America.Direct effects of El Niño resulting in drier conditions occur in Indonesia , increasing forest fires , in the Philippines , and northern Australia . Drier than normal conditions are also generally observed in Queensland , inland Victoria , inland New South Wales and eastern Tasmania during June-August.West of the Antarctic Peninsula , the Ross , Bellingshausen , and Amundsen Sea sectors have more sea ice during El Niño . The latter two and the Weddell Sea also become warmer and have higher atmospheric pressure.In North America , typically , winters are warmer than normal in the upper Midwest states and Canada , while central and southern California , northwest Mexico and the southeastern U.S. , are wetter than normal . Summer is wetter in the intermountain regions of the U.S . The Pacific Northwest states , on the other hand , tend to be drier during an El Niño . During a La Niña , by contrast , the Midwestern U.S. tends to be drier than normal . El Niño is also associated with decreased hurricane activity in the Atlantic.Finally , East Africa , including Kenya , Tanzania and the White Nile basin , experiences in the long rains from March to May wetter than normal conditions . There also are drier than normal conditions from December to February in south-central Africa , mainly in Zambia , Zimbabwe , Mozambique and Botswana '' source : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_nino",0

"any one know the reason why people say 'bless you ' after you sneeze ? I do it all the time and have no idea why . THIS IS THE ORIGIN OF THE CUSTOM : In English-speaking countries , it is common for at least one person to say `` Bless you '' after someone sneezes . The traditional explaination for the custom is that it began literally as a blessing . Pope Gregory I the Great ( 540-604 AD ) ascended to the Papacy just in time for the start of the plague in 590 AD ( his successor succumbed to it ) . To combat the plague Gregory ordered litanies , processions and unceasing prayer for God 's intercession . When someone sneezed , they were immediately blessed ( `` God bless you ! '' ) in the hope that they would not subsequently develop the plague.This custom persists among speakers of many languages . Common social responses to sneezes in English include `` Bless you '' and `` Gesundheit '' ( German , `` [ Good ] health [ to you ] '' ) .",0

"MS from canada ? as i have done B Tech in ECE , so i m interested in doing MS from canada university.i want 2 get list of universities that have MS programme and also the fee datails along with full living expenses.i dont know where to start from.plz help me out if u can . You should be more ambitious and aim for a school in the US . There 's this story of this Sri Lankan engineer that lived in Canada for three years and could n't find a job . He had to work as a cab driver.He spent two weeks in America and got three to four jobs offers , without US citizenship ! ! ! Also , there is this story of an engineer from India , I think , that got a PH.D in engineering in Germany , he was a professor at some universities in the United States , and published two books , he emigrated to Canada and he works as ... ... . a CAB DRIVER.There was this other guy who got a bachelor 's degree from Harvard and a PH.D. from Stanford , and he could not find a job in Canada . Their excuse , '' His PH.D. from Stanford was equivalent to Grade 13 '' . They wo n't hire the above three highly qualified individuals because they lack `` Canadian work experience '' . Also , note that it is very hard to get a doctorate in Germany . In fact , Germany is the only country in the world that grades your doctorate . I know because I have experienced both Canada and the United States and trust me , you will find far more opportunity in America than Canada . By the way , if you choose to go for an MS , aim for MIT , Stanford , Caltech , Columbia , or even Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute . America is far more willing than Canada to hire foreign engineers . Also the taxes are lower and your starting salary could range from $ 30,000-80,000 per year . In Canada , a very high percentage of your salary will be taxed . Do n't believe the hype about Canada . THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT FIND YOU A JOB , THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT GET YOU A HOUSE OR THE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY LIKE ADVERTISE IN THEIR PUBLICATIONS . TRUST ME , aim for AMERICA . You will find far more job opportunities .",0
"Why are people so obssesed with Howard Stern ? I admitt , he is entertaining to watch ... but why all the posts/questions about him ? It 's probably because of the huge media attention about Howard leaving terrestrial radio -- you know , traditional AM/FM radio stations -- in favor of satellite programming service Sirius . The deal is an enormous one ( reportedly $ 500 million ) and there is a tremendous amount of attention being paid to the change . His last day on traditional radio was today , and he will launch his satellite programs in about three weeks.Additonally , Howard is one of the greatest self-promoters around . He 's spent the past year since the deal was announced talking about his move , often on his terrestrial network show . It has created a lot of friction and , of course , more attention about Howard and his big move.I do n't know if his fans , or the public in general , are more obsessed with Howard now that he 's making this change . It will allow him to do whatever he wants , as opposed to the obscenity restrictions enforced on broadcast radio by the FCC . I think it 's some of both . While many of his fans ca n't wait for Howard to do literally anything , I think that a lot of hoopla is just all the hype . He 's a national figure getting this huge deal for what is essentially an unknown quantity in Sirius . There have been some real gains in their susbscriptions as they approach the launch , but whether they will bring in enough only time -- and Howard 's popularity -- will tell .",0

"Space Cadets - hoax on us ? I 've heard in various places that the Space Cadets reality TV show on Channel 4 in the UK is actually performed entirely by actors , notably on Radio 1 yesterday morning.The show openly admits there are some actors there , but I find it hard to believe that none of them are genuine . The premise of the show is a group of people are told they are being sent to space , and placed in an incredibly realistic simulator for 5 days . The claims against it state the whole programme is a trick on the viewing public ... any ideas guys ? Find out more about the show at http : //www.Channel4.co.uk/SpaceCadets There was an article by one of the programme producers in The Guardian recently , which included his admission that they planted some people , but also explained the selection criteria for the victims.You could argue the article itself could be part of the hoax on us , but I think a national newspaper would be careful to avoid getting egg on their faces by being sucked into it like that , particularly given the controversy about the programme . In addition , the tone of the article was too convincing to my mind - the sense of the producer 's pride in pulling it off , amusement and mischief rang true .",0

"who is the presedent of canada ? No one . We do not have Presidents ( thank God ) . The official head of state of Canada is the Governor General ( Her Excellency the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean ) , who represents our Queen , Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.The Governor General takes the advice of the Prime Minister who is currently Stephen Harper.To echo a comment that someone made , we do have a very good system of government here . It is based on the Parliament system style of government used in the United Kingdom.The previous government lost a `` vote of confidence '' , and when this happens we normally hold an election . This only happened because we had a minority Liberal government . When the Gomery Report came out , the opposition parties ganged up and voted against the minority government.If you have a majority government , you 're stuck with the government until at most 5 years . But we usually have elections every 4 years.One thing we normally have more open politics here because of the parliamentary style of government . The leader of the opposition maintains a fairly good check on the actions of the ruling government . Our news is mainly revolving around the government and the goings on with politics and not sensational shootings and murder , so we also keep a sharp eye on our politicians.If you 're interested in learning more about my country and our style of government , please visit http : //www.canada.gc.ca/",0

"regicide in Macbeth ? why does macbeth feel more guilty about killing Duncan then he does about the other murders ? Of the people he had killed , King Duncan was the one who had confided in him . His wife , Lady Macbeth , upon hearing the prophecy , was the one that incited for Macbeth to kill King Duncan . This would then lead to him feeling guilt sa he had recieved kindness from a man whom his domineering wife wants dead . He had a choice between friendship and marital relations and he chose to obey his wife than risk her leaving him or something of that sort . Also , King Duncan also praised Macbeth for his greatness in battle . all his wife ever said about him was his cowardice in killing King Duncan . Since he chose to kill King Duncan from his wife 's desires , he lost a person that treated him well to one that treats him like a slave .",0

"in connectiom to my last question , Who gave us the knowlegde to be able to attain this said evolution ? Erin pls answer this one ... . all can answer ... . Thats the problem , we dont have to ask who created the creator because we are told that God just `` is , was , and always will be '' . The arrogance of man to think that we are smart enough to understand everything is our greatest downfall . Ever hear people say that when they think they know everything , they learn that they know very little ? Virtually everything that we know today was once unreasonable to the abilities of our brain . Just like no one knew about gravity until it was discovered and able to be measured . People thought the Earth was flat , and when they were told it was round , it took many years before they realized the person was right . Then they discovered later it was somewhat oval . Just because the most intelligent scientist in the world can not understand supernatural things , dont mean they dont exist . Maybe someday someone will discover a way to `` see '' these things too , so that everyone will have the knowledge . Just because it hasnt happened yet dont mean we are at the end of all learning , and it wont.The fact that we are the only animals on the planet that aspire for greatness , desire things that we dont need , and have learned how to create things ourself is proof that God created us in His image . We dont question why we have the ability to learn and evolve , we just take it for granted.Mankind has in effect became gods , because they forgot and no longer appreciate what created them . They believe as long as they can invent and create new things that now they are gods . This has been prophesied in Revelation . Part of being marked with the mark of the beast is man becoming their own god .",0

"Is it legal for an employer to dock 30 minutes from your pay for being 1 minute late ? It depends on the state you live in , but most places it would be . You usually have to be paid for all the time you work . He could make you not work for 30 minutes , but if you actually work the 30 minutes , you need to be paid . If you tell us what your state , I could give a more detailed answer.Edit : It is definitely illegal . First , Nevada law says , `` An employer shall pay to the employee wages for each hour the employee works . '' Further , it is illegal to `` Pay a lower wage , salary or compensation to an employee than the amount earned by the employee when the work was performed . '' An employer can change the rate you are paid as a way to punish you , but that requires that they notify you in writing `` Not less than 7 days before the employee performs any work at the decreased wage , salary or compensation . '' Finally , the employer can withold amounts for certain reasons like health insurance and such , but for any other reason , the employee has to voluntarily authorize the deduction in writing . Tell your boss all of this and ask for your back wages in writing . If he refuses , talk to a lawyer.Edit2 : I forgot to add that the regulations specifically say `` An employer may not use a blanket authorization that was made in advance by the employee to withhold any amount from the wages due the employee . '' The employee has to sign the authorization each time .",0

"what does `` Library research in action '' mean ? Information literacy is a skill that Librarians pioneered as journals , papers , books all came online . I understand this question as the function a librarian can play in solving any information 'gap ' that clients need resolving . While not content experts , librarians have the skills to locate relevant information to users needs . They do this by utilising such practices as Meta-data , indexing , keyword brainstorming , problem identification , boolean searching , database identification , berry-picking , etc . The returned information can then be `` actioned . ''",0

"Question to Muslim ? Hi , I am like to understand this 2 things : ( I am a freethinker ) 1 . As I my knowladge Muhammad can not read and write ( Sorry If I am wrong ) . So who actually write A-Quran and how long after his death.The fact that Muhammad can not read and write , what actually this mean to Muslim.How Muslim really sure Al-Quran is correct.2 . Why Non Muslim can not enter muslim holy site ( Macca as example ) . What actually this mean ? ? 1 . Mouhammad used to tell his companions every piece of Quran that he recieves and they used to write it . It was not compiled into one book until after his death though . After he Died , The rulers made sure when they compiled the Quran that every verse they got through a trustworthie person and he had to have 2 witnesses that heard the Prophet say that verse.The significance of Mouhammad not being able to read or write , means that he couldnt have been able to come up with such PERFECT words .

DO NOT OVERPAY YOUR WRESTLERS you just starting to get in the business and alot of small feds have gone out of business because they overpay.You have to eat too , start paying about $ 10 a head but depends on how many people attends your show for example : A . 50 to 100 people=0.00 payB . 101 to 125 people=10.00 payC . 126 10 150 people=15.00 payThis is just a basic round example3 .

"MS : what are the drugs , life factors , foods , or whatever that cause MS to speed up and proceed faster ? After reading dozens of articles about what they do not know , what causes Mutiple Sclerosis to speed up , or causes relapses ? Certain life styles ? Foods ? Drugs ? Do any drugs make it speed up or flare up ? What is known ? Sun is bad , does it cause it to speed up too ? NCB Seems like they do n't know much about MS . The cause of progression in MS is unknown . A relapse can occur if you become over-heated , overly stressed , overly fatigued ... or it can just happen . No lifestyles that I 'm aware of make a difference in the progression . No foods , either . Supplements that boost your immune system should be avoided , because MS is a disease caused by an `` over active '' immune stem in the first place . Anything that stimulates your immune system could lead to a new attack or an exacerbation . The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people diagnosed with MS begin treating with the `` ABC '' drugs ( Avonex , Betaseron , or Copaxone ) as soon as possible . While they do not `` cure '' MS , they do slow down the progression of the disease and prolong the progression of disability . I provided a link to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society below , as well as the makers of Copaxone 's website . *Diagnosed May 2005",0

"what are the advantages and disadvantages of using DSP over FPGA ? Programming a DSP is similar to programming any other type of microcontroller , except that it is designed with signal processing in mind . As such it is designed with extra multipliers and pipelines to allow faster signal processing . They also ( some do ) come with software libraries to implemented tested signal processing functions such as the fourier transform , and convolution.An FPGA is exactly what the name suggests : a programmable gate array . You program it as a piece of hardware . The FPGA basically implements look up tables and as such is good for doing complex logic very fast . Using languages such as VHDL and Verilog you can create complex logic structures . Many pre-writen FPGA cores exist that allow you to implement processors , multipliers , video/audio converters , network protocols ... just about anything . So an FPGA is extremely flexible . If you are looking to implement a complex system , then an FPGA is what you want.If you are using signal processing , and are testing an algorithm then a DSP would be best , as reprogramming an FPGA for signal processing tasks isnt as easy as it is for a DSP . You could how ever develop a DSP like FPGA core , but this would require extensive effort ... and unless you understood your algorithm well would waste development time.In the past I have with ease used an FPGA to build a system containing a processor , ethernet , serial ports , and 100s of digital I/Os ... this is exactly what they are suited for.Where as if i were building a digital equaliser for example , a DSP would be best .",0

"I am 21 so why do n't i have regular periods ? Hormonal imbalances . Usually caused by diet . If you are too thin , you may not have enough body fat - it 's actually the cholesterol in your body ( fat ) that is used to make estrogen . Fatter women tend to look `` softer '' or more feminine.Estrogen is used to make the lining of your uterus that you shed every month.But progesterone is used to coagulate the lining so it sheds at a regular time period . It 's released after the egg is released , so it gets higher just before your period . Certain foods can interfere with the balance of estrogen and progesterone . Soy foods are particularly high in estrogen and can throw things off balance . Progesterone is also released from the adrenal glands , which also release cortisol - a stress hormone . Too much stress makes the adrenals concentrate on releasing cortisol and not on progesterone . Again , things get out of balance.Try to eliminate soy products ( and they are everywhere - most `` vegetable oils '' are soy oil ) and see if that helps . Do some deep breathing and meditation to relax and reduce the cortisol levels .",0

Also , there are many office workers in their middle age around 40 yrs old committing suicide . They are also usually very tired and stressed out under a great pressure at work . The trains in Tokyo often stop and delay because of the suicidal accidents . Workers commuting to work just get so depressed and there are ppl who just jump in to the rail while the train is coming . There are more and more help lines that they can call for help and talk to counselars . Like in high school , the school provides students listing of help lines .

Then go to start menu , accessories , system tools , disk defragmenter . It will take a while but it will help your computer speed up . Hope it helps .",0
"Does anyone really believe that there is intelligent life out there ? And do you believe they have visited the earth before ? If so how could they get here , it being so many light years to the nearest star that may have planets ? there is a pretty convincing argument based on statistics , but that depends largely upon the assumptions one makes . it is called the drake equation : Nc = N * fp * ne * fl * fi * fc * fLwhereN represents the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy fp is the fraction of stars that have planets around them ne is the number of planets per star that are capable of sustaining life fl is the fraction of planets in ne where life evolves fi is the fraction of fl where intelligent life evolves fc is the fraction of fi that communicate fL is fraction of the planet 's life during which the communicating civilizations liveandNc represents the number of communicating civilizationsi snagged this from this page : http : //www.activemind.com/Mysterious/Topics/SETI/drake_equation.htmlwhich explains what some reasonable estimates for these values are , and includes a little javascript calculator thingy so you can plug in your own values.if you use their estimates , the final result is that there should be around 1000 civilizations capable of communicating in the galaxy.however a lot of this hinges on the value of fl , which is the fraction of planets capable of supporting life where life actually evolves . since we have no evidence to support any value for this parameter at all , it 's all pretty moot.however , we have only just begun started exploring our own solar system , and there have been possible ( though not conclusive ) signs of life even the next planet over , on mars . only time will tell , i suppose .",0

I have 4 children and I must say the 2'nd and 3'rd are the most spoiled.. the 1'st is mature and pretty much responsible . I think it has alot to do with the situation they are raised up in..",0

"Would you ever want to attend the Super Bowl ? Why or why not ? I most likely would never want to attend the Super Bowl for three reasons . First , the cost . The cost of one Super Bowl ticket is expensive and with the money that I could pay for one Super Bowl ticket , I could purchase a High Definition Television . Second , I would have to deal with a lot of crowds at the event . Although it would be a dream to attend the Major League Baseball All-Star Game but with the Super Bowl , you have to get to the game early and there is going to be more people attending a Super Bowl than a baseball All-Star Game . Finally , it might be more expensive to attend at Super Bowl after you pay for accommodations for about three day and attending all the Super Bowl events that the host city has to offer . If I ever did want to attend the Super Bowl , I would like to see the Super Bowl in Detroit , Atlanta , Chicago , and in Cleveland . Yes if the Redskins were in it .",0
"Is it really worth buying and trying Crest White Strips for whitening teeth ? Yes , and , actually , the Crest White Strips Premium are worth the extra money . For some reason , they do n't make your teeth as sensitive during the whitening process.One thing that you have to keep in mind is that you have to find the time to use the product . You have to keep the strips on for 30 minutes at a time , twice a day . I usually did this before I went to work in the morning , and after I got home , before I went out again . But it 's kindof hard to commit to if you have a really busy schedule.My uncle is an orthodontist and told me that if you have really sensitive teeth , Crest White Strips are still safe to use . Just because they cause pain does n't mean they 're harming you , they 're just making your teeth sensitive during the whitening process.Happy smiles !",0

"i 've seen alot of shoes left on the side of the street , some people say it 's a sign for some thing , what is it ? Some of the reasons for this which I have noted : Thieves drop stuff on the road they do not want and are trying to get rid of , often at night or early morning hours . I have even seen many boxes of very expensive cigars.Dogs play with shoes left outside or in trash.People who are drunk lose shoes.People who are struck by vehicle , sometimes shoe ( s ) come off.Stuff falls out/off vehicles while people are moving.Kids throw things out of cars.Some people throw things out of windows.Sometimes you see brand new boot or shoe , but seldom both left and right.Generally I think it is mostly a sign of carelessness and trashiness . Found in big city/environs much more than elsewhere.In Philadelphia I saw a huge difference between burroughs where there was a fine for littering and those where not.The trashiest city of all my extensive travels is Detroit , hands down the big winner.You can actually see people driving and flinging all fast food remnants and garbage out virtually any day . And lots of beer bottles 11pm -- 2am.So , I think it is trashiness and careless sign . In that regard it also reflects societal deterioration away from the desired norms of responsibility , care and cleanliness.The best solution is more of the latter . But that is also difficult to enforce . Nevertheless , I am for at least a $ 50 fine in urban areas , with an alternative of two days of participation in a clean up team . On second offense , both . On third offense , one month of weekends , same for fourth thru sixth . If someone does not reform after all that , I do not know what to do . Prison is too much a drain on taxpayer .

Turning away from your faith would be the wrong thing to do . It 's not that God is n't listening or answering your prayers . He does listen and he will answer them . God loves you very much , even when no one else seems to . You should try talking to your preacher or someone in your church that you can trust . Tell them how you are feeling .

"How long can a person live with with the full blown aids virus , also can they fight off the flu , common colds ? We do n't really use the term `` full blown AIDS '' anymore . Most often we look at T-cell counts . T-cells are in your blood . They are part of the immune system . They are what identify things that make you sick . HIV attacks T-cells and eventually kills them all off.We also look at something called a `` viral load . '' It simply tells how much of the virus is in your blood.The lower your T-cells are , and the higher your viral load is - the sicker you may become.If a person with AIDS takes their medications they can live a long and healthy life . I have known people with less than 10 T-cells who have been relatively healthy for a few years . There are medications that can prevent other types of infections that affect people with AIDS too.So , how long can you live ? No one really knows . With medications , people with AIDS can live long and healthy lives.For someone with a badly damaged immune system and not recieving medical care - a common cold or the flu can lead to other infections that eventually could kill the person .",0

"Why Muslims do n't condemn the threats of Islamists to kill the danish cartoonists ? Iread today and i was upset that a Pakistani cleric promised bounty on the head of the cartoonist . like living in middle-ages or stone-ages where ppl got bounties on their head because of their opinion . of course there are more than one , but the cleric , as usual as many clerics , is ignorant probably took his information from somewhere : '' He said the mosque and his religious school would give $ 25,000 and a car , while a local jewelers ' association would give another $ 1 million . No representative of the association was available to confirm it had made the offer . `` This is a unanimous decision of by all imams ( prayer leaders ) of Islam that whoever insults the prophet deserves to be killed and whoever will take this insulting man to his end , will get this prize , '' Qureshi said . `` http : //news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060217/ap_on_re_mi_ea/prophet_drawingsWhy do n't you if you muslims do n't condemn such act openly ? if you are non-Muslim , how can we protect those innocent cartoonists ? To answer your original question , it is because Islam will NOT hold their fellow Muslims accountable for their actions.When asked of a Muslim , why doesn ’ t the Islamic majority in the United Nation condemn the thousands of terrorist acts perpetrated by those of your faith ? The answer comes back , “ We can not judge our Muslim brothers . Only Allah can judge them. ” Yet when it comes to judging the infidel , there are no holds barred . Now , let us contrast this attitude with what the Bible teaches.1 Corinthians 5:11-13For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside ? Do you not judge those who are inside ? But those who are outside God judges.This is the polar opposite to Islam . The Bible teaches that the Christian is to judge the actions of other Christians and call them on the carpet if they are doing ANYTHING unbiblical . However , those who are NOT believers , the Christian is to leave alone , that only GOD will judge them.So there is the contrast . If Islam was really concerned about peace , and was a peaceful religion , they would do something to stop these violent people . But do n't hold your breath .",0

Other animals have to be able to at least get around.Brains do n't grow as much as other parts of the body , which is why babies seem to have large heads.The obvious counter-example is birds , where the young are stuck in the nest and depend on their parents for food . However , flight puts a limit on how heavy a bird can be , and so how heavy its brain can be . But flightless birds are a possible candidate.Amphibians and reptiles are cold-blooded , which seems as though it would rule out our sort of intelligence . On the other hand , perhaps an intelligent crocodile would think of slowing down when the temperature drops much as we think of sleep . Remember that a large brain would mean a large egg ( and you have to fit the rest of the body inside the egg as well ) .",0
"What do you think about rebels ? They can be both a positive and negative influence to a culture . It all depends on what side you 're on .

"If your kids do n't behave right is it approiate to spank them or slap them in the face ? It would take a supremely huge effort for me to EVER slap a kid in the face , however , I have to admit that I 've been tested a time or two . Spanking , however ... well , I am a firm believer in `` spare the rod , spoil the child '' . I am a bit older , however , I know that many people do not believe in this today.I will , then , share with you a family situation . I am the oldest of all of the grandkids & we are all now adults . I was spanked when necessary but not , of course , beaten in any way . My cousins , on the other hand , were never spanked or even smacked to save them from doing something stupid or harmful . My cousins , I have to admit , are some of the most spoiled & self-centered adults that I have EVER come across . Only one even approaches what I would consider normal & I think that this is only because she got lucky when she got married ... he makes a fortune & she does n't have to worry about anything other than taking care of their kids & shopping . Still , she 's quickly learning that she ca n't raise her kids the way she was raised . The other two ? All me , me , me ... to the extent that one of them expected her parents to help her finance en-vitro because she could n't have kids on her own . Now she has three that run wild ... while she blames everyone else for having to work so hard to support them.I know this is just my family but , geez , it should be a little snapshot into the adult effects of not spanking your children when they misbehave ... at least it has been for me ...",0

"Why are honey bees appearing outside at night , in the dark and cold ? Today is ( was ) December 23 . For the past week or so , I 've been finding honey bees outside my front door after sunset . I 'm in the Phoenix metro area , so it 's not freezing cold , but cool enough to kill these poor guys . I never see them during the day and I have nothing on or around my door to attract them . I thought bees did n't fly at night , but apparently they do . Anyway , I was out on my front patio until an hour after sunset tonight - no bees . I went out about 3 hours later and there were five bees . I just went out again and there are eight . ( Seven are dead . ) I 've looked at these carefully - they are normal honey bees , not ground-dwellers . Any ideas why ? I 'm mostly just curious , but I 'd also like to eliminate them so I can go out barefoot again ! It is possible these were drones . For bees September through December can be the beginning of a new cycle.I quote : '' The time of day that drones fly in search of a mate depends on many factors , such as the geographic location , day length , and temperature . Drones usually fly from the hive in large numbers between 11 a.m. and 4:30 p.m . Morning or early afternoon flights may last 2 or 3 hours . Later flights are shorter . When out of the hive , drones congregate in `` mating areas , '' which may serve to attract virgin queens . These areas usually are less than 100 feet from the ground and seem to be associated with land terrain . ''",0

"how can you really really lose your baby fat ? i am 180 pds and 5ft3ins taller that is to much weight on me after i had my 4 kids i blew up try tabooWHAT to eat for losing weight• Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables , especially NC ( negative calorie ) food . * Print these lists . They will be your ... `` Bible '' , from now on ! * Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads . Also ognion + garlic . * Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits ( whenever possible , of course ) * If you really want a book , then check this out : The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook ( Win95/98 only ) . Read more about this e-book here.• Eat fish , chicken , beef , pork . ( preferences are in this order ) * If you are a vegetarian , then ignore this ! * Avoid fat meat• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day . Do n't EVER exclude bread from your diet ! • Snacks between meals ( if needed ) : apples , oranges , grepfruits and other NC fruits* Do n't cheat ... NO cookies , chips , candies , brownies etc ! * EVEN if they have `` low fat '' indication ... They might have low fat , yet they can have lots of CALORIES ! ! ! • About rice , potatoes , beans , [ xxx ] nuts , pastry , pasta ... you know ! * Do n't eat too much of those , at least during the first weeks of the diet . I 'm not a low carb addict , but I 've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities , especially when associated with other foods . * If you like them a lot , try and eat them like one meal . A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch ( never dinner ! ) , followed by a nice big apple . These rich starch foods are not good for dinner ! * At dinner time , chose mainly large mixed veggies salads ... with fish , lean meat or cheese ( if you are not a vegetarian ) . if u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it . no salt no nothing just plain . u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound . i heard that from a weight loss tape . the best drink is water or gatorade . thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo . if u want a macine . run with dumbells on a treadmill . u could do the rocky workout . but thats a new story . u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs1 ) It is not just the amount you eat , but what you eat . Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start . And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.2 ) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day . Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored . The other half of the time use weights , or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle `` burn '' . A gym is also an option , but I do n't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.3 ) Sleep well . To bed earlier and up earlier . Exercise in the morning when you wake up , not in the evening before bed . 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.4 ) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time . A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.That is a good place to start ... if you see good results , keep it up and modify to fit you ... if it does not , see a doctor AND a trainer Keep working out , drink water a lot , eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities , vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice , fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours , minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important , your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hoursthe most important thing is you do n't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you wantyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.comgood luck",0

"When people talk about their `` relationship '' with Jesus , what exactly do they mean ? By characterizing one 's faith in Christ as having a relationship with him , a person implies that that there is an ongoing dialog of sorts ( perhaps non-verbal ) between the believer and the Lord.I mean , if you 've been touched in some way by Jesus once in your life , would n't it be more accurately characterized as an encounter , or an introduction ? Perhaps even an acquaintance ? I recently went to a Starbucks in an unfamiliar town . I paid the girl behind the counter $ 1.70 for my cup of coffee , and left . I do n't believe I will ever see her again . Does that mean I have a `` relationship '' as well ? And if you 've maintained ongoing contact with Jesus , then certainly , you would have sufficient personal experience with your savior to no longer characterize your beliefs as `` faith . '' After all this contact with the Lord , should n't you regard it as `` fact ? `` Just wondering ... It is okay if you think I am nuts but here goes.I talk to God by prayer , sometimes silently and sometimes outloud . God talks to me occassionaly at His time frame , In other words I do n't have to be in a prayerful or spiritual mood for Him to speak . I can not explain it but when He speaks to me , it is not silent in my head and it is not audible so that others can hear it but it is clearly audible to me.So yes , I have a relationship with Him . I also can feel His prescense in my life.Look to John 8:47 , & 10:26-30 Jesus stated my sheep hear my voice and they know me ( Jesus ) and follow me . God may not communicate with everyone the same as He does with me but if you do not hear His voice in some manner then you do n't know Him . My relationship with Him indeed started out as faith but you are correct in the change that takes place . I can not prove this relationship to anyone but to me it is fact . You can not achieve fact without first having faith .",0

"What states have no law requiring breaks for workers ? What states , other than Virginia , have no law requiring employers to give rest or meal breaks in an eight-hour workday ? Few states require lunch or rest breaks , if any . I know that for most employees over the age of 18 in even more politically liberal states like New Jersey do not require rest breaks . Of course , many states regulate such for minors , but few for workers over the age of 18.I 've included a link to a Department of Labor chart that gives requirements for each state on meal breaks . It 's a pretty short list : California , Colorado , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Kentucky , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Nebraska , Nevada , New Hampshire , New York , North Dakota , Oregon , Rhode Island , Tennessee , Washington , and West Virginia.For rest breaks , the list shrinks to California , Colorad , Kentucky , Minnesota , Nevada , Oregon , and Washington.Perhaps few regulate is because most employers voluntarily give rest breaks to employees to make work more bearable .

"When someone looses a lot of weight , where does all the fat and `` disposed '' weight go ? from what I learned in my anatomy class , when you gain fat cells you never lose them .

"Ladies , how do I ask my wife to dress sexier for me , wear make-up , and stillettos ? My guess is that you 're not talking about a day-to-day thing . What you want is for her to get dressed up and for you two to have crazy monkey sex . Awesome.If you two talk about your sex life , bring it up during one of those conversations . Say `` You know what might be fun to try one time ? `` Do n't try to change the whole of your sex life in a day . A good guideline is that only 1 in 3 sexual encounters with your partner should be `` enhanced '' or `` special '' . If you were to start asking her to dress up like a porn star every time you two made love , she would likely feel less than confident.If you two are open enough , head on over to a strip club . Buy her a lapdance . I went to a club and got one and it was superfun . I left the club thinking it might be fun to dress up like a stripper sometimes . Your wife might get the same ideas.However , if you bring it up and she says something along the lines of `` I 'm not a tawdry whore '' , make it clear that you want her to be beautiful and classy , just like she already is . If she still says no , drop it . The more you pressure her , the more she 'll feel like you do n't like her for who she is.Most women will agree to do something that they 're not entirely into every once in a while for the sake of their partner . Besides , if you respond enthusiastically , she 's more likely to do it again.Good luck !",0

"Why the shape of rainbow is as a semi-circle ? When light is refracted off of droplets of water it enables you to see all the colors that make up white light ( sunlight , even light from bulbs . ) creating what people more commonly refer to as a rainbow . Go outside on a sunny day and spray the waterhose if you have one . If you look very carefully , you can see that the rainbow you created is not just a semi-circle , but a full circle ! The bottom half is harder to see , but it is there . The reason rainbows do n't look like that when we see them outside is because we are too low to the ground to see the rest .",0

Fibroids , which are benign growths in uterus , can cause dysmennorhea . Endometriosis , which is uterine lining -- -- endometrial tissue -- -growing where it do n't belong out in tube or in pelvis , can cause alot of dysmennorhea . Birth control pills may help ease the pain . A gynecologist may be able to help you . Eventually , if you are done having kids , and nothing helps , and you get sick of having painful periods , many women just have a hysterectomy , which takes care of the problem .",0

"where natural digits 0123456789 are coming from ? In mathematics , a natural number is either a positive integer ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... ) or a non-negative integer ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... ) . The former definition is generally used in number theory , while the latter is preferred in set theory and computer science.Natural numbers have two main purposes : they can be used for counting ( `` there are 3 apples on the table '' ) , and they can be used for ordering ( `` this is the 3rd largest city in the country '' ) . The natural numbers developed with some difficulty . The Peano postulates state conditions that any successful definition must satisfy . Certain constructions show that , given set theory , models of the Peano postulates must exist.Peano axiomsThere is a natural number 0 . Every natural number a has a natural number successor , denoted by S ( a ) . There is no natural number whose successor is 0 . Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors : if a ≠ b , then S ( a ) ≠ S ( b ) . If a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every natural number which possesses it , then it is possessed by all natural numbers . ( This postulate ensures that the proof technique of mathematical induction is valid . )",0

"WAt would reduce the resistance of a metal wire ? Increasing its thickness , temperature , or length ? ? Or would it be all of those 3 ? increasing thickness , decreasing temperature , and decreasing length would all reduce the resistance of a metal wire . so the only thing that reduces it by increasing is thickness.a good way to remember this is just to reason it out . if the wire is thicker , current can move more freely and with less resistance then a thinner , more constricted wire . the electrons in the current would have more space to move around . if you increase temperature , it would cause more resistance , because with temperature , comes heat , and heat just makes more resistance . lower temperatures allow the current to move more freely , which is why superconductors work really well at low temperatures . and length , well the longer the wire is , the more the resistance is going to build up along the whole thing ... the electrons are just encountering more resistance because the wire is longer..",0
"do i have to send thank you notes for christmas ? The rule is ... if the giver is in a different house from you , you NEED to send one . Do n't just send a blank one though ! Here is a fabulous guide on what to say : There is a six-point formula to the proper thank-you : Learn it , know it , memorize it – and it will never fail you.1 . Greet the Giver Dear Aunt Sally , That ’ s the easy part , but you ’ d be surprised how many people forget it . Dale Carnegie taught us people love to hear their own names and Direct Marketing is sure we also love to read them in ink . That ’ s right , ink . Blue-black is always the number-one choice , but black will suffice in a pinch . Don ’ t let a whimsical marker color be the most stunning part of your note : instead let the words sing without the amplification of rainbow hues . Even if your handwriting is poor , you must still hand-write your notes . Do not type them or , worse , use a word processor . No excuses.2 . Express Your Gratitude Thank you so much for the slippers.This first paragraph seems like it would be the easiest , but it is actually the most complicated . Beware the just writing trap . You are not ‘ just writing to say ’ as in I am just writing to say ; that ’ s stating the obvious . If the giver is reading , clearly you have already written . Therefore use the present-perfect tense , which essentially means write as if whatever you say is happening in the moment.Also – and this is important – never directly mention money . ‘ Thank you for the hundred bucks ’ could instead be ‘ Thank you for your generosity. ’ All cash denominations become ‘ your generosity ’ or ‘ your kindness. ’ If you feel the giver overspent , the farthest you can go is appreciated : ‘ Your generosity is appreciated , ’ or ‘ It is such an extravagant gift – your kindness is appreciated. ’ If you ’ re writing to thank someone for an intangible ( such as them putting you up at their place while you were in town for the weekend ) , first define what the intangible thing is , and then make the gift sound as attractive as possible . In other words , don ’ t say : ‘ Thanks for letting us crash at your place. ’ Instead say : ‘ Thank you for your hospitality. ’ Don ’ t worry if it sounds too simple ; the point of writing the note is to create a simple expression of a heartfelt sentiment.3 . Discuss Use It gets very chilly here in the winter , so they will get a lot of use when winter comes.Say something nice about the item and how you will use it . Let ’ s say it ’ s something you actually love and use incessantly – then say so : ‘ Ever since I got the slippers I have only taken them off to shower and go to work . I ’ d wear them to the office if I thought I could get away with it. ’ But don ’ t lie , even though some etiquette books may tell you it ’ s okay . After all , there ’ s always a truth that can be extracted . Let ’ s say you hate the slippers . How to say thanks ? Find the one thing about them that ’ s nice and discuss it – but don ’ t get carried away . ‘ They are such a lovely shade of blue ’ works , and is more honest than ‘ These slippers make my heart sing like a choir of angels , ’ which is overkill . If it was a gesture , like letting you stay at their place , you can follow the lines of ‘ It ’ s so nice to make a personal connection while traveling . I really appreciated my time with your family. ’ If the gift was cash , allude to how you will use the money , but do not itemize your planned purchases line by line , instead simply say : ‘ It will be a great help when we purchase our new home/toaster/lava lamp/whatever. ’ You can get arty here , but not flowery . It ’ s a fine line . Small , realistic statements like ‘ I put the flowers on the kitchen table and they are still looking fresh and beautiful after a week , ’ or ‘ I don ’ t know which is more fun , actually using the Cuisinart , or reading recipes and thinking I could do that in the Cuisinart ! ’ Having fun is alright , so have at it.4 .

"Can infinite be a finite measurement ? There are many concepts of infinity , some poetic , some mathematic . In math its a pretty definite concept , poetically its just mind-boggling large . `` If you remove a part from infinity or add a part to infinity , still what remains is infinity '' . So what happens if you have one infinity , and remove bits of it to create another infinitity separated by a small space ? You 'd probably end up with two infinities , which means the concept has to be finite.So as an amount , its indefinite , but as a concept , especially as a singularity in math , has a definite meaning ( measurement was too confusing ) .For example , in trigonometry tan 90° = ∞ , and arctan ∞ = +/- 90° . So while the actual value of ∞ is unknown , the value itself has meaning .",0

"what is cancer ? Simple answer : A cell in the body that has gone out of control causing a disease.Cancer is a class of diseases characterized by uncontrolled division of cells and the ability of these cells to invade other tissues , either by direct growth into adjacent tissue ( invasion ) or by implantation into distant sites ( metastasis ) . This unregulated growth is caused by damage to DNA , resulting in mutations to genes that control cell division . Several mutations may be required to transform a normal cell into a malignant cell . These mutations are often caused by chemicals or physical agents called carcinogens . Some mutations occur spontaneously , or they can be inherited ( germ line mutations . ) Cancer can cause many different symptoms , depending on the site and character of the malignancy and whether there is metastasis . Cancer may be painless . A definitive diagnosis usually requires the histologic examination of tissue by a pathologist . This tissue is obtained by biopsy or surgery . Once diagnosed , cancer is usually treated with surgery , chemotherapy , or radiation.If untreated , cancers may eventually cause death . Cancer is mainly a disease of later years , and is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries . Most cancers can be treated and many cured , especially if treatment begins early . Many forms of cancer are associated with exposure to environmental factors , such as tobacco smoking , alcohol , and certain viruses . Some of these can be avoidable , and public health and vaccination programmes are important on a global scale.Another viewpoint : A general term for about 100 diseases characterized by uncontrolled , abnormal growth of cells . The resulting mass , or tumor , can invade and destroy surrounding normal tissues . Cancer cells from the tumor can spread through the blood or lymph ( the clear fluid that bathes body cells ) to start new cancers in other parts of the body ( metastases ) .",0

"how are babies made ? All mammals , including humans , rely on internal fertilisation through copulation . To deliver the sperm to the female , the male inserts his sexual organ , the penis , into the opening of the vagina , the passage into the female 's other sexual organs . ( This process is a part of copulation . ) Once the male ejaculates , a large number of sperm cells swim toward the ovum.The capacitated spermatozoon and the oocyte meet and interact in the ampulla of the fallopian tube . In mammals , binding of the spermatozoon to the zona pellucida , an extracellular layer surrounding the oocyte , initiates the acrosome reaction . This process releases the enzyme hyaluronidase , which digests the matrix of hyaluronic acid in the vestments surrounding the oocyte . Fusion between the sperm and oocyte plasma membranes follows , allowing the entry of the sperm nucleus , mitochondria , centriole and flagellum into the oocyte . Once the ovum fuses with a single sperm cell , its cell membrane changes , preventing fusion with other sperm.This process ultimately leads to the formation of a diploid cell called a zygote . When the zygote reaches the uterus and implants in the endometrium , the female is said to be pregnant .",0

"How did the advancing technology of weapons affect WWI ? The primary advances were the airplane , submarine , machine gun , tank , and posionous gas . The machine gun made the frontal assault very costly thus trenches were used to protect the soldiers . These trenches were also lived in , which produced rat infestation , constantly wet conditions , and poor sanitation . All of these will contribute to the spread of disease and trench foot which sometimes resulted in amputation and even death . To attack the machine guns the tank was developed and although early models were notoriously unreliable their use in the final months contributed to the Allied victory . Poison gas will kill , cripple , and blind thousands . Airplanes initially used only for scouting will later develop into fighters against other planes and bombers . This will lead to some of the best known participants of the war and the glory of being a pilot ( Red Baron , Rickenbaker ) . Finally the submarine will spread the war to innocents on passenger ships and slow commerce to England and from the United States . More importantly it was the German use of Unrestricted submarine Warfare ( along with the Zimmerman note ) that brought the US into the war . It was the infusion of large numbers of Americans with their aggressive fighting ability that will be the deciding factor in the Allied victory .",0

"A daughter marries a father and her mother marries his son . what 's the relationship between the offsping 's ? ? Wow , weird how many people jump to this being incest and going on about the DNA problems . There is no incest here people ! ! ! Mary Jones marries John smithMarys mom ( betty ) marries John smiths Son ( paul ) No blood ties there at all between the two different sexual unions . The only relationship is through marriage.If both couples have a girl ( for ease lets say sally and jane ) then I think that would make them each others cousin , niece and aunt.Sally would be pauls sister and so the aunt to any offspring of pauls . This also makes any offspring of her brother pauls her niece or nephew ( obviously ) . Jane is marys sister and so the same is true , she will be aunt to any of marys offspring hence we have the relationship Aunt and niece for both children to each other . They are also however the grandchildren of each couple . Jane is the grandchild of Mary and John and sally is the grandchild of Betty and paul and since the only relationship I can think of between grandchildren normally is cousins I think this term applies here as well .",0

Well , unless the couples you know got pregnant thanks to the help of fertility drugs , I 'd say it 's just a coincidence . Twins run in some families .

Also , when a woman gets into her later 30s , twins are more common . The chances of having twins also goes up if you 've had children before.Sounds like your friends are going to have enough kids to form their own football league ! : )",0

"what is the order of the magnitude of the power of a light source so that the photons can knock me over ? To Skully : I often jump too quickly to answer a question , but it 's a bad habit . Solar sails and radiometers : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sailhttp : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes_radiometerIn fact , light is responsible for the motion of all electrons.As for the original question , I 'm going to assume that you 're a two meter long ( rather tall , actually ) 65 kilogram plank . Your center of gravity would have to be displaced about .25 meters ( off your feet ) to tip you over . Gravity exerts a maximum torque of about 80 N*m on you . At the top of your head , that torque produces 40 newtons . When it 's reflected , light exerts a `` pressure '' of 2*I/c where I is the intensity of light ( in watts per meter^2 ) . Multiplying both sides by area and plugging this into my calculator produces about 6 billion watts ( and remember , that 's if you wear a reflective surface on your head and it 's only enough to tip you over , not actually knock you down ) . I 'd say you 're pretty safe from sudden `` light gusts '' .",0

"Why should high school teenagers do their best in school ? What benefits will they get out of it ?

They told me that they didnt think education was important so they went to work after high school . I didnt listen to them . Now at age 24 , i had to redo or do classes i didnt complete in high school to get back into college and university that i should have done in high school .

"What was before the big bang that created the universe ? Since nothing can come from nothing , what did the universe come from ? Please approach this from a scientific viewpoint . This is a question that neither science or religion can ever `` prove . '' In our human capacity , it is unlikely anyone will ever know the answer to this . How can you even take a scientific approach to this ? You can speculate how the universe appears to be created based off measurements in the space , but you can always ask the question `` but what about before that ? '' Ultimately it comes down to faith , and I do n't necessarily mean in a God . You have faith that the universe was started somehow . Either God or some unexplainable cosmic phenomenon that we will never understand . Or both !",0

"Can a 14 year old talk to a 18 year ? If i 'm going on 14 and i want to talk to and 18 year older and we began to talk , what do you think would happen . I would strongly challenge the 18-year-old ( or older ) who would even talk with you , other than standard polite social acknowledgement . Someone who would provide mentorship is an obvious exception , but that is not how I understand the nature of the question . Since this question is in the `` Love and Romance '' category , it is obvious that something more would ultimately be sought from such contacts from one or both of the peoplpe involved . I would challenge the older person regarding his or her mental state , morals and ethics , primary relationships , and boundary issues , as well as remind him or her that any intimate action could verily easily be legally argued as statuatory rape . With all due respect to Diva4167 , I would also be concerned about the younger person 's primary relationships , as well as the fact that people of that age can be very fickle . Someone who can seem to be very special one day can seem horrible the next , because he or she is acting perfectly normally , but not within a set of ideals . 16 is the age to drive , 18 is the age of majority , and 21 is the legal drinking age . Those are the boundaries that this society has set , and there are consequences for blurring them . The difference between 24 and 28 is four years , but the difference between 14 and 18 is a lifetime . Live *your* life . Be well.Also , I would challenge why you felt it necessary to ask essentially the same question five times within a two-hour period . If you were an 18-year-old asking about a 22-year-old , I would be concerned about how he would react to your attention span . If you are serious about this , please just pose the question once , review the answers , and be done with it . Be well .",0

"New estimates for the cost of the Iraq war are up to 2 trillion dollars . Is this too much , or not enough ? A study by Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz and Harvard budget expert Linda Bilmes estimates the cost of the Iraq War at between $ 1-2 trillion ( the White house originally estimated costs of 100-200 billion . ) The study expands on budgetary estimates by including costs such as lifetime disability and health care for the over 16,000 injured . It also analyzes costs to the economy , including the economic value of lives lost and impact of factors such as higher oil prices that can be partly attributed to the conflict in Iraq . Is 2 trillion too much money to spend for the war against Iraq , or is it not enough ? it is to much money for a war that should of never been fought . i know that sadam housian is not a good person . but he did not bomb us . bin laden did . why arent we spending 2 trillion on a war with the guy who bombed us not with the guy that bushs daddy should have already gotten rid of . guess the apple dont fall far from the bush family tree .",0

It 's all a matter of trust . Obviously if you are freaking out about this , there is something about him or about your relationship with him that is making you suspicious in this situation . Getting obviously angry with him when there is no proof of wrongdoing will only make him angry and defensive in return , and nothing positive can be accomplished when that happens . Express to him ( calmly ) how this made you feel -- if he is at all worth your time and energy , he will totally understand how uncomfortable this must have made you , and be willing to discuss the reasons why .",0

Her answer was this is a once in a life time event . if you ruin it for me I 'll make you regret it for the rest of your life . and he responded by saying `` if I let you then I 'll still regret be the one regretting it for the rest of my life and so will you '' He then asked her what 's more important to her sleeping with a star or being married to me ? Her responce was to turn and leave with the pro and , off they went . Hubby in a fit of anger went back to the room packed all his clothers and hers and checked out . and drove home . On the way he contacted his atty . and filed for divorce . as well as canceled all the credit cards , and placed a stolen report on the checking account . Wifey several hours later after her little adventure with the ( pro ) was trying to get back into the room . and could not figure out why the card did not work . She contacted the front desk only to learn the hubby had left . She went crying back to the ( pro ) , and he laughed and asked her what did she expect no `` man '' worth his salt would want any thing to do with a `` slut '' once he is done with her . well after getting pissed , and the hollering and screaming between the lovers . the ( pro ) had her tossed out of the hotel for stalking . Now crying , and feeling miserable she tried repeatedly to call her hubby , and only got the Answering machine . she tried to use the credit cards and learned they did not work . Now thourly pissed in her own right she calls hubby back and rips him up one side and down the other and called him every name in the book , but eventually she found a ride home . only to learn all the locks on the house had been changes . He left a note on the door for her along with some cash telling her to go back to her hotel maybe she could sleep her way into another man 's life . Needless to say they ended up divorced , and she was left holding the bag as he got custody , and did not have to pay Alimony . So basically each person has to weigh the options in the relationship .

"Why ca n't a praying mantis be enlarged 80 times its size and survive ? A giant mantis has two reasons not to survive.To sum the consequenses up , a giant prayer mantis has difficulty taking in oxygen ; can not fly ; and will collapse.The first , the oxygen thing . Just as the previous answer indicates , insects intake oxygen via diffusion.Picture a room with perfect still air , like a cellar . Suppose you put an open bottle of perfume at one end of the room . Some time later , you can smell the perfume at the other end of the room . There 's no air current in the room to bring the fragrant to you . It 's the perfume molecules , they wander around randomly . Some of them find their way into your nostrils so you can smell them . You will be able to smell the perfume sooner in a smaller room because the molecules have to wander through a shorter distance.The blood of insects does not carry oxygen , they have a series of air-filled tubes ( called trachea , plural tracheae ) all over their body , opening to some 'port-holes ' ( called spiracles ) along their abdomen . Most of insects are so small that the oxygen molecules , once entered the spiracles ( port-holes ) , do n't have long to wander along the tubes before reaching their destination -- the organs where they are consumed . Now , suppose the same insect is enlarged 80 times its length . The airway is also enlonged 80 times . It would take a LOT more time for oxygen to wander along this super long tube . During that time , the organs would have consumed all the oxygen around them without new oxygen coming in . So they die , and the insect dying with them.However this is only the case for small insects . Larger insects actually have air-bags withing their body to make a breeze along their tracheae ( air tubes ) to bring in oxygen . Quoting from the sourse page , `` Larger insects , such as grasshoppers and wasps , have internal air sacs connected to their tracheae . These insects speed up their gas exchange by squeezing the sacs to make them suck air in from outside . '' I 've no idea whether a prayer mantis has air sacs or not , but I 've seen one bigger than any grasshoppers or wasps I ever saw . Nevertheless , a giant prayer mantis would need much more powerful air sacs than the grasshoppers'.Now come to the second reason . Size . We will look at the two consequences of a super-huge size seperately.Think of a car on a highway . It can drive over 100 feet in a matter of seconds -- let 's say 2 seconds , so it 's speed is 50 feet per second . Now the car shrinks to the size of a prayer mantis . In the same 2 seconds , how far can it drive now ? 1 feet , more or less , so it 's speed is 0.5 feet per second . We see that the mini car is much slower . But the driver , who shrank with the car , he thinks he 's driving as fast ! Now think of the mantis , and think of a helicopter . The mantis flies much slower than the helicopter , just like the mini car is slower than the real car . And we have it that the faster things move through the air , the more resistance they experience . The helicopter flies fast , so its shape must be streamlined , as to reduce air resistance . The prayer mantis flies slow , so he does n't care much about air resistance , he can have any cool shape he desires . But for a giant mantis ? He would move much faster , and experience so much air resistance that with his cool shape ( not much streamlined ) he wo n't be able to fly at all.Let 's face the second consequence . Has anyone ever made a jelly block 5 feet long , 5 feet wide and 5 feet high ? What will happen if such a giant jelly is constructed ? It would collapse right away and flow like water . But any half-inch long , half-inch wide , half-inch high jelly block would stay all right in one 's spoon . What happens when the jelly grows in size ? For each bit of jelly in the bottom , there 's simply much more jelly on top of it ! And when that bit of jelly can no longer bear the burden , it breaks itself and flow away so that it wo n't have to support any more . So th",0

"why is 13 considered unlucky ? Triskaidekaphobia is the fear of 13 , a number commonly associated with bad luck in Western culture . While fear of the number 13 can be traced back to medieval times , the word triskaidekaphobia itself is of recent vintage , having been first coined by Coriat ( 1911 ; Simpson and Weiner 1992 ) . It seems to have first appeared in the general media in a Nov. 8 , 1953 New York Times article covering discussions of a United Nations committee . This superstition leads some people to fear or avoid anything involving the number 13 . In particular , this leads to interesting practices such as the numbering of floors as 1 , 2 , ... , 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 , ... ( Sloane 's A011760 ; the `` elevator sequence '' ) , omitting the number 13 , in many high-rise American hotels , the numbering of streets avoiding 13th Avenue , and so on . Apparently , 13 has n't always been considered unlucky . In fact , it appears that in ancient times , 13 was either considered in a positive light or ( more commonly ) not at all ( Adams ) . The association of bad luck with the number 13 has been attributed to the fact there were 13 people at the Last Supper of Jesus , although this association seems to have originated only in medieval times . The association has also been linked to that fact that lunisolar calendars ( such as the Hebrew and Chinese calendars ) must have 13 months in some years in order to synchronize the solar and lunar cycles , while the solar Gregorian calendar in universal current usage always has 12 months in a year . Triskaidekaphobia also may be related to Norse mythology , which tells how the god Odin invited eleven of his closest friends to a dinner party at his home in Valhalla , only to have his party crashed by Loki , the god of evil and turmoil , thus giving a total of 13 people . The legend goes on to related how Balder , one of the most beloved gods , tired to throw Loki out of the party , resulting in a scuffle and ultimately Balder 's death with a mistletoe-tipped arrow . Fear of the number 13 also leads to fear of Friday the thirteenth ( a fear recently dubbed paraskevidekatriaphobia ) , despite the fact that Friday turns out to be the most common weekday on which the 13th of a month can occur in the Gregorian calendar . The association of bad luck with Friday appeared in Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales in the late 14th century ( `` and on a Friday fell all this misfortune '' ) , but references to Friday as a day associated with ill luck in general first appear around the middle of the 17th century ( Mikkelson and Mikkelson ) . In particular , it appeared in numerous publications as a particularly unlucky day to start a new venture ( beginning a journey , giving birth , getting married , moving , starting a new job , etc . ) beginning around 1800 ( Mikkelson and Mikkelson ) . While 13 is associated with the number of people at the Last Supper , the Crucifixion took place on a Friday , thus leading to an association of back luck with the combination of this number and day . Note that the association of Friday the thirteenth with the arrest of Jacques de Molay , Grand Master of the Knights Templar , on Friday , October 13 , 1307 by King Philip IV of France is a modern-day invention ( Mikkelson and Mikkelson ) . Paraskevidekatriaphobia is probably the most widespread superstition in the United States , possibly affecting tens of millions of Americans . Interestingly , a study by Scanlon et al . ( 1993 ) published in the prestigious British Medical Journal which analyzed the relation between health , behavior , and superstition surrounding Friday 13th in the United Kingdom by comparing the ratio of traffic volume to traffic accidents on Friday the 6th and Friday the 13th over a period of years found that , `` The risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52 % . Staying at home is recommended . '' While there does not appear to be hard evidence to support the claim , it has been suggested that $ 800 to $ 900 millio",0

"what does `` nobody can make you feel infrior without your permission '' mean ? what does `` nobody can make you feel inferior without your permission '' mean ? No one can MAKE you feel anything ( except physical pain of course ) . If you 're a professional dancer and some accountant who knows nothing about dance tells you you 're terrible , you 'll dismiss it because you do n't value his opinion . But if an accomplished dancer who you respect says the same thing it might make you actually question your talents , and feel inferior . In this case you would have given the dancer , but not the accountant , permission to make to make you feel inferior.But of course it might turn out that the dancer is old and bitter and wants to squash your potential by attacking your confidence . The key is to develop a solid sense of who you are - both your strengths and weaknesses . If someone attacks something you know is a strength , it should n't bother you . And if they attack something you know is a weakness - that really should n't bother you either because you 've accepted that this particular aspect is not your strongest .",0

"What the mean of Valentines Day to a mankind ... ? is worth it ... ? Valentine 's Day falls on February 14 , and is the traditional day on which lovers in certain cultures let each other know about their love , commonly by sending Valentine 's cards , which are often anonymous . The history of Valentine 's day can be traced back to an obscure Catholic Church feast day , said to be in honor of Saint Valentine , are discussed below . The day 's associations with romantic love arrived after the High Middle Ages , during which the concept of romantic love was formulated.The day is now most closely associated with the mutual exchange of love notes in the form of `` valentines . '' Modern Valentine symbols include the heart-shaped outline and the figure of the winged Cupid . Starting in the 19th century , the practice of hand writing notes has largely given way to the exchange of mass-produced greeting cards . The Greeting Card Association estimates that , world-wide , approximately one billion valentine cards are sent each year , making the day the second largest card-sending holiday of the year behind Christmas . The association also estimates that women purchase approximately 85 percent of all valentines",0
"My bad habit : chewing my fingers . What is the best way to stop it and break the habit ? I 've been chewing my fingers ever since I was in elementary . Nowadays , even at 20 - I occasionally chew on them when I get a little nervous or jittery , but I do n't even realize that . It 's getting a bit annoying and embarassing ... how do I stop it ? HMMMM some very interesting answers here that I like ... .Such as the rubber band idea . I would recomend that idea and see if that helps . If not ... .First of all as a former thumb sucker and smoker I understand oral fixations ( I quit the thumb thing a 12 started smoking at 13 and just quit that at 22 , about two months ago ) . Even now you will usually catch me with a touthpick , rubber band , bottle lid , pencils , or other item in my mouth . I have seriously cut back the habbit and consiously have to make efforts not to do it . Here are some suggestions . First of all peppers contain volitale oils that can chemically burn skin so avoid those . Purchase some alum powder and mix the powder with a few drops of water ( Enough to make a slightly runny paste . ) and soak your fingers in it . Alum is very , unpleasantly bitter and will immediately make your mouth pucker . Some people like lemon juice or tobasco so using those items usually does n't work because the taste is n't very strong . Next put up sticky notes at the places you are most like to do this . Repeating to yourself that this is bad trains your mind to avoid doing it subconsciously . If you are like me you also put your hand on your face ( or chin in hand , whatever ) . You can curb this action as well by improving your posture . Freeze yourself the next time you catch yourself doing this ( or finger chewing ) and analyze how you are sitting . Usually slumped with your elbow on the table or with your elbow semi supported by your stomach or chest . If you start improving your posture then you will become less inclined to hold your arm up unsupported for very long . I am using an exercise ball for a computer chair right now to retrain my posture . My doctor recomended it and I highly agree , I 've already noticed a difference.Cheer up though . Some studies say that finger chewing , nail biting , and other oral fixations are all signs of higher intelligence . It is believed that the brain in these cases works so fast that it actually gets bored or is somehow unstimulated . By controlling physical movement while mental processes such as reading or talking occur your brain is exercising itself and making you smarter and faster by training itself to multitask.Oh and a side note . Many people often notice that they chew nails/fingers in response to nervousness . The sucking/chewing motion is deeply ingrained in our most primitive side as being calming . When we are babies and we recieve food ( suckle ) subconciously we are aware of being protected by our mothers . The sucking/chewing motion along with full belly releases seratonin in the child inducing pleasure and happiness . In response to certain stresses adults will ocassionally do the same thing for the chemical calm it can induce , without even thinking about it . I tend to do this in the store especially when I ca n't find something . I feel lost and confused and tend to stick the tip of one or more finger in my mouth while looking .",0

"why is the Pacific Ocean so cold all the time ? the atlantic ocean is so warm , and the other ocean , the PACIFIC , is so cold . why ? In the southern half of the ocean the Humboldt Current flows north along the coast of South America . The cold mineral rich waters support many millions of small fish , which are eaten by larger fish and seabirds.At regular intervals a huge area of the Pacific becomes warmer . Because warm water rises above cold , the sea-level increases . This change in temperature and level causes an alteration in the pattern of the winds . The warm water travels across the Pacific at 100 kms a day . This phenomenon , known as El Nino , deflects the Humboldt Current . 1997 saw the highest temperature recorded of this warm water during the last 150 years .",0
"Although we see with two eyes a given object we see only one image.Why not two ? Although we see with two eyes , each of which creates its own , slightly different image , we normally have single vision , meaning we see only one image of an object . This is because your brain can normally control the muscles that move each eye carefully so that both are pointing accurately at the object you are looking at . When each eye produces its own image , your brain then joins them together into one . This gives us what is called ‘ single binocular vision ’ .Double vision can be an effect that you can create yourself . For example , if you hold your finger in front of your eyes and then look past it into the distance , you will experience double vision . This is normal .",0
"Why Were The Days of the Week Named After The Solar System ? I was just curious . I know that Sunday is named after the Sun . Monday=Moon , Tuesday=Mars , Wed.=Mercury , Thur.=Jupiter , Friday=Venus , & Sat.=Saturn ... But why exactly ? . Was it believed that those days revolved around each of those planets at that time ? or what ? Thanks . A long time ago in human history , people thought that Earth was flat , and at the universe 's center . They believed that seven members of the solar system forever circled around us—see graphic to the right , or view one from Censorinus - Sur le jour natal . Some Mediterranian peoples also believed that each hour of the day was ruled by either the Sun , Moon or one of five then-known planets , all of which were thought of as gods . The sequence in which they thought hours were governed was the inverse order of distance they believed those solar system objects to be from Earth . During this time , Egyptians thought that the most distant was Saturn , shown at the bottom of the graphic above . They thought that the order of closer members ( shown counterclockwise following Saturn ) was Jupiter , Mars , Sun , Venus , Mercury and closest , the Moon . So they believed that the first hour was ruled by Saturn , the second by Jupiter and so on . Egyptians also believed that after each seven hours the order in which these objects ruled was repeated , so it started again with Saturn . According to those ancient Egyptians , the planet that ruled the first hour also governed the entire twenty-four hour period , and gave its name to that day . The first ( and also the 8th , 15th and 22nd ) hours of the first day were sacred to Saturn , the 23rd to Jupiter , the 24th to Mars and the first hour of the next day to the Sun . Therefore , they believed that the first day was ruled by and named after Saturn ( Saturday ) and the second was ruled by ( and named after ) the Sun ( Sunday ) . Egyptians once divided all twelve 30-day months ( of their 360-day calendar year ) into three 10-day weeks in the same manner as Greeks of the same period . The epoch at which planet worship caused them to change its length to seven days is not known , but it must have been over twenty-five hundred years ago because Herodotus , writing in his History during the 5th century B.C . said : `` Here are some other discoveries of the Egyptians . They find ... each day belongs to a god ... '' Adherents of the cult of Sin at Harran , who were known as Harranians or Sabeans by Arabic and Syrian authors , named their days after the same solar system members as Egyptians and Persians . Like Hebrews and many other peoples , they considered the one named after Saturn to be the seventh day , so they began their week with a day named after the Sun . All seven days were named after solar system members in the same order as they were in Egypt . It is interesting to note that these exact same solar system objects , and in the same sequence , were also used to name days in ancient India , Tibet and Burma . This is also true of names for Japanese days of the week , but the custom there has been traced back only a thousand years . Roman soldiers stationed in Egypt became accustomed to the pagan seven-day week and began to introduce it into their own homeland to replace their eight-day marketing week . Octavian ( Caesar Augustus ) and succeeding Roman rulers permitted this practice but it was n't made official until the emperor Constantine took that step in A.D. 321 . English names for days of the week are derived from Anglo-Saxon names for those same seven heavenly bodies that were revered by ancient peoples . Compare those English and Anglo-Saxon day names in the table below . Other similarities between day and `` planet '' names in various countries can be observed there .",0

Just because it happens in the far reaches of the world from here does not mean that it is not ocurring . The indiscrimanate act of killing in Drive-by shooting 's is just an example of how it is happening in our own country . When we think of genocide we like to think of ages gone by , however our age is probably having more of this type of things as we have much better ways to kill these days .

"`` Shalom `` . most famous Jewish word in the world . A friend told me that behind this word ; there 's a story ? I mean some Jewish got an explaination . Its not a `` Jewish '' word , its Hebrew ( our language ) for 'peace ' . What sort of story do you mean ? It is one of the ways we greet each other . Historically , when coming to a camp , we would greet the sentry with `` shalom aleichem ! '' or `` peace be among you '' , ( almost a question and statement at the same time ) and the appropriate response from the sentry would be `` aleichem shalom '' or `` among us , there is peace '' This lets the vistors know that everything is fine at the camp , and that they are welcome to enter the camp . This is how it was done back then , and that form of answering with the subjects reversed remains to be the appropriate greetingUpdate : Toda , toda . Beruch ti hiyeh ! Update : Technically SFederow . In the example I used the senrty is speaking for the camp in its singular entirety . The person is asking the status of the camp as a whole , not simply the sentry himself .

"Which is the world 's oldest religion ? ? The world 's oldest religion , atleast chronologically from a historic perspective is Hinduism ( Sanatana Dharma ) . However , please keep in mind that everyone of every religion considers their religion to not be 'new ' . Christianity is seen as a fulfillment of prophecies based in Judaism . Baha'i is based upon prophecies in Islam . So as far as Judaism , Christianity , Islam , and Baha'i , if you ask a member of this religion they can each point backwards through the Abrahamic traditions to how each 'fulfilled ' other areas , thus keeping them within the same line . THe same can be said of Buddhism , Jainism , Sikhism , etc . So when asking this question it is best to be aware of what exactly you are wanting to know . As one Christian I know said `` Jesus was a part of God in the begining , thus Christianity is the oldest religion because Jesus was always a part of God , but it is young if you only compare it from a historic chronological perspective . '' I think that is well said.Thus from a Historice Chronological Perspective from oldest to youngest the religions go : HinduismZoroastrianismJudaismJainismBuddhismTaoismConfucismShintoChristianityIslamSikhismBaha'iNeoPaganism*Please note that many in the NeoPagan movement claim direct connection to the Pagan past and often direct it to a specific ancient culture/civilization , but not all . Some state that theirs is a new religion based upon a revitalization of ancient religions , but not the ancient religions themselves . So one has to be careful in this area , too . Native American beliefs and Shamanism are not listed , nor did I name Unitarian-Universalism , Rastafarianism , etc . I mainly listed major world religions . ( UUs do not necessarily view themselves as a religion in itself , but rather an approach to religion with many in a UU congregation holding a wide variety of beliefs from many of the worlds religions . There are some UU , though , who would claim that as their religion so no offense to those who do ) .",0

The farther you are away from an object , the weaker the gravitational pull will be.We say that gravity is `` inversely proportional '' to distance - meaning as distance increases , gravity decreases , and as distance decreases , gravity increases.More specificially , gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance - meaning that if the distance increases by a factor of 2 , gravity decreases by a factor of 4 , and if the distance increases by a factor of 3 , gravity decreases by a factor of 9 .",0

To ask if it was done by the USA is like asking do you think God tricked Adam and Eve in the garden ? Criminy , do you check your lunch to see if your mom put poison in it ? No , it was n't done by the USA . I am saddened that someone would think this is the case . And concerned that something so tragic and REAL is termed an EVENT . It was on TV , but it was n't pretend . It was n't in some other world . It was here , in this world , in your backyard , if you will . NO , the USA did n't do this . And as for the Twin Towers EVENT , I think it was terrible , a brutal surprise , and sadly , seemingly forgotten by most people , now that the dust and debris are cleared and swept away .

"Why do republicans or bush lovers think he is perfect ? ? ? It seems like everytime I talk to someone in favor of Bush they act as if everything he does it right . They never want to acknowledge that maybe he made a bad decision . Nobody is perfect and that includes the president .

"Where was the Cell Theoy created ? Cell theory historyIn 1838 , the botanist Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann , a physiologist discovered that both plant and animal cells had nuclei . From this realization , they surmised that all living things were composed of cells . In 1839 , Schwann published 'Microscopic Investigations on the Accordance in the Structure and Growth of Plants and Animals ' , which contained the first statement of the cell theory.Schwann and Schleiden 's statement of the cell theory was : Cells are the unit of structure , physiology , and organization in living things . Cells are both a distinct entity and a building block in the construction of organisms . Cells form by spontaneous generation .",0

"Has anyone lived in India ? What was your experience ? I want to visit but India is so vast and has so many appealing areas , that I would n't know where to begin ? Any advice ? it depends on what you want to do and see . I would n't say that I lived there , but I was there for 5 months . The longest period of time i was in one place was 2 months . Honestly i do n't even know where to begin describing what it was like . it was without a doubt a very positive , but sometimes stressful , experience . I think that everybody should travel to india at least once . I traveled only in the north , so that is the only area i can really give advice on . For the south i heard that Kerala , Hampi , and Pondicherry were the places to see , but I could n't tell you if that is true . To start with let me say that traveling in india is not as daunting as it seems . i started out with a program , but stayed on after its end when i realized that i would be able to get around on my own . unless you have about a year , you will probably not see everything , so do n't worry about seeing everything . You can probably get by just fine with only english , but it never hurts to know a little hindi or whatever the local language is , if only to see the shock on people 's faces . lol . The cost is very cheap , you can easily get by on $ 10 a day ( room , board , insurance , food , and maybe transportation ) . Sanitation is a big problem over there ( to us ! ) , but if you just use common sense you will be fine . it is a very safe country for the most part , but if you are a lone female you do need to exercise some caution . nearly every female traveller i came across had at least one complaint of minor harassment.the places that i saw that i really liked and/or you have to see are in the north : ladakh , dharamsala , manali , kashmir are all in the mountains and are much more relaxed than the cities in the central plains , although kashmir is not so safe in rajasthan : jodhpur without a doubt , jaipur is more popular with tourists but i did n't like it as muchin central india : agra of course , orchha ( near jhansi ) , varanasi ( stressful , but worth it for the sights and culture shock ) , khajuraho ( although they really go after tourists here ) , and delhi of course ( but it can be a bit stressful if you stay there too long ) in the east : darjeeling is a good place to chill , and i heard sikkim is amazingthe best advice i have , if you have n't already done it , is to get a guidebook ( i used lonely planet ) now and start looking at pics and reading about the places . i really hope that you get as much out of it as i did.if you do have any other specific questions , you can email me if you want : jeff32224 @ yahoo.comgood luck !",0

"According to news sites , the Earth 's rotation slows only 2 milliseconds each 100 years . So why the heck are ... so why the heck have we added like over 21 leap seconds in the past 30 years ? ? ? ! ! ! ! Something is not right . If the Earth only slows 2 milliseconds each hundred years , why not just add 2 milliseconds to the clock each century ? ! ! ! nothing to do with daylight savings . Daylight savings is a human invention , not a natural phenomenon ... .because leap seconds are not being added to compensate for the Earth 's rotation slowing down.The amount of time it takes for the earth to revolve around the sun is 365.2425 days.Even that is an approximation , the decimal digits can keep going on.So initially , the calendar was divided evenly in 365 days . But about every 4 years , you 'd be off 1 day . A century later , you 've drifted off by a whole month ! So , leap years came into effect . Febuary has another day every 4 years . But now you 've approximated a year to 365.25 days , when in reality , its 365.2425 days.Every century , you 'll be off 1 day.So that 's where the next rule comes into play : `` If the year is divisible by 4 , but not by 100 , its a leap year . `` Now we 've approximated it to 365.2425 , but because its always going to be an approximation , our calendar days are always slipping . All because the earth does n't take exactly 365 days to go around the sun.This is why leap seconds are added , and not to account for the slowdown of the earth 's rotation.As to why days are divided in exactly 24 hours , I 'm not sure . But I would think the time difference is WAY less than 20 minutes , or we 'd notice that soon enough , its dark at noon ! : ) Time was divided a long time ago , and a simple system was sought for keeping track of it , so the minuts/hour/year thing is a nice division thats easy to do math with . The lost time , if its accounted for by leap years and such , could be easier to manage.First , I never said the earth is not slowing down . I said its not why leap seconds exist . And ok , I can entertain my explanation may be wrong , but that 's no reason for your condescending tone , Jolly Roger . But look , your link brings me to a christian science evanglism site , where is the evidence that my answer is incorrect ? You have n't bothered to explain his original question . If leapseconds account for the slowdown of the earth 's rotation , why are there leap seconds and not leap milliseconds ? If you want to append to your answer , at least try to do so while respecting the other users on this site , and not insult their intelligence.This has piqued my curiosity , if there 's anyone out there that has a source that says my explanation is incorrect , I mean an actual science website , you know , one that steers clear of religion , please let me know .",0

"How do we use the matter waves of the electrons in an electron microscope ? Teacher said electrons are waves ( DeBrolie ) and we computed wavelength of an electron moving fast . He said electron microscope use electron waves to see tiny things . I asked if the matter waves were electromagnetic . He said no they are matter waves . I asked if they are not electromagnetic how can we observe them in a microscope . He said ... he did not know . Could you please help me ? An electron microscope bounces electrons off of things , captures them as they bounce off and then resolves a picture from the distribution of electrons that have returned . This is the same way a light bounces off stuff and we capture the reflected photons to make a picture with our eye . We cant see electrons with our eyes , though , so we need a machine to collect the scattered electrons and a computer to put an image together based on how the electrons scattered . The reason electrons can be used to see smaller things is that they have a `` shorter wavelength '' than visible light . The debroglie wavelength is n't a complete description of the wave properties of an electron or pohoton , but it is a good way to approximate many things . The wave function that describes an electron or a photon , or anything else is NOT a `` matter '' wave . That is a poor description . The wave itself is related to the probability that you will find the electron at a certain point in space , or with a certain property like velocity or spin . Your teacher is correct in saying that the electron is a wave , this wave can tell you the probability of measurements coming out a certain way , but the electron does not have characteristics like position or velocity UNTIL you measure them . Back to your question . As you know the debrolie shortens when momentum goes up . A shorter debrolie wavelength means that the electron is generally more localized than photons , which have relatively small momementums . If you want to bounce particles ( electrons of photons ) off say , two atoms separated by 1nm , the particle your sending toward it needs to be localized enough ( have a short enough wavelength ) so that it hits only one , and not both of them . A green photon would come waving in , hit both , and as it came back , the wave would be spread out so much that you could find it anywhere , and you couldnt make a picture of the two atoms no matter how many photons you bounced off of them . If you use electrons though , their wave function could be localized to bounce of only one or the other and based on where you measured it when it returned , you could use the information to resolve an image of the two atoms . This same idea is why you cant ( I 'm pretty sure ) resolve the image of the lunar landar on the moon with visible light . By the time the photons get back here from the moon , their wave functions have spread out to cover too large an area , and we cant tell exactly where they came from , resulting in a fuzzy , non-detailed image .",0
"May I Know which Organ Produces Blood PLasma ? I need it for school homework before 2 Febuary plz ! ! ! ! ! ! ! No organ produces Blood Plasma , it is a product of several organs or one could say the body . It consists of ( mostly ) water , salts ( electrolytes ) , and proteins ( albumin and antibodies being the majority ) . All the water , salts , and proteins ultimately are derived from the GI tract ; i.e. , what you eat . The water and salts are regulated by the renal system . Albumin is produced by the liver ( and it is in the majority for plasma protein ) and antibodies are a product of the immune system . There is also a balance of proteins and water within the vasculature ( intravascular space ) and without ( extravascular space ) . So , there is always an influx/efflux balance between your tissues and the vasculature depending on the osmostic pressure ( mostly ) and mechanical pressure . This is all in one giant balance or homeostasis most of the time . Hence , why it 's a good idea to see plasma as a total body product.I just read the above answers . Plasma is NOT produced in the bone marrow . Blood cells are produced in the marrow . Plasma is what you have left over when you remove those cells .",0

"I need to know the physics behind a helicopter 's flight. ? I need to know how a helicopter flies ( with equations , if possible ) and the possible problems a helicopter may experience in-flight . Thanks . Well , the physics of a helicopter is a very complex subject , but in essence it is only the blades of the helicopter pushing air down on the ground to lift it . The reason it starts to become complex is because the weight of the helicopter is thrown into the equation and the blades of it work in circular motion . The helicopter does have a coefficient of friction against it , which does not help the simplicity . The blades are angled to enhance the lift momentum . they´re 3 types of blades for helicopters and planes : BLADES WITH NO ANGLE ATACK , WITH SLIGHT ANGLE ATACK AND WITH STEP ANGLE ATACK.Also the blades spin in one direction , forcing the helicopter to actually spin in the other direction : Without the rear blade the helicopter would just spin due to Newton 's third law and action-reaction forces . The third law states that `` when one object exerts a force on a second object , the second exerts a force on the first that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction '' Action-Reaction forces means that for every force that the blades exerts , the body of the helicopter will spin proportional.The Rotor , blades in the rear , keep the helicopter going straight . They always oppose the force made by the blades.IN THE SOURCE PAGE I GAVE YOU YOU´LL FIND ALL THE EQUATIONS AND ANSWERS YOU NEED ABOUT THIS TOPIC .",0

The commoners spoke something related to the ancestor language of Dutch while the nobility spoke French .

"Anyone seen Puni Puni Poemy ? Anyone ? It 's a purpousely deranged Anime mini series . I love it . What do you all think ? I think PPP was supposed to be an extension ( in style , not in narrative ) of the last episode of Excel Saga - the one that never made it on the air in Japan , from my understanding . Nabeshin ( whose character is based on Watanabe Shinichiro , the director of both series ) is a recurring character . Interesting side note , at the end of ep . 25 of Excel Saga , Nabeshin marries the soup girl ( I forget her name ) - he 's still married to her in PPP , and Poemi is their daughter.Long and short , Watanabe had so much fun doing the `` forbidden '' episode of Excel Saga , that the production company gave him a two-episode OVA to do whatever the heck he pleased . And yeah , he pretty much did.My favorite moment in PPP is the absurd superpowers the sisters have . I can fall backwards without getting hurt !",0

"what are som of the benifits that are to be gained from drinking green tea ? Green tea contains polyphenols which give its antioxidant properties . Green tea ranks as high as or higher than many fruits and vegetables in the ORAC score , a score which measures antioxidant potential of plant-based foods . Numerous studies have demonstrated the anti-cancer properties of polyphenols . Some studies indeed suggested that tea 's polyphenols may reduce risk of gastric , esophageal and skin cancers if one consumes 4 to 6 cups daily . Other laboratory studies have found that polyphenols help prevent blood clotting and lower cholesterol levels.Personally I 'm not sure if I can drink 4 - 6 cups of green tea daily : - ) My patients always ask me about green tea and I always said a cup or 2 wo n't hurt at all - if you like the taste : - ) Take Care .",0
"who is Azazel in the Bible ? Azazel in LeviticusLeviticus 16:8 tells that the Lord ordered his high priest , Aaron , to 'place lots upon the two goats , one marked for the Lord and the other marked for Azazel ' on the Jewish Day of Atonement . The goat designated by lot for the Lord is to be used as a sin offering , while the goat designated for Azazel `` shall be left standing alive before the Lord , to make expiation with it and to send it off to the wilderness for Azazel . '' ( Lev 16:10 ) Aaron was to `` lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities and transgressions of the Israelites , whatever their sins , putting them on the head of the goat ; and it shall be sent off to the wilderness through a designated an . Thus the goat shall carry on it all their iniquities to an inaccessible region ; and the goat shall be set free in the wilderness . '' ( Lev 16:21-22 ) Leviticus also says that `` He who set the Azazel-goat free shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water ; after that he may reenter the camp . '' ( 16:26 ) From this passage in Leviticus , it would seem that Azazel is conceived of as a personal being , as lots were drawn for the Lord and for him . Also , Leviticus mentions that Azazel lives in the wilderness , as do the Se'irim . Because of this ritual , Azazel is known as the `` scapegoat . '' The goat that is sent to Azazel is not as a sacrifice , but as a symbol that there is no longer any unexpiated guilt . Both the goat and the man who leads away the goat are unclean , and the only way the man can reenter the camp is by washing his clothes and bathing . Azazel in the Apocalypse of AbrahamIn the Apocalypse of Abraham , Azazel is portrayed as an unclean bird which came down upon the sacrifice which Abraham prepared . This is in reference to Genesis 15:11 `` Birds of prey came down upon the carcasses , and Abram drove them away . '' `` And the unclean bird spoke to me and said , 'What are you doing , Abraham , on the holy heights , where no one eats of drinks , nor is there upon them food for men . But these all will be consumed by fire and ascend to the height , they will destroy you . ' And it came to pass when I saw the bird speaking I said this to the angel : 'What is this , my lord ? ' And he said , 'This is disgrace , this is Azazel ! ' And he said to him , 'Shame on you Azazel ! For Abraham 's portion is in heaven , and yours is on earth , for you have selected here , ( and ) become enamored of the dwelling place of your blemish . Therefore the Eternal Ruler , the Mighty One , has given you a dwelling on earth . Through you the all-evil spirit ( is ) a liar , and through you ( are ) wrath and trials on the generations of men who live impiously . '' - Apocalypse of Abraham 13:4-9The Apocalypse of Abraham also associates Azazel with Hell . Abraham says to him `` May you be the firebrand of the furnace of the earth ! Go , Azazel , into the untrodden parts of the earth . For your heritage is over those who are with you '' ( 14:5-6 ) There is also the idea that God 's heritage ( the created world ) is largely under the dominion of evil . It is `` shared with Azazel '' ( 20:5 ) Azazel is also identified with the serpent which tempted Eve . His form is described as a dragon with `` hands and feet like a man 's , on his back six wings on the right and six on the left . '' ( 23:7 ) Finally , the Apocalypse of Abraham says that the wicked will `` putrefy in the belly of the crafty worm Azazel , and be burned by the fire of Azazel 's tongue . '' ( 31:5 ) Here again , there is another reference to Azazel as being Hell .",0

"has any one out there taken the diet pill herbathin ? and how did it affect you ? Diet pills do work , although not forever . You see , diet pills are like any other drug your body builds resistance to them and their effectiveness wears off when you take them for a while . They do work short term but there are better ways to boost your metabolism and lose the weight.There are several ways to boost your metabolism but lets look at the factors that drive your metabolism first . 1 . Genetics - you have very little control , but you are not a prisoner of your genes . 2 . Lean Muscle Mass - this one throws most people off because women think , oh no I dont want muscles and men think I guess I have to look like a body builder . Lean muscle mass is simply your weight minus the weight of your organs , bones , fluids and fat . You increase lean muscle mass primarily through eating properly , resistance exercise , and a lifestyle that doesnt promote catabolizing activites ( smoking , heavy drinking and drug use ) 3 . Frequency of meals - the more meals the more the metabolic processes take place in your body and the faster your metabolism.4 . Water Intake - dehydration is a major drag on metabolism.Most people are dehydrated and they dont know it.5 . Sleep - getting enough rest allows the body to function at a higher metabolic level.You will learn more than you ever knew about metabolism from my source .

"what do i have to tell a broken hearted girl to encourage her to be as productive as she was before ? I think you should be commended for being s caring and considerate of this peson ! ! ! ! ! ! !

Sincerely.As I 'm sure you know tho , when it comes right down to it , and as unfortunate as it is ... ..time is the only cure for this affliction . It 's awful to go thru . Aside from that I 'm afraid all you can do is give her whatever she needs from moment to moment . We all deal with this differently . Sometimes one needs constant distraction ; friends , work , activities , etc . Other times it 's alone-time . Solitude to ponder , grieve , and wallow for a while . Figure out what this is for her , and maybe you can recruit some of the others to help , maybe without letting on what 's going on ( unless it 's obvious ) .I 'm guessing but it may be that the best thing all the way around is , that you take the hit and try to pick up her slack . It may sound like I am saying that in a very perfunctory manner , but it may just be easier for you ... .and she ... .that you help fill the void while she gets what she needs ... ..time.At the same time , she does need gentle reminding that she still has responsibilities to uphold . Perhaps if done right she may be able to use this as a crutch or distraction while she 's at work , and then use her home time to wallow , cry and be miserable.My best of luck to you .

"Anyone give me a definitive answer about the origins of the term `` o.k. '' ? thanks ? The letters , not to keep you guessing , stand for `` oll korrect . '' They 're the result of a fad for comical abbreviations that flourished in the late 1830s and 1840s . Read buttressed his arguments with hundreds of citations from newspapers and other documents of the period . As far as I know his work has never been successfully challenged.The abbreviation fad began in Boston in the summer of 1838 and spread to New York and New Orleans in 1839 . The Boston newspapers began referring satirically to the local swells as OFM , `` our first men , '' and used expressions like NG , `` no go , '' GT , `` gone to Texas , '' and SP , `` small potatoes . '' Many of the abbreviated expressions were exaggerated misspellings , a stock in trade of the humorists of the day . One predecessor of OK was OW , `` oll wright , '' and there was also KY , `` know yuse , '' KG , `` know go , '' and NS , `` nuff said . `` Most of these acronyms enjoyed only a brief popularity . But OK was an exception , no doubt because it came in so handy . It first found its way into print in Boston in March of 1839 and soon became widespread among the hipper element . It did n't really enter the language at large , however , until 1840 . That 's when Democratic supporters of Martin Van Buren adopted it as the name of their political club , giving OK a double meaning . ( `` Old Kinderhook '' was a native of Kinderhook , New York . ) OK became the warcry of Tammany hooligans in New York while beating up their opponents . It was mentioned in newspaper stories around the country.Van Buren 's opponents tried to turn the phrase against him , saying that it had originated with Van Buren 's allegedly illiterate predecessor , Andrew Jackson , a story that has survived to this day . They also devoted considerable energy to coming up with unflattering interpretations , e.g. , `` Out of Kash , Out of Kredit , and Out of Klothes . '' Newspaper editors and publicists around the country delighted in coming up with even sillier interpretations -- Oll Killed , Orfully Konfused , Often Kontradicts , etc. -- so that by the time the campaign was over the expression had taken firm root nationwide .",0

"Why are Christians so mean ? I 'm watching the news and what do I see ? They are now out picketing at funerals of dead soldiers that `` God hates fags '' . Yep . They are picketing the private mourning of families of solders , straight or gay , whose lives were tragically destroyed.I 'll admit , the whole God thing is a joke anyway , but is n't this just getting out of control ? I wish some crazed lunatic would drive by their picket line and mow them all down while simultaneously blowing their church to the top of Mt . Ararat.And since I 'm sure there will be a barrage of people saying the picketers are on the fringe , I have to say unfortunately they are not . They are all over the place . In our White House and now running the Supreme Court.I dare any one of you to actually read , word for word , the first four books of the Bible and tell me if you find it to be anything short of totally delusional.There are no such things as talking animals or invisible dead people with wings . Fred Phelps and the members of the Westboro Baptist Church *are* a fringe element . Most Christians would *not* picket the funeral of a deceased homosexual , or a deceased soldier who died in Iraq ( yep , Fred Phelps does that too ) . He is a crazy man who just happens to have a few followers , and they are very vocal . However , many bad things in the world have been perpetrated in the name of Christianity , such as the Crusades , slavery , witch hunts , the persecution of homosexuals , lesbians , bisexuals , and transgendered person today . This does not make all Christians `` mean '' or `` bad '' , just like all Russians are not tyrants because of Stalin and all Muslims are not out to destroy America because Al Queda makes attacks in the name of Islam and Allah . Individuals do bad things , groups are not to be defined by those individuals , even if there are a lot of them.Furthermore , the first 4 books of the Bible ( Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , and Numbers ) are not , strictly speaking , Christian compositions . They are the first 4 books of the Jewish Torah , and the Christians `` inherited '' them . This is *not* an attempt to say that `` it 's not Christians who are crazy , it 's the Jews ! `` , but rather a clarification as to the origin of those texts . They certainly *are* Christian texts in that they are used extensively by Christians and form a great deal of basic Christian belief ( the Creation , the Flood , the Abrahamic Promise , etc. ) . The Muslims *also* use these texts as a foundation for Islam , because they also consider themselves to be children of the Abrahamic Promise , descended from Abraham 's elder son , Ishmael . Thus , these books are given credence by three of the world 's major religions , making their `` delusional '' quality somewhat moot because of the sheer number of people who accept those `` delusions '' as true.There are a great many Christians who do try to conduct themselves well , based on their intreptation of what that means . Now , I do n't like their stance on abortion , but it comes from a genuine interest in the rights of the unborn , as people , as opposed to a genuine desire to degrade women to the simple status of breeding stock . Many Christians give charitable donations , such as for the tsunami or Hurricane Katrina , or other disasters . Many Christians go out of their way to be kind to other people . And many of these `` kind '' Christians do n't go about blowing their `` Look at me , I 'm a Christian '' whistle , the way the `` mean '' ones seem to do so often . So , the answer would be that individual Christians are mean for the same reason that individual atheists , individual Muslims , individual police officers , individual cat-kicking children , or individual pizza delivery guys are mean . They just are , and it 's not a reflection on the group at large .",0

"was there a man named john appleseed ... ..and did he start out in illonoise ? Johnny Appleseed in real life was one John Chapman , born on September 26,1774 near Leominster , Massachusetts . Little is known of his early life , but he apparently received a good education which helped him in his later years . By the time he was 25 years old , he had become a nursery man and had planted apple trees in the western portions of New York and Pennsylvania . Some of the orchards in those areas were said to have originated with his apple trees.When the rich and fertile lands lying south of the Great Lakes and west of the Ohio river were opened for settlement in the early 1800 's , John Chapman was among the very first to explore the new territory . This was the Northwest Territory from which the states of Ohio , Michigan , Indiana , and Illinois were later formed . For nearly half a century Johnny Appleseed roamed his territory . When settlers arrived , they found John Chapman 's young apple trees ready for sale . In the years that followed , he became known as the Apple Tree Man , or Johnny Appleseed.His manner of operation was simple . He went into the wildreness with a bag of apple seeds on his back until he found a likely spot for planting . There he would clear the land by chopping out weeds and brush by hand . Then he planted his apple seeds in neat rows and built a brush fence around the area to keep out straying animals . His nurseries varied in size . Some were only an acre or so , others covered many acres.He did all of the work himself , living alone for weeks at a time with only the Indians and wild animals for companionship . He never carried a gun or weapon of any kind . He was a deeply religious man who lived by the Golden Rule and had no fear of man or beast . Indians accepted him as a friend , and he is reputed to have talked at times to the wild animals who watched him as he worked in his nurseries . Undoubtedly , they sensed his kind and gentle nature . Once , it is reported , he was caught in a snow storm and crept into a hollow fallen tree for shelter . He found it occupied by a hibernating bear and her cubs , but spent the night there nonetheless . There is no report , however , of how much space he kept between them and himself.John Chapman was a practical businessman as well as a sincere Christian . Somewhere , somehow , he had caught a vision of the winderness blossoming with apple trees , orchard after orchard of carefully nurtured trees , whose fragrant blossoms gave promise of a fruitful harvest for the settlers . Willingly he endured the hardships of his wilderness life as he worked to make his dream come true . His sturdy young trees lightened the hearts and lifted the spirits of many settlers , for there is a suggestion of a permanent and loving home when one plants fruit trees around a cabin.He sold his trees for a few pennies each , accepting any of the coins current on the frontier . Some had no cash , and from those he accepted a simple promise to pay at a later date . Few failed to keep their word . He sometimes accepted payment in used clothing.As he was a small man , his bartered clothing usually fit him poorly . This led to some of the humorous descriptions of his appearance in those early years . Like many of the settlers , he went barefooted a great deal because shoes were hard to come by and seldom fit his tough gnarled feet . As he ate no meat , he carried a stewpot or kettle with him . In this he could gather nuts or berries in season , carry water , get milk from a settler 's cow , boil potatoes , or drop a handful of coarse-ground meal into the boiling water to make an unpalatable but nourishing meal . He has been pictured wearing such a pot on his head , but more likely he kept it tied to his pack rather than let it bounce on his head.He preferred to walk , carrying his precious apple seeds and the simplest of camping gear on his back . He also used a boat , canoe , or raft to transfer larger loads of seeds along the many waterways . Customarily , he obtained his apple seeds every fall . At first , he",0

"How do you change direction when swimming freestyle in a pool ? You know what I mean : good swimmers just kind of do a 180 and then kick off in the opposite direction . It 's clear that you have to flip over and turn over , but I find it tricky . I 'm generally very coordinated , so I think I just need some tips . A flip turn is done by basically gliding into the wall and flipping into a back-stroke glid and eventually turning back onto your front . With your momentum carrying you into the wall , tuck your head under so your upper torso will be on its back . Your legs will follow over and the momentum will carry your legs into the wall . In the glide position on your back slowly turn back onto your front . As you improve and get your orientation you will be able to flip while on your side , and will be able to more efficiently do your turn . Things to watch when turning , work on your timing coming into the wall . You will need to be able to judge when you should start your flip turns , that 's what the T on the lane lines are for . Keep from going to deep when doing your turns . Keep your body stream lined into the wall and coming off the wall . Think of your body as hinged at your hips and keep both halves extended when flipping - only the hinge bends . Good luck .",0

"Is the Brady Bill based on a Nazi Gun Control Law ? I was told it was the exact same - almost word for translated word . Ridiculous .

And the group further claims that when the Brady Bill attempts to outlaw private ownership of semi-automatic weapons ( which are only good for killing large numbers of people quickly , in war or otherwise , or practising to do so ) it is applying this distinction first developed in Nazi law . But 1 ) that is a far cry from the Brady Bill being a `` translation '' of Nazi legislation , 2 ) the Brady Bill ban on selected semi-automatic weapons is not the same as a ban on private ownership of any weapon not suitable for sporting use , and 3 ) the concept of a ban on such weapons in private hands goes back way before the Nazis , and existed throughout Europe , back into the days of Kings and nobility . It was not invented by the Nazis.Oppose gun control if you like . But this is not a reason to do so .",0

"Can you give me a overview of Memoirs of Geisha ? From Library Journal '' I was n't born and raised to be a Kyoto geisha ... .I 'm a fisherman 's daughter from a little town called Yoroido on the Sea of Japan . '' How nine-year-old Chiyo , sold with her sister into slavery by their father after their mother 's death , becomes Sayuri , the beautiful geisha accomplished in the art of entertaining men , is the focus of this fascinating first novel . Narrating her life story from her elegant suite in the Waldorf Astoria , Sayuri tells of her traumatic arrival at the Nitta okiya ( a geisha house ) , where she endures harsh treatment from Granny and Mother , the greedy owners , and from Hatsumomo , the sadistically cruel head geisha . But Sayuri 's chance meeting with the Chairman , who shows her kindness , makes her determined to become a geisha . Under the tutelage of the renowned Mameha , she becomes a leading geisha of the 1930s and 1940s . After the book 's compelling first half , the second half is a bit flat and overlong . Still , Golden , with degrees in Japanese art and history , has brilliantly revealed the culture and traditions of an exotic world , closed to most Westerners . Highly recommended.- ? Wilda Williams , `` Library Journal '' According to Arthur Golden 's absorbing first novel , the word `` geisha '' does not mean `` prostitute , '' as Westerners ignorantly assume -- it means `` artisan '' or `` artist . '' To capture the geisha experience in the art of fiction , Golden trained as long and hard as any geisha who must master the arts of music , dance , clever conversation , crafty battle with rival beauties , and cunning seduction of wealthy patrons . After earning degrees in Japanese art and history from Harvard and Columbia -- and an M.A . in English -- he met a man in Tokyo who was the illegitimate offspring of a renowned businessman and a geisha . This meeting inspired Golden to spend 10 years researching every detail of geisha culture , chiefly relying on the geisha Mineko Iwasaki , who spent years charming the very rich and famous.The result is a novel with the broad social canvas ( and love of coincidence ) of Charles Dickens and Jane Austen 's intense attention to the nuances of erotic maneuvering . Readers experience the entire life of a geisha , from her origins as an orphaned fishing-village girl in 1929 to her triumphant auction of her mizuage ( virginity ) for a record price as a teenager to her reminiscent old age as the distinguished mistress of the powerful patron of her dreams . We discover that a geisha is more analogous to a Western `` trophy wife '' than to a prostitute -- and , as in Austen , flat-out prostitution and early death is a woman 's alternative to the repressive , arcane system of courtship . In simple , elegant prose , Golden puts us right in the tearoom with the geisha ; we are there as she gracefully fights for her life in a social situation where careers are made or destroyed by a witticism , a too-revealing ( or not revealing enough ) glimpse of flesh under the kimono , or a vicious rumor spread by a rival `` as cruel as a spider . '' Golden 's web is finely woven , but his book has a serious flaw : the geisha 's true romance rings hollow -- the love of her life is a symbol , not a character . Her villainous geisha nemesis is sharply drawn , but she would be more so if we got a deeper peek into the cause of her motiveless malignity -- the plight all geisha share . Still , Golden has won the triple crown of fiction : he has created a plausible female protagonist in a vivid , now-vanished world , and he gloriously captures Japanese culture by expressing his thoughts in authentic Eastern metaphors.Amazon",0

"Optical vs RCA inputs for surround sound ? I want to add an audio enhancer between my DVD player and reciever but Im using optical and my exciter/enhancer has only RCA conectors . Will my reciever know if its DTS or Dolby using the RCA conections instead of the optical ? I want to use an enhancer to get a crisp sound and hear the dialog better . It sounds muddy . The speakers are of great quality . Standard RCA connectors will not and should not carry digital signals . In order to use the 5.1 RCA connectors , your DVD player will have to decode the Dolby or DTS signal , convert it to analog , and pass it through the 7.1 outputs to your receiver . Your receiver will not have to know if it is Dolby of DTS because it will be an analog pass through .",0
"Realistically , Who would you want to be president in '08 ? No silly answers , but I 'm open to both parties answers ... First off , I 'm a Democrat.Let 's see , Hillary Clinton 's got too much bad stuff on her already , plus it would seem like husband trying to get wife elected.Barack Obama 's a very good speaker , but he 's relatively inexperienced . Maybe in 2012.I 'd go with Russ Feingold . He 's good-looking , he 's eloquent , and I think he truly cares about the people . Plus , he co-sponsored the Campaign Reform Act ( it 's bipartisan ! ) , winning him some more points . For Vice President , I 'm not sure , but someone from the South , religious but not too much , young and charismatic . Maybe John Edwards again ...

"what do these college sports phrases mean ? 1 ) true freshman 2 ) fifth year senior 3 ) walk on 4 ) red shirt . Thanks The NCAA rules allow a player 5 years to complete his/her 4 years of eligibility.A true freshman is someone playing during the first year of eligibility.A fifth year senior is someone who sat out a year ( see red shirt ) and is completing the 4th year of eligibility during his/her 5th year in school.A walkon is someone who was not recruted and given a scholarship . The athlete just showed up , tried out , and was good enough to stay on the team.A red shirt is an athlete who is passing up a year of play to extend eligibility . Red shirted players are allowed to practice with the team but not take part in competition.Originally , red shirting was allowed if an athlete was injured severly enough to end his season . The team could petition the NCAA for an extra year of eligibilty , and the player was red shirted for the remainder of the year.The name comes from the practice of having injured football players wear a red practice jersey to protect him during practice . Today redshirting may be done to allow a player to gain an extra year of experience before playing in `` The Big Time '' . It also may be done as a personel management tool . If a coach has two equally good players competing for one position as quarterback , one may be redshirted . That way his eligability is n't used up sitting on the bench .",0

On the one hand you have all these supposed justifications for the reasons we are there but they just contradict the reasons we are really there.If the current adminstration and the administration before it , for that matter , was so concerned about humanitarian issues , I do not see why we were not in the Congo or other REAL hotspots in the world with our `` Shock and Awe '' show of force .

"Isnt it a double standard ... . ? when Mayor Nagin said he wanted New Orleans to be an all `` Chocolate '' ( black ) city ? It bothers me that what he said was condoned and excused .

In our attempts to make ammends for the actions of our fore-fathers , we 've become accepting in the extreme .

"my mother has fibromyalgia , anyone have ideas on treatments ? she currently uses heat and pain pills I have had Fibro since I was 16 and am now almost 36 . I have seen more doctors over the years than I can count from Neurologists to Rhuematologists to Chiropractors to Psychiatrists to Pain Specialists . In my experience pain medications do not work . A muscle relaxant is much more helpful . I have also tried biofeedback , steroid shots , trigger point injections , two sleep studies , nerve blocks , accupuncture , foot braces , wrist braces , carpal tunnel release surguries , and so much more . All just torture and I felt like a guinea pig.My best advise is make sure to get plenty of sleep , take a multiple vitamin , keep active in at least low impact sports , and consider Magnesium and Malic Acid supplements ( consult the doctor or a nutritionist to have her Magnesuim level checked- it is a simpe mouth swab and not painful ) , meditation does help some in keeping the pain back if you can seperate your mind from the pain , and try to take 2-3 warm Epson Salt baths a week ( Epson salt contains Magnesium and soaking in a warm tub of it helps to get the mineral into the body . Magnesium aids the muscles in using oxygen and when the level is low which is typical in Fibro it can cause are cramps , spasms , and pain . ) Also , Fibromyalgia is a neurotransmitter disorder and certain foods can trigger similiar symptoms to Fibro . Try to have her eliminate Monsodium Glutamate from her diet . I did and some of my symptoms ( chronic headaches and nausea ) went away . It is in everything from Doritos to chicken soup . A few key finding 's of an FDA study found MSG to cause a `` burning sensation in the back of the neck , forearms and chest '' . Otherwise , learn your limits and pace herself.Good luck !",0

"How do u make an ice-rink in ur backyard ? ? ? ? ? ? I want 2 make 1 but i dont no how . I made a workable ice rink for my daughter in our back yard while she was very young . She later competed in figure skating competitions.At a hardware store , buy a roll of plastic that opens as wide and at least as long as your rink will be . The plastic is only a few mils thick and usually comes in black or clear , for example it is used as a painting drop cloth , etc . The thicker the better . Clear will absorb less sunlight avoiding melting.Lay out the rink using a tape measure to a length and width slightly less than the dimensions that tthe single sheet of plastic sheet will be . Overlapping sheets may drain unless poured slowly in very cold weather . Before the ground is frozen , dig a trench all around the rink inside your lines and make a pile of soil all around the outside of the trench that will be slightly higher than the ground inside the rink . Lay down the plastic sheet over the ground and trench and piled earth . Fill the plastic covered ground with water nearly to the top of the earth piles and let it freeze . Add more watter if needed.You can make your rink square or rectangular or even oval and size will depend on the plastic sheet and your space available . Do not walk on the plastic sheet because you may make drain holes . A double layer of plastic would help avoid puncture from sharp stones , etc . Try to build on very level ground as water will seek a level surface . Try to build away from anything that could cause injury if a skater lost control or fell outside the rink . Try to avoid skating on the edge which would cut the plastic and allow water to drain during a thaw . Perhaps provide a piece of old carpet where skaters have to step over the edge . Do enjoy ! Good luck.BTW our pump water had a lot of mineral and did not make good ice . City water or rain water would have been much better - but it worked !",0

"how do you remove a charge off from a credit report ? If you have a charge off , you have to pay the debt . That 's the only way to get rid of it . You can wait 7 yrs til it falls off your credit report , but you still owe the money , collectors will continue to call you . A charge-off is a term used to explain a debt that is over 180 days past due . If you wait for it to fall of your credit report , you also run the risk of them filing a judgement against you ( which is on your credit report for 10 years ! ) , or suing you for the money before the 7 years . LOL at all the people who think that your debt disappears after 7 years . That 's just the limit as to how long it can hurt your credit . You will always owe the money.The other people who have responded have responded in a way as if the debt was n't a valid debt . If this debt is rightfully yours , a letter of dispute or any of the suggested things are useless .",0
"Has anybody had annemia from hepatitis c treatment , please relate ? I have not personally been treated with Pegylated IFN and Ribavirin , but anemia is common with Ribavirin treatment . It is the leading reason Ribavirin doses are decreased during treatment for Hepatitis C. Hopefully you doctor is comfortable using Epogen or Procrit to allow you to maintain the highest possible dose of Ribavirin during your therapy . Using `` growth factors '' or agents such as Epogen ( or `` epo '' ) or Procrit to boost red blood cells and keeping the dose of Ribavirin as high as possible will increase the liklihood of clearing the virus and achieving an SVR.Best wishes and good luck !",0

Well , you should definately date him then ... no wait , that does n't make sense.Look , you are in a relationship . You have to deal with that first , long distance or not ... you have to respect yourself enough to honor that . If you want to stay committed there can be no question of dating other people . That should end the questions right there . If you are n't sure about the long distance relationship , end it or stipulate that you are going to see other people . Once you are there you can make a decision . Going on a date with your friend to see what happens does not commit you to him forever , but it can be cruel and encourage him . It could also endyour friendship ( wow , I just broke the guy-code and encouraged you to use the `` I like you , but as a friend line '' . I 'll probably burn in guy-hell ( which is probably a lot like ballet performed by drag queens ) If you do n't feel like you are romantically interested in him you should tell him . By the way , it is okay not to be in a relationship at all , if it comes to that .",0
"Have you ever torn a ligament in your knee , how long does it take to heal ? I dislocated my knee about 3 months ago .

"What do u think about current Nepal 's suitation ? At present , King has taken all the power and ruling of its own . Lot of protest goin on well , as of now , there are lots of activities that are going on , both overt and covert . on the surface , you have a king holding on to power by a slim thread , a thread called the Royal Nepalese Army . a thread that can break anytime because after all the soldiers too are humans and the way things are , a potential revolutionary situation is in the making ... .sdnt wonder if there are already cracks in the army . also we have the maoists who control nearly two-thirds of the country and only stopping short of storming the capital and taking power because of the big neighbour by the side , India , which has got its own maoist insurgency and India will not be too happy to see a communist country come up so close to borders . so that is a consideration . the political ( democratic ) party , i think have lost the people more or less , so the people dont have any place to go except the maoists or the royalists ... .whether the maoists are good or bad ( to put very simplistically ) is irrelevant , what is relevant is that the king is on his last legs ( the fact that people are coming out against him openly in a place where kings were once revered as incarnation of God , is proof enough of his complete loss of authority ) and may come crashing down soon ... .as to what will happen after that , depends on the tussle of will between maoists , the neutral people inside nepal and India and China to an extent.very interesting days ahead i am sure ! ! !",0

Do all this in one fluid motion , if it 's a solid fence , if it 's a chain-link fence you 've got it made . They have plenty of hand and foot holds to use . Just do n't be nervous , and practice makes perfect . Find a fence of someone you know , or go to a ball diamond ( that fence is usually 6ft and chain link ) and practice , practice , practice .

"George Reeves ( Superman ) Murder or Suicide ? George Reeves - Actor 1914-1959 George Keefer Brewer was born in Woolstock , Iowa on January 5 , 1914 . Probably best known for his acting career in the hit Superman TV series during the 1950 's George was a well accomplished film and play actor as well . He starred in numerous leading and supporting roles in a variety of famous films dating back to 1939 including the blockbuster `` Gone with the Wind '' where he portrayed one of Scarlet 's suitors.George Reeves was 45 years old in 1959 when he was found dead in his home from a single gun shot . Many people speculate that he was murdered but his death was ruled a suicide predicated on the fact that he was in a deep depression state due to his inability to find acting work because he was typecast as superman . I personally do not believe that he took his own life , this man was strong willed , full of life and had everything to live for.The circumstances of his mysterious death and the investigation that followed left many unanswered questions and speculation . On the evening of his death , George was entertaining his girlfriend and a few friends in his lavish Hollywood home when he reportedly went upstairs by himself to his bedroom . After about a half hour the guests heard a single gun shot and found George lying dead on his back across the side of the bed with his feet still on the floor . George was killed instantly my a German Luger pistol bullet that went through his skull and lodged in the wall above his bed near the ceiling . The shell casing from the bullet was found after the police picked him up , he had been laying on it . It is still unknown as to how the casing got there and how George could of been lying on the shell casing if he would have taken his own life . No suicide note was found , and there was never the slightest indication from George that he might be in a depressed state . This is one of those mysteries that we may never find out the real truth .",0

"Public Nudity ? Public Nudity erotic or shocking ? Neither erotic nor shocking , but sometimes pretty gross . Fact is , most people are more attractive in clothes than out of them ; those clothes hide a lot of flaws . Plus , a nude beach makes too much of the physical aspects of a person , and too little of character , intelligence , personality , etc . Plenty of perfectly wonderful people are not into showing their bodies naked to the general public . On the other hand , there are only too many people who are exhibitionistic for very cynical reasons : money , power , the like . It 's all very well to be a sun worshipper , and a nice private back yard can be wonderful that way ; but public is another matter altogether .",0

"what does the government hide from the people ? Things that would harm the 'security ' of the government . Sounds nice , but in reality , they hide anything that would interfere with the status quo . Since they do n't want a wrong impression of what they have screwed up in the past , they hide pretty much everything they use to make decisions and the actions they take under the premise of 'the interest of national security ' . This could be technology which would help enemies ( so-called ; expanding who constitutes an 'enemy ' greatly expands what can be kept secret ) , anything that would ruin our economy or the main corporations which support it , anything that might reveal how our weapons work , policies about how things are REALLY kept secret , plans for keeping the government ( and friends ) safe after a major attack , strategic sources of materials which are n't publicly disclosed already , scientific data that might cause panic , scientific data that might cause distrust of the government , inventions which could be used as weapons ( yes , they monitor patent applications ) , and all the usual things like who is a spy for who , how we monitor communications , how other countries monitor our communications ( and sell us the info ) , how much money our intelligence agencies spend , and who in our country is suspected of being a threat to any of the above things.I think that pretty much covers it . If anything like paranormal activity , UFO 's , or antigravity technology falls under the categories above , welllllll ... .And do n't forget that they wo n't tell you if something they tell you is really false or misleading so that you do n't investigate something else they are hiding . The interconnected web of confidentiality agreements , classified documents , and disinformation is not an accidentaly complicated system . It is meant to confuse people . Just like the aisles in a store which make you go around things just so you spend more time looking at and buying things you otherwise were n't interested in . It 's all in the marketing .",0

Then you will put the first gauze in the water just for a second ; now place this gauze in the face of the doll and continue doing the same thing with the other gauzes.You have to create at least 4 or 5 layers of these special gauzes . 3 . Then let them dry in the room . 4 . After that you can paint it as you prefer and separate it from the doll 's face.Good luck ! Katerina",0
"is there any care or prevention for demintia or alzymers disease ? I have heard that using your brain more can help delay or prevent Alzheimers , though not scientifically proven . Puzzles like Mensa , Soduku , brain teasers may help.Efforts to find effective treatments for Alzheimer 's after-the-fact have so far been disappointing . Age is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer 's . The baby boom is approaching its golden years . Indeed , much of the concern about the solvency of governmental social safety nets is founded on estimates of the costs of caring for baby boomers , assuming that they develop Alzheimer 's in the same proportions as earlier generations.One study ( `` Leisure Activities and the Risk of Dementia in the Elderly , '' New England Journal of Medicine [ 8 ] ) found that people who played chess on a regular basis went on to get Alzheimer 's at a substantially lower rate than the general population . The chess relationship was stronger than any other factor , including dancing and solving crossword puzzles , both of which were also shown to be inversely proportional to getting Alzheimer 's disease.In a number of retrospective studies , regular physical exercise has appeared to be inversely related to the development of Alzheimer ’ s . The Alzheimer 's risk of those exercising regularly was half that of the least active . This research is consistent with the observation that virtually all measures designed to promote cardiac fitness and reduce stroke risk also seem to reduce Alzheimer 's risk . However in one study , dance appeared to be the only exercise effective in reducing risk . One explanation is that dancing requires the use of complex mental skills such as performing correct steps while at the same time keeping track of the music . The presence of cardiovascular risk factors -- diabetes , hypertension , high cholesterol and smoking -- in middle age ( ages 40 to 44 ) was found very strongly associated with late-life dementia ( Neurology 2005 ; 64:277-281 . PMID 15668425 ) .",0

"What are the sympthoms of macular oedema ? An eye disease that diabetics might get . History : Ocular historyDiabetic history - Specific inquiry should be made into risk factors for the development of DR.Type of diabetes - After 20 years of disease , nearly all patients with type I and 60 % of patients with type II have some degree of retinopathy.Duration of the diabetes - Increased risk of DRAge of patient - DR is more likely to present in patients older than 40 years.Diabetic control - The Diabetes Control and Complication Trail ( DCCT ) has clearly demonstrated that tighter control of blood sugar is associated with reduced incidence of DR. ( Glycosylated hemoglobin [ HbA1c ] should be less than 7 % . ) Renal disease - Proteinuria is a good marker for the development of DR ; thus , patients with diabetic nephropathy should be observed more closely.Systemic hypertension - Increased risk of retinopathy ( DR with superimposed hypertensive retinopathy ) Triglycerides and lipids - Normalization of lipid levels reduces retinal leakage and exudates deposition.Pregnancy - DR can progress rapidly in pregnant women , especially those with preexisting DR . Physical : Funduscopy under stereopsis and high magnification should be performed on every patient with diabetes to assess for DME and DR. An indirect ophthalmoscope does not provide adequate magnification for the ophthalmologist to diagnose DME.DME is defined as retinal thickening within 2 disc diameters of the center of the macula.Focal edema is associated with hard exudate rings resulting from leakage from microaneurysms.Diffuse edema results from breakdown of blood-retinal barrier with leakage from microaneurysms , retinal capillaries , and arterioles.CSME , as defined by the ETDRS , exists with any of the following findings : Retinal thickening within 500 mm of the center of the foveaHard , yellow exudates within 500 mm of the center of the fovea with adjacent retinal thickeningAt least 1 disc area of retinal thickening , any part of which is within 1 disc diameter of the center of the foveaOther physical findings that should be noted include the following : Visual acuity is an important parameter in following the progression of CSME , although it does not aid in the diagnosis of CSME because patients may have a visual acuity of 20/20.The status of the posterior hyaloid ; detached , taut , thickenedCauses : Causes include the following : After 20 years of the disease , nearly all patients with type I diabetes mellitus and 60 % of patients with type II diabetes mellitus will have some degree of retinopathy.Poor control of blood sugar increases the risk of diabetic retinopathy.Renal disease can be a marker for the development of diabetic retinopathy.Systemic hypertension increases the risk of diabetic retinopathy.Elevated lipid levels increase the risk of leakage and exudate deposits .",0

"16 year difference in age - college teacher/ former student . How long before it ends ? I am curious as to other 's ideas .

She knew he was married , and she was in lesbian relationship living with lover ; never been with man . Huge power differential , and she is still a student so he pays for all her living expenses in the apartment they share . She went from her female lovers place , where she dropped the bomb , to my ex 's new apartment in one day.Part of me feels that it was a mid-life crisis , but he invested so much he ca n't ever tell me so or apologize to me.Thoughts ? Know of similar prof/student relationships that worked long haul ? ? ? She could have been just struggling financially and looking for a sugar daddy . Or she might be serious about him , who knows .

"Are there other active geysers in the world besides Yellowstone 's Old Faithful ? Here is an excerpt from a great reference on Geysers : A geyser is a hot spring that periodically erupts , throwing water into the air . Though that sounds simple , geysers are extremely rare . As of December 2005 , the total of active geysers on earth number approximately 1000.Conditions must be just right for geysers to occur . Three components must be present for geysers to exist : an abundant supply of water , an intense source of heat , and unique plumbing . Water is common in nature , heat can come from volcanic activity , but the plumbing is critical . For water to be thrown into the air , geyser plumbing must be water- and pressure-tight . Geyser scientists and observers have identified the volcanic rock rhyolite as being particularly effective at hosting geysers . Rhyolite is high in silica , which can deposit a water-tight seal along the walls of the geyser plumbing . Most of the geyser fields in the world are found in rhyolite or similar silica-laden rocks ( like ignimbrite ) . The mixture of water , volcanic heat , and plumbing is exceptional at Yellowstone National Park . Over one-half of the world 's geysers are located within the park 's boundaries.It is increasingly apparent that geysers must possess a fourth characteristic to exist : remoteness . Within the last fifty years , volcanic heat and abundant water have been increasingly harnessed to turn turbines for electricity production . Geothermal energy can be produced at any site where volcanic heat and water are readily available . Unfortunately , geyser fields are ideal for this type of energy production . Geothermal energy production steals the geysers ' water , and destroys geyser activity ( for example , Wairakei , New Zealand ) . A growing threat to geysers stems from mineral extraction . Hot groundwater may precipitate gold or other valuable minerals , and extraction may require removing the geyser plumbing itself . For example , in May 2003 , mineral exploration at South America ’ s second largest geyser field ( Puchuldiza , Chile ) , caused cessation in the field ’ s geysers . Few realize the actual rarity of geysers . As a result , many geyser fields have been destroyed and many others are being threatened . LocationsYellowstone National Park ( USA ) Valley of Geysers , Kamchatka Peninsula ( Siberia ) El Tatio ( Chile ) North Island , New ZealandIcelandBeowawe Geyser Field , Nevada ( USA ) Steamboat Springs , Nevada ( USA ) Umnak Island , Alaska ( USA ) Other World GeysersAt least a dozen additional locations worldwide are known to contain between one and fourteen geysers .

"Preparing a Solution ? How many grams of ( NH4 ) 2SO4 are needed to produce 33.0 mL of a 0.150 M solution ?

"is super conductor becoming a reality ? Superconductors are a reality .

This has yet to happen because of thermodynamic restrictions , but superconductors of very high efficiency are currently in use in MRI machines and trains.Check out the website for more info .

"Heavy water what is the role that heavy water plays in the nuclear explosion process ? Heavy water is like regular water except that instead of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom ( H20 ) it has two deuterium atoms and an oxygen atom ( D20 ) . Deuterium is a hydrogen atom with an extra neutron.Water is used in nuclear reactors to moderate the reaction speed , and to absorb heat . Nuclear fission starts by giving off neutrons that create a chain reaction . Any water around it absorbs those neutrons ( becoming heavy water ) and slows the reaction . If heavy water is used instead of regular hydrogen water , the neutrons are not absorbed . This means that less pure nuclear material can be used to sustain a reaction . For example unrefined uranium , which is much less expensive , can be used instead of enriched uranium .",0

"Why does the days in the Georgian Calendar differ with the dates every year ? ? The traditional Chinese one isnt The traditional Chinese calendar does not contain “ weeks ” . In ancient China government officials enjoyed a day off for every ten days . The week system was introduced into China , I guess , only in early last century along with the Gregorian calendar . According to the Chinese calendar , a year has 12 months and a month has 29 or 30 days . If a month has 29 days , we call it the lesser month ; if 30 days – the greater month . Each of the 12 months of a certain year can be lesser or greater , depending on the astronomical calculation . There is no special name to each month ; they are identified by the ordinal numbers ( 1 to 12 ) . If you want to know , for example , whether the second month of the next Chinese year ( or lunar year ) is a lesser or greater one , you have to consult an almanac or a perpetual calendar . There is an intercalary month arranged for every three years ( approximately ) . An intercalary year has 13 months . That ’ s the outline of the Chinese calendar . And it may be obvious that the Chinese calendar can not match its dates to the week 's days .",0

"Can a state to state relationship turn in to a life long relationship together. ? Yes , it can . It depends on how hard you work at it , and how much they are working at it . You have to keep your commitments of calling when you promise , being on line when you promise , of coming down when you promise , and vice versa . Sometimes starting out in long distance relationships actually make them better . One reason is that you know from the beginning it is going to take work and are ready to take that on . Second , you learn to communicate verbally with each other on every topic , and that will last through your relationship if it leads to marriage . Also , it forces you to take things slow , and really get to know the person over time . Sometimes if we can see the person every day , we fall too fast , and fail to recognize the warning signs that we would see if there were some distance put between us . I know of a couple that dated from Scotland to Canada for two years , and just got married . You know what ?

"What are greenhouse conditions ? ? I 'm doing a biology research and I ca n't find anything on what greenhouse conditions are ! ! HELP ! ! I believe `` green house conditions `` are that which it is `` basically '' literly.A green house is a dwelling that is made of all glass , plastic , plexiglass of clear windows used for growing , sowing plants.The process of this glassis intended to allow as much heat , from sunlight that is possible.The reason it is an encloser isto create an evaporation process that stimulates plant life and keeps it moist and warm.Plants arereally quite self efficient basically.The plasma , water in plants themselves are enough to sustain them.But unfortunately typical weather conditions do not provide the best conditions for plant life .Most vegetable plants and desirable plants are what we call annual.Annual means they only grow and ripe within a specific season , usually fall or summer , ( when it is warm ) Perenial plants on the other hand re seed themselves and regrow every spring , like tulips or wild daisies.Greenhouses are a great benifit to man.We use green houses to propogate the plants especially vegetable plants .We eat vegetables everyday ! Millions of people rely upon `` Greenhouses '' for the perpectuation of `` our '' food supply.Greenhouse conditions are warm and moist.Take boiling water in a pot for example.You heatwater to a certain degree then it begins to evaporate.You can see this by the steam or watervapor the rises out of the pot.Now with a `` greenhouse '' The water gets warm eventually very concentrated warm and starts to arise.All water evaporates.This is the changing of liquid to vapor.Vapor is a gaseous substance , a `` green house '' islike an vapor barrier.The sealed encloser traps thismoister within the walls .The moister then fallsback down , creatin a perpectual cycle of water , theliquid of life !",0

"What should I do ? My ex-boyfriend and I have been having a on-again off-again relationship for 4 years . This past year we broke out again , he usually calls me at least 2 weeks later to try to patch things up but this time he did n't . I moved on a talked to this dude for 5 months and I just did not feel him like I did my ex , so I broke it off with him because I can not string people along that . I decided to call my ex . He did n't answer the phone , then about an hour later he called . He think that he was at work because we only talk for about 5 min . and he said that he would call me back . I was not expecting a call , but he did later that night . We talk for a little while catching up , but I could tell that he was tired and he told me he was about to go to sleep . He has n't called since . But yesterday when I was getting out of class he pulled up to my car and he really did not saying anything it was like we were talking in silent .

I still love him what to do It sounds like you too have a deep connection , he called you and you keep loving him and thinking about him plus you two talked `` in silence '' too its as if you have a body language connection as well.I think you two should try being together again , try another date and tell him how much you enjoy his company and his personality and how people make mistakes.that might bring him back too you.hope this helps .",0
"what are treadmills good for working out ? what do they tone up ? They 're good for your lower torso and your legs . That 's pretty much it . If you want a good OVERALL body workout , you 're going to have to incorporate your arms into the motion on the treadmill - light weights would work , or if it 's a NordicTrack - those work GREAT ! Of course , I 'm a bit biased , because I used to work at NordicTrack ... but I have to admit , I worked OUT when I worked there ; and I DID see improvement in my entire body . Thing is , most treadmills , you use your legs only . If you really want a great workout , and to really tone up your muscles ( meaning to lose baby fat , get ripped , no spare tire , no water retention , etc. , etc ... . ) you need an overall cardiovascular workout . While a treadmill is good for that , you should consider a workout that encompasses the entire body for that will tone you up so much faster than if you did it halfway.Besides ... when those exercise videos say they can help you tone up your abs , or build up a certain body part ... DO N'T fall for it ! ! It does n't work THAT way ! In order to lose weight from a CERTAIN area of your body , you have to lose it EVERYWHERE on your body ! You ca n't just lose it from just one section ... . unless you have liposuction done !",0

"If I use a mixture of a ten per cent of alcohol and a ninety per gasoline , does the octane increase its level ? Short answer : yes.Octane levels are based on what is called a `` knock resistance . '' When an engine burns gas , the smaller the gas molecules , the quicker it will burn . If it burns too quickly , the energy will be released faster than the piston can use the energy . The excess energy makes the piston rattle in the chamber , `` knocking '' back and forth -- if you 've ever heard a sound like rattling marbles in the engine of an old car climbing a hill , you know what I mean here.Octane is a hydrocarbon with eight carbon atoms ( hence the `` oct '' prefix ) . But gasoline that you get at the pump is not pure octane -- it contains some lighter stuff ( like hexane and septane ) and some heavier stuff ( like novane and decane ) . Plus , there are aspects of whether the molecules in the gas are in straight chains or in branched chains . But when a consumer buys gasoline , they need some sense of what they 're getting to make sure that they 're not getting crap that will burn too quickly and mess up their engine . So instead of trying to make all gas pure octane ( which would be ridiculously expensive and wasteful ) , or trying to give a consumer a detailed assay of the types of hydrocarbons in the gas ( which would be meaningless for the consumer and likewise expensive ) , they formulate the gas into certain knock ratios . The speed of burning is measured against 2,2,4-trimethylpentane ( a type of octane ) and n-pentane . So 87 octane gas knocks as much as a mixture of 13 % pentane and 87 % octane , etc . They compare the knocking effect.Ethanol helps to slow down the burning of the gas , and does work as an actane booster . The follwing link says that 10 % ethanol added to 92 octane will give an octane rating of 94.7 , but warns that ethanol is mildly corrosive to some engine parts .",0
"What ever happened to Romance ? When I romance a woman she does n't even know wht it is . Do you know what it is ? This is open to men and women I agree with you .

All of a sudden not having the albulm made you a loser , and having that albulm made you so `` punk rock '' Yeah , I like some , ok a few of their songs , if I do n't like one song ...

I 'm not gon na like them only because they 're so `` cool '' . Hell No.My opinionWho else feels the same ? My personal opinion as to why everyone is now a Green Day fan is that they have what is commonly reffered to as `` selling out '' . Large music lables dish out millions and millions to promote artists albums , and in return , get air time , national tours in large venues , and thier latest single played on Mtv ( the same corporation that tells you what to think , what to say , and what to listen to ) . It is because people are being force-fed this mainstream bullshit pop music , that people have infatuations with a particular group for an extended period of time . Also , to make more money for the record executives , bands sometimes release up to five singles off of just one album . This creates the illusion that the CD is doing well , and continues to place the band in the spotlight , in return , making more money . Bands with little or no talent ( Maroon 5 ) can ride an album for over 2 years without producing any new material .",0

"how long is ovalating and how do you know if your ovalation ? Ovulation always occurs during the middle of your cycle . Key things you can look for is a clear , slippery , elastic discharge that signals you are ovulating . If you have a basal thermometer you will also see a rise in your temperature . A good way to track when you are ovulating and whether you are fertile or not is to chart your cervical mucus and temperature . Another thing you can do is use an ovulation microscope which will show when you are ovulating . The best thing to do is to use software in which you can not only chart down your temp and mucus , but also other data including when you have had sexual relations . This software will calculate when your fertile and non-fertile days are , and is a good way to keep track of your periods . I always reccomend femta which is at www.femta.com and ovusoft which is at www.ovusoft.com",0

"How to protect yourself from the pain of love ? I avoided him for weeks because I just did n't feel an instant attraction or any chemistry . He was persistent and somehow broke through the brick wall . I fell for him and fell hard . He was everything I 'd asked God for - a Christian , strong , handsome , loving , caring and put me on a pedestal . I treated him like a prince , respected him , but held him accountable in the areas where he struggled ( something he said he wanted ) . Just when life could n't get any better , he decided that God was telling him to go back to his ex who treats him like crud . The joy was indescribable , but so is the pain ... and honestly , even moreso . I do n't think the chance of true love is worth the pain of rejection . How does one protect themselves from pain of this sort without isolating everyone and turning into the lonliest person in the world ? The pain of rejection is temporary . You feel it now because the wound is fresh . But wounds always get better with time . However bad it has been losing this guy for you , you will surely get over it . Because , pain is always temporary.Whereas , the joy of true love , when you do find it , is permanent . It is an eternal paradise . You have already had a glimpse of it . Just imagine how wonderful it would be if such a joy lasted forever . So dont think the pain is not worth bearing . It is . Not just once or twice but as many times it takes . Never lose faith in true love . Just because one person struck hollow , doesnt mean every other guy will . The only way to be happy is to believe that there is good and happiness and it is attainable.There is no way you can protect yourself from this sort of pain . It is a part of life . But so is the happiness . Someday it will be yours . All you have to do is hang in there , especially during the delicates moments like the ones you 're going through now . Dont lose hope.. the world is a beautiful garden with many wonderful flowers.You 'll find your rose . Time is all it takes .",0

The first one shoots to a fox and misses it by 5 inches on the right . In the same moment , the second one shoots to the same fox and misses it by 5 inches on the left . So they exclaim together : `` we got it ! `` .The moral of the story : statistics can help you making an idea of some ( not all ) of the phenomena which involve a large number of subjects ( in fact , the same name of the discipline comes from `` state '' , having been developed in the XVII-th century by Pascal and others in order to handle the administration of the raising modern states ) .It does not tell the truth about any single subject of the `` universe '' it studies.It does not promise any certainty about the answers it gives.Most importantly , as the joke teachs , you can not take your statistical projections as valuable in spite of the objectivity of real facts when they clearly appear under your eyes ! Having said this , it can be a useful tool if it is kept in its range of application.Moreover , it may help hunting get more likely to animals , as the probability that an expert in statistics really get one may be very very low !",0

"My cousin goes to a liberal arts school but wants to pursue marketing , what 's a good path ? My cousin is a freshman at Dartmouth and she 's expressed an interest in marketing as a career . Dartmouth does n't offer Marketing as a major so she was wondering what would be a good liberal arts degree to segue into marketing ? She 's also looking at some internships possibly after her sophomore year so any strategies for that would be welcome as well . From looking at the catalog , it seems like a combination of econ + cognitive science might be a good fit ... any thoughts ? I was in marketing for a few years , and my major in college was Communications with an emphasis in Business Administration . Many aspiring marketing people chose this major . Other relevant majors are English , Psychology , History , and Cog Sci . Whatever she takes , it will really help to minor or double-major in Business .

"do you believe in god ? I know there is a God . I did n't arrive at this conclusion by my intellect , for human intelligence is limited . Give up on trying to figure everything out , for common sense itself should tell you that you ca n't know or understand everything . This is not a matter of the head , but of the heart . Ask yourself this : `` If God is the truth , do I really want to know the truth ? '' Our sinfulness makes us afraid of a holy and righteous God who we feel must demand an accounting of us His creatures . Atheists say they do n't believe in God , but I do n't believe in atheists . If they do n't believe in God , then who are they so mad at ? They claim wisdom and knowledge and call believers simple , but I see atheists as being extremely smallminded and limited . Did atoms and microbes not exist until some human came along who was smart enough to detect them ? How small these people 's reality must be ! How futile and pointless their existence ! I commend you for at least being openminded enough to ask ? How foolish it is to think that one 's ignorance is evidence ! Thanks for not being that way , wisdom is not beyond the grasp of one such as yourself . There is a God ; He is beyond human comprehension ; He is absolutely holy , righteous , and frightfuly just . His awesome majesty and power is terrifying and he is completely unapproachable by vile , prideful humans . Remember I said that it is our innate sense of this reality that drives some to deny His existense out of fear of the truth . They ca n't face themselves and their guilt , and they ca n't face a righteously angry , holy , and just God whom they rightly think will demand retribution of them . What they do n't understand is that this same God is also infinitely loving , kind , gracious and merciful , and that He paid the penalty for their sins and removed their guilt which was keeping them from Him . How ? He gave us His only begotten Son Jesus Christ who took our sins and guilt upon his holy and innocent self and was put to death so that we may go free . Believe this , make claim to it as a FREE GIFT from God , confess it to Him and to others , then walk in peace from now on with Him , always trusting Jesus ' sacrifice as your justification in God 's eyes , not your own merit . Then keep on learning more of Him and growing spiritually. > < > Sir Brian",0

"some ink fell on a shirt . which ones are the best to remove the stain ethanol , vinegar or ethanol and vinegar ? Okay , here 's the real chemistry of how it works : Ink is an organic substance . Organic substances usually are n't charged . Vinegar , on the other hand , is a solution made of charged particles . For that reason , vinegar is good for removing things with charge , but probably wo n't do a good job with ink.I recommend ethanol . Actually , I 've used ethanol to remove ink lots of times , so I 'm pretty confident it 'll work.A bit of advice , though : when the ethanol dissolves the ink it might spread it out , making the spot bigger . The best advice I have for this is keep trying and test it in an inconspicuous area first if you ca n't bear to have a bigger spot on your shirt .",0

His best known model is Goals-Free Evaluation which supplements inherent weaknesses in a goals-oriented approach by providing an unbiased perspective of ongoing events . Developed in 1972 , this model in this model , the evaluator begins by examining outcomes of the program and attempts to infer the intended objectives from these observations.The evaluator then identifies and interviews actual participants rather than program management and staff .

"why are people so ignorant about the Pagan based religions or witchcraft ? Well , you are certain to get a bunch of Christians jumping on this one , which may be an answer in itself .

Remember the burning times ! ( i.e. , the inquisition . ) Also , I think many modern pagans , witches , wicca , ( use what term you will ) , believe that only a small percentage of people are capable of being a part of the pagan world : one might almost call it snobbery .

"Opinion of Marijuana v/s Alcoholic Beverages ? Should both be illegal or legal ? What are the differences to you ? Have you used both in your lifetime ? I find that alcohol seems to take whatever mood a person is in and magnify it ; so a person who is drinking in celebration becomes more exhuberant , the person who is drinking out of anger becomes more beligerant , and the person who is drinking out of depression sinks even lower . On the other hand , Marijuana typically mellows a person regardless of their mood going into it . It is common for people to become paranoid when using pot , especially with ongoing use . Both are used most often to relax and unwind ; but can become misused as a means to avoid problems . With both , the user builds a tolerance to the substance , so more and more is needed to have the desired effect with continued use . Both will alter the user 's perception and judgement.My opinion is that as long as cigarettes and alcohol are legal , there is no reason why marijuana should n't be -- it is no worse than either of those drugs . I do n't know from a medical/research standpoint , but it seems to me that alcohol is actually more harmful to the body than pot , and I believe that it is socially more harmful , because of the effects I 've observed that I noted above . If marjuana were legal , I would use it on a weekend night before watching a movie or something . In the past , I went through phases when I would smoke daily -- and it really saps motivation from a person . I used to drink , probably the most before I was of legal age . I got sick plenty of times . Now I do n't like the taste , and many alcoholic beverages actually give me a sinus/allergy attack . So it is rare for me to use either of these things now .",0

"Do you think children have a preference for one parent over another ? I was observing kids and their parents in a public location . I noticed the little girls were walking hand in hand with their father and the little boys were walking with their mother . I was wondering if boys tend to gravitate to their moms , while girls gravitate to their dads . I think parents tend to have a natural protection type sheild over the opposite sex offspring . Like a daddy and his little girl , there is nobody who can come in between them until sweet sixteen when daddy 's cleaning the shotgun , while mothers want their sons to turn out to be men of honor that women will want while he still has respect . I feel children will gravitate towards the nicer parents because their minds are so simple they respond to the parent who is nicer . If you left a jar full of sugar in front of a 4 year old it would be gone in a matter of minutes because they do n't know any reason why they should n't eat it all .

How much confidence can one place in an attorney to keep what they say to them private all the time , how much can the court change that ? What is the process for that ? Is it like a journalist priveledge to keep informants secrets or is there any such thing ? As long as an attourny is n't party to a crime they can not reveal anything said to them . If they do it is punishable under the law.Journalists and there sources have no such legal protection . If someone reveals something to a journalist that violates the law , the journalist can be compelled by law to reveal the source , if they do n't the journalist can be found in contempt of court",0

"Should NiCADS get hot when they are in use ? ( NOT WHEN CHARGING ) ? When using a Modified 6V nicad ( use to be 4.8V ) it becomes very hot..probly about +70C . the system it drives is designed to automatically shut down when supply voltage drops ( Unsure what to ) reciently tested and found the drop from the 6V was as followsFully Charged = 7.55VShut down voltage = 5.89VHowever i have not modified the system in which it is used for so how is it that it is shutting down before the standard nicad voltage of 4.8V ? Have placed the Nicad in the freezer to see if dropping the temperature will allow me to re use the nicad in the system . Please help electronics ar n't my thing NiCads in general electronic applications are typically designed to NOT get hot , since the heat destroys the NiCad battery , can damage electronics and causes lawsuits when users get burned from the hot battery . Some devices like radio-controlled cars are high-drain applications that generate a lot of heat , so the batteries for these devices are designed for their specific use.Batteries get hot when they charge due to the high current going into them . The faster they charge , typically the hotter they get . When the battery discharges during use , the same thing happens , the battery gets hotter as more current is drawn from the battery . Without knowing anything else , my guess is that high current draw from the battery cells is causing them to heat up . This can be due to a defective battery , a battery not designed for the way you are using it or your modification damaged the battery or is otherwise causing excessive current drain.Also , increasing the supply voltage can drive more current through the device , so it may just be that the higher voltage is drawing more current.I ’ m not sure how the device is shutting down , so I can ’ t say why it ’ s doing that . Note that the voltage at which a device stops working is the voltage seen by the device itself . If you remove the battery from the device and measure the voltage , you will get a different voltage than if you measure the voltage at the precise moment the device shuts down . This is especially true for high current drain applications , which appears to be what ’ s happening with your batteries . Placing the NiCad ’ s in the freezer wo n't help . They ’ ll have to warm up to work properly anyway .",0

"Why is American tax day on April 15th ? Who started the day and why is n't on that specific day ? And how many years has it been that way ? The Sixteen Amendment which allows the enforcement of taxes was passed by Congress on February 13 , 1913 . They chose March 1 , 1914 as the filing deadline for taxes . This deadline was changed to March 15 in 1918 , and in 1955 it was changed to April 15 . `` According to an IRS spokesman , the move `` spread out the peak workload , '' but there 's another explanation . Turns out that as the income tax applied to more of the middle class , the government had to issue more refunds . `` Pushing the deadline back gives the government more time to hold on to the money , '' says Ed McCaffery , a University of Southern California law professor and tax guru . Still , the IRS 's rigidity works in your favor : By law , it must mail your refund within 45 days or pay you interest . ''",0

"How is Iron ore mined ? Modern mines , in Minnesota and Michigan in the US , and Eastern Canada mine taconite . Taconite is a term to describe magnetite ore that is very hard and fine-grained . Taconite must be first processed into iron oxide pellets by crushing and magnetic separation of the magnetite to concentrate the iron to about 66 % before it can be used in steel-making.Taconite mining involves moving tremendous amounts of ore and waste . The waste comes in two forms , bedrock in the mine ( mullock ) that is n't ore , and unwanted minerals which are an intrinsic part of the ore rock itself ( gangue ) . The mullock is mined and piled in waste dumps , and the gangue is separated during the beneficiation process and is removed as tailings . Taconite tailings are mostly the mineral quartz , which is chemically inert . This material is stored in large , regulated water settling ponds.In Australia iron ore is won from three main sources ; massive magnetite ore as at Savage River , Tasmania ; pisolite `` channel-iron '' ore derived by mechanical erosion of primary banded-iron formations and accumulated in alluvial channels such at Robe River , Western Australia ; and banded iron formation related ores such as at Newman , Hamersley and Koolyanobbing , Western Australia . Other types of ore are coming to the fore recently , such as oxidised ferruginous hardcaps , for instance iron ore deposits near Argyle , Western Australia.World production averages one billion metric tons of raw ore annually . The world 's largest producer of iron ore is the Brazilian mining corporation CVRD , followed by Australian companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto Group . China is currently the largest consumer of iron ore , which translates to be the world 's largest steel producing country . Iron ore is common worldwide , but commercial mining operations are dominated by the countries listed below : Estimated iron ore production in million tons for 2004 , according to U.S. Geological Survey [ 2 ] China 280 Australia 220 Brazil 220 India 110 Russia 95 United States 54 Ukraine 66 South Africa 40 Canada 31 Sweden 22 Venezuela 18 Kazakhstan 17 Iran 16 Mauritania 10 Mexico 12 Other countries 40 Total world 1250 [ edit ] RefiningPure elemental iron is virtually unknown on the surface of the Earth except as wüstite from meteorites and very rare forms of deep mantle xenoliths . Therefore , all sources of iron used by human industry exploit iron oxide minerals , the primary form which is used in industry being hematite.However , in some situations , more inferior iron ore sources have been used by industrialised societies when access to high-grade hematite ore was not available . This has included utilisation of taconite in the United State , particularly during World War II , and goethite or bog ore used during the Revolutionary war and the Napoleonic wars . Magnetite is often used because it is magnetic and hence easily liberated from the gangue minerals.Inferior sources of iron ore generally required beneficiation . Due to the high density of hematite relative to silicates , beneficiation usually involves a combination of crushing and milling as well as heavy liquid separation . This is achieved by passing the finely crushed ore over a bath of solution containing bentonite or other agent which increases the density of the solution . When the density of the solution is properly calibrated , the hematite will sink and the silicate mineral fragments will float and can be removed.Magnetite is beneficiated by crushing and then separating the magnetite from the gangue minerals with a magnet . This is usually so efficient that lower grade ore can be treated when it is magnetite than a comparable grade of hematite ore , especially when the magnetite is quite coarse.To convert an oxide of iron to metallic iron it must be smelted .",0

"I have a friend who I have been studying with and I think that she and I have a connection . Should I pursue it The two of us and another person have been studying all semester . Although I have felt a real connection , I am fearful of acting on it becaue I am afraid of ruining a friendship I really enjoy . We are both single parents , we have similar values and she is more beautiful than I can possibly describe . It seems that any excuse we can make to get together we do but i do not know if it is because we are both really stressed out , if it is a friendship thing or what.I am very confused and have been balancing between being transparent and being coy trying to gauge her reaction.Do I just wait and see what happens or do I take the bull by the horns and just tell her ? Go for it . Take the chance . Cause she might have the same feelings and you do n't know it . Maybe she is waiting for you to say something . So like I said go for it , Tell her that you felt a connection . You wo n't know till you try it . GOOD LUCK !",0

"has does alcohol and bipolar disorder effect each other ? Yes.If a person is taking medication for a bi-polar ailment , then the effects of alcohol can not be adequately surmised on the behavioral aspects of the person in question . It can lead into manic highs or lows , or just disassociate that individual from reality.If the person is not on medications , it can do the same . However , more vividly and progressively animated . Alcohol , being a depressant , usually has the affect on this type of individual as making them reach their `` lows '' , and they can be quite violent and destructive.Anyone with bi-polar disease should ALWAYS be careful on ANY medications injested . This comes from some aspirins containing stimulants , cough syrup ( hypertension effect ) , etc.Anyone on Zoloft , Paxil , or any other seratonin reuptake meds are advised strongly to avoid alcohol.Consult with a physician on this matter -- do n't waste time on the 'net !",0

Will it increase , decrease , or stay the same . Interesting scenario first of all i would like to comment . Well actually the bond is due to electronic forces .

"Why are so many blacks calling each other the N-word when they hate it so much ? Seems like a double standard. ? Even the mayor of New Orleans called it a `` chocolate '' city . From my perspective , it has nothing to do with any one person or group finding a term `` offensive . '' It has everything to do with wanting POWER.One form or POWER is the `` double standard , '' in which one group of people can engage in some activity or speech which another group can not . There have been double standards since the dawn of time , and to this day , you will hear women complain about the double-standards about men 's sexual behavior and their general assertiveness as compared to that of women . A newer incarnation of the double standard is political correctness , in which one group of people attempt to control and limit the words or thoughts of another.When one group can effectively limit the ability of of another to do the same , the first group `` feels '' a sense of control or power . I say `` feels '' because any such quest for power , based in the desire to forbid another person from saying a particular 6-letter word is a misguided and inconsequential exertion of power . it really changes nothing ( at least in the short term ) . About the only thing it accomplishes is inflicting a sense of guilt on the intended target . If you 're motivated by guilt , it has worked . In the scheme of things , it 's minor . You can choose to fight it if you want , but to do so involves incurring the wrath of a politcally-correct society , who has accepted , for whatever reason , the argument from the messenger that this restriction should be enforced , not legally , but socially , via scorn , derision and ostracization . That may mean losing friends , losing your job , or quite possibly losing points on Yahoo Answers ( or even your entire account ) .So that 's the way I see it . And If the people who are trying to control the speech , be they black or female , or whatever , really look at it objectively , they ca n't help but admit that there 's a grasp for a modicum of power involved .",0

"Instant Fire - Just Add Water ? I thought of this out of the blue and I was wondering if it would actually work ( in priciple ... I realize that there are a lot of engineering hurdles to overcome ) .Take powdered potasium and powdered magnesium . Add a little water . The water and potasium will react , producing heat and hydrogen . The heat will ignite the hydrogen which , in turn will will ignite the magnesium ... instant fireWill this actually work ? MistWing SilverTail adding water to potassium already causes it to explode . you are correct - the reaction releases hydrogen and forms an oxide of potassium , and the considerably exothermic nature of the reaction generates enough heat to ignite the hydrogen gas . so , mixing water and potassium solid typically causes a big-time explosion - just like mixing water and sodium.as for the powdered magnesium in there - i suspect that the explosion would scatter it , and it might ignite - the ignition temperature for magnesium metal is 450 C - so you 'd probably end up with white-hot burning magnesium shrapnel flying everywhere ! so , if you 're ever thinking about making a nasty bomb , sounds like a good way to do it .",0

When you look at a jacket you 'll see what I 'm talking about.Another thing to keep you dry is the little sock things on the sleves of the jacket .

I know , when you take a shower every day you wash your hair everyday ( at least mostly every day ) , but how often should you REALLY be washing your hair ? I mean , can shampoo damage your hair if used too often ? Oddly enough , yes , it can damage your hair . Your hair , if washed too often , can be stipped of it 's natural oils and vitamins by shampoos . True that conditioner does help this to some degree , but not entirely.As for how often , it really depends on the person 's hair type .

"what is ... ? What is Scienctology ( sp.. sorry ) I just recently heard that term used for a type of religion , I was courious to know if anyone new what it was or what it is about ... thanks Hi , here are a few detailsScientology is a system of beliefs , teachings and rituals , originally established as a secular philosophy in 1952 by science-fiction author L. Ron Hubbard , then recharacterized by him in 1953 as an `` applied religious philosophy . `` Scientology is officially represented by the controversial Church of Scientology . The Church presents itself as a non-profit religious organization dedicated to encouraging development of the human spirit . Providing counseling and rehabilitation programs , the Church offers itself as an alternative to psychiatry , which Scientologists believe to be a barbaric and corrupt profession . [ 1 ] ( http : //www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/heritage/pg011.html ) Church spokespeople attest that Hubbard 's teaching ( called `` technology '' or `` tech '' ) has freed them from drug and alcohol addictions , depression , learning disabilities , mental disorders and other problems.Scientology , however , has been the object of many allegations that sharply contradict the Church 's self-description . Critics—including officials and the courts of several countries—have characterized the Church of Scientology as an unscrupulous commercial organization ; it has often been described not as a religion , but a man-made cult that harasses its critics and exploits its members . Many of the Church 's most controversial actions are , critics argue , a direct reflection of Hubbard 's Scientology teachings.Origins of ScientologyScientology was expanded and reworked from Dianetics [ 2 ] ( http : //www.neuereligion.de/ENG/Wolf/pg6.htm ) , an earlier system of self-improvement techniques originally set out by Hubbard in the 1950 book , Dianetics : The Modern Science of Mental Health . Immediately prior to this work , Hubbard was intensively involved with the occultist Jack Parsons in performing the occult rites developed by Aleister Crowley . Some critics have seen many similarities in Hubbard 's writings to the doctrines of Crowley [ 3 ] ( http : //www.xenu.net/archive/lrhbare/lrhbare08.html ) .By the mid-1950s , Hubbard had relegated Dianetics to being a sub-study of Scientology , although it is still promoted and delivered by Scientology organizations . The chief difference between the two is that Dianetics is explicitly secular , focused on the individual 's present life and dealing with physical and mental or emotional problems , whereas Scientology adopts a more overtly religious approach [ 4 ] ( http : //victorian.fortunecity.com/finsbury/124/last.htm ) focused on dealing with spiritual issues spanning multiple past lives as well as the present day.Hubbard was repeatedly accused of adopting a religious facade for Scientology in order for the organization to maintain tax-exempt status and avoid prosecution for false medical claims ; these accusations have dogged the Church of Scientology to the present day , bolstered by numerous accounts from Hubbard 's fellow science-fiction authors that on various occasions he stated that the way to get rich was to start a religion [ 5 ] ( http : //www.bible.ca/scientology-1million-start-a-religion.htm ) .The word scientology has a history of its own . Although nowadays associated almost exclusively with Hubbard 's work , it was coined by the philologist Alan Upward in 1907 as a synonym for `` pseudoscience '' . [ 6 ] ( http : //www.instinct.org/texts/bluesky/bs3-4.htm ) In 1934 , the Argentine-German writer Anastasius Nordenholz published a book using the word positively : Scientologie , Wissenschaft von der Beschaffenheit und der Tauglichkeit des Wissens , or Scientology , Science of the Constitution and Usefulness of Knowledge . [ 7 ] ( http : //www.scientologie.de/scientologie/index.htm ) Nordenholz 's book is a study of consciousness , and its usage of the word is not greatly different from Hubbard 's definition , `` knowing how to know '' . However , it is not clear to what extent Hubbard was aware of these earlier usages . The word itself is",0

"How points in stock exchange has been calculated ? Are you talking about the Dow Jones Industrial Average ?

Since that time , in order to maintain consistency , it has changed stocks and the number of stocks so that it is no longer a simple average or sum of the stocks contained in it . For each stock listed in the DJIA , each is multiplied by a fractional number to get it 's value for the whole . These numbers are then added up and posted as the number of points the Dow is worth . Changes are mentioned daily in news broadcasts by saying the dow went up 5 points or down 10 points -- just the change in the daily figure .",0

"What are the basic differences that separate Roman Catholicism and Protestantism ? I think a major difference is that Protestants believe that you can not get to heaven on your own merit , that you must confess your sins and trust in Jesus as God 's son who died as a sacrifice for your sins ; they believe that you can not avoid sin on your own , that you must rely on Jesus as a redeemer , but that you will want to do good works out of appreciation for God 's salvation through Jesus . I think that Roman Catholics believe that you must acknowledge that Jesus is God 's son , but also that you have to do good works to get to heaven.From what I understand , Protestants believe that you can/should directly ask Jesus to forgive your sins , while Roman Catholics believe that you can/should confess your sins to a priest , who will in turn be your `` intercessor '' to Jesus/God . Also , Protestants believe that only Jesus/God/Holy Spirit are holy and that the Virgin Mary ( Jesus ' mother ) or other `` saints '' are just regular people , saved by God 's grace/Jesus . Roman Catholics believe that the Virgin Mary and other `` saints '' are holy , and can be prayed to for miracles or forgiveness.For the most part , I think that Protestants believe that when you die , you will go to heaven or hell . Roman Catholics believe that you might go to purgatory ( where you are `` purged '' of your sins before you get into heaven ) . I think there 's also `` Limbo , '' which is a place where babies can go if they have n't been able to comprehend the choice between heaven and hell.There are , of course , a lot of different divisions within Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths , so a lot of these are generalizations , and will not necessarily apply to a Protesant or Roman Catholic person 's personal beliefs .",0

"what is the chemical structure of the spider 's net ? The dragline silk of the Golden Orb-Weaving spider is the most studied in scientific research .

These are all proteins which provide structure . The protein in dragline silk is fibroin ( Mr 200,000-300,000 ) which is a combination of the proteins spidroin 1 and spidroin 2 . The exact composition of these proteins depends on factors including species and diet . Fibroin consists of approximately 42 % glycine and 25 % alanine as the major amino acids . The remaining components are mostly glutamine , serine , leucine , valine , proline , tyrosine and arginine . Spidroin 1 and spidroin 2 differ mainly in their content of proline and tyrosine .",0

"Does conditioner damage hair ? Does regularly using conditioner contribute to alopecia ( receding harline ) ? *Noddling solemnly* While many disagree I have to say yes , chemicals ( even in conditioners and shampoos ) can damage hair . One should only wash their hair often enough to keep it clean . Daily doses can over do it , especially if you use the rinse and repeat method.Now I can not say if this is the cause of your problem , but beware products that contain alcohol or lauryl sulphate as they dry out hair and make it brittle.Most people routinely lose between 70 and 150 hairs from their scalp each day , mainly through washing , brushing , and combing.Scalp hair starts to thin when more hairs are lost through normal shedding than the scalp is able to renew . About 40 % of the density of scalp hair has to be lost before thinning of the hair becomes noticeable.Hair loss can be caused by : * Heredity . Most balding is caused by a genetic predisposition - in other words , it 's part of a person 's genetic makeup . This is called male pattern baldness , or hereditary balding or thinning . It is the most common cause of thinning hair . * Illness , certain physical conditions , or their treatments . This can include high fever , thyroid disease , childbirth , inadequate protein in the diet , iron deficiency , cancer treatments , the use of certain medications , and other causes.For more see http : //www.ehealthmd.com/library/hairloss/HL_whatis.htmlSome good alternatives are found here http : //www.answerbag.com/c_view.php/1654",0

Consider the fact that it is compressed air generated by hot exhaust gases which turn the vane in the turbo . By cooling the air generated by the turbo , you can increase the power capability . You can research air/air intercoolers and even water/ice/air intercoolers on yahoo search.To answer your question , yes you could install one but you would likely see no performance gain and maybe even a drop . This is due to the additional volume added to the intake tract by the piping and intercooler itself . Your best bet is a cold air intake which you can buy from most any aftermarket parts place .",0

"What happened to Sayuri 's sister in Memoirs of a Geisha ? Do they ever explain ? ( Are they setting us up for a sequel ? ? ? hehe ) I assume you 've only seen the movie . After her sister ran away , she went back to the fishing village that they came from . Finding mother and father dead she had no place to stay there and ran away with the guy she had been seeing before they were taken from their home , Mr. Tanaka 's ( the guy who suggested the girls be sold ) assistant 's son . Sayuri learns this in the letter from Mr. Tanaka that came with the altar tablets from her parents.I do n't think there will be a sequel as Sayuri pretty much resigned that she would never see her sister again , and she really was n't mentioned after we learned this . After running away , her sister would 've been very poor and without the capability to be reunited with her . We can only assume what happened to Satsu and the assisstant 's son .",0

"what do you think about eurotrip ? I think Eurotrip is a great comedy and I take it like that - not to seriously . The fact is that it 's a lot misleading . Even though they travelled through the whole Europe , almost the entire movie has been shot in Prague , Czech Republic . But the worst thing was the part where they visited Slovak Republic and Bratislava . I come from Slovakia and the whole image of the country in Eurotrip was very insulting . It looked like the country is still in middle ages . And the fact that they lived in luxury and comfort for one or two dollars is a total bullshit . Bratislava is one of the most expensive cities in Central Europe and in the entire EU . For two dollars you would not even get a coffee in the downtown . And that kind of hotel they staid in would cost about $ 100 dollars per one night or more . My point is that when someone presents our country in such way it really hurts us since it 's miles from the truth . People should know what they are putting inside of the movie and be very careful with that since they are risking the whole public opinion on the country . Slovakia is a member of Europian Union with the fastest growing economy . By two years it will be the largest car producer per capita in the whole world and according to the World Bank it was rated as the most reformed contry in the year 2004 .

"Help Me Please ! Algebra no understand ! ? How do you find the slope of an linear equation your help would be great ! The slope , as it was taught to me simply long ago is just this : `` The rise over the run . '' What this means is the distance of the 'y ' coordinate , divided by the distance of the 'x ' coordinate.To give an example that 's a little more easy to grasp , consider walking up a flight of stairs . Measure the distance from the bottom floor to the floor at the top of the stairs , that height is your 'rise ' . Now , measure the distance between the first stair on the flight and the last stair that was climbed horizontally , and that is your 'run'.Once you have those two measurements , you can calculate the slope by dividing the height of the floor above by the length taken up by the stairs to get there . Draw the stairs as a right triangle.The right side is the rise , the bottom is the run , and the 'hypotenuse ' is the square root of the sum of both . The 'slope ' , is the right side divided by the bottom .",0

"can someone explain the cell cycle to me in english please ... . ? my bio teacher makes no sense at alll ... . The cell cycle , or cell division cycle , is the cycle of events in a eukaryotic cell from one cell division to the next . It consists of interphase , mitosis , and usually cell division . The cell cycle is regulated by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases . Leland H. Hartwell , R. Timothy Hunt , and Paul M. Nurse won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of these central molecules in the regulation of the cell cycle.The phases of the cell cycle are : The G0 phase is a period in the cell cycle where cells exist in a quiescent state . The G1 phase is the first growth phase . S phase , during which the DNA is replicated , where S stands for the Synthesis of DNA . G2 phase is the second growth phase , also the preparation phase for the cell . M phase or mitosis and cytokinesis , the actual division of the cell into two daughter cells . A surveillance system , so-called `` checkpoints '' , monitor the cell for DNA damage and failure to perform critical processes . Checkpoints can block progression through the phases of the cell cycle if certain conditions are not met . For instance , there is a checkpoint which monitors DNA replication and keeps cells from proceeding to mitosis before DNA replication is completed . Similarly , the spindle checkpoint blocks the transition from metaphase to anaphase within mitosis if not all chromosomes are attached to the mitotic spindle.If this system senses a problem , a network of signaling molecules instructs the cell to stop dividing . They can let the cell know whether to repair the damage or initiate programmed cell death , a form of which is called apoptosis . Programmed cell death ensures that the damaged cell is not further propagated . For example , a certain protein , called p53 , acts to accept signals provoked by DNA damage . It responds by stimulating the production of inhibitory proteins that then halt the DNA replication process . Without proper p53 function , DNA damage can accumulate unchecked . A direct consequence is that the damaged gene progresses into a cancerous state . Today , defects in p53 are associated with a variety of cancers , including some breast and colon cancers.Some cells , such as neurons , never divide once they become locked in a G0 phase . However , recent data has shown that neurons undergoing cell death re-enter the cell cycle . Addition of cell cycle inhibitors prevent this type cell death called apoptosis .",0
"what do high heel shoes do to your posture ? i saw it on CSI it does something really bad but i forgot what High heels do WONDERS for your posture ! The heel is actually used by many women to force them to stand taller , straighter , and with their shoulders back .

Your knee joints suffer when you wear heels and they 're not great for your back either . In the long run , I suppose this might hurt your posture , but not immediatly .",0
"What is a post-masters graduate certificate ? I have found a school that offers a post-masters graduate certificate . They say it is almost as good as a PHD . Any suggestions The post-masters graduate certificate is a degree level that is intermediate between the masters degree and the doctorate . It became popular in education careers where promotions or job grades depended in part on educational level . They recognized this `` sixth year '' degree level as one year of study beyond the master 's degree . You also sometimes see it referred to as a `` specialist 's '' degree because some of the early post-masters degrees were Educational Specialist ( Ed.S . ) degrees . Other common names are Certificate of Advanced Study or Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study . The utility of the post-masters certificate depends on what field you are in and why you want the degree . Some fields of study have the specialist level as the entering level for certification or licensure ( school psychology , for example ) , in which case you would find it vital . Some fields ( counseling , for example ) might have the level of training required for licensure at the equivalent of the post-masters certificate level ( 60 semester hours ) in which case having the certificate would be an advantage if you want to get licensed . Some fields allow you to specialize after taking a post masters certificate ( i.e . Infant Mental Health Nursing ) in which case the certificate is very useful . On the other hand , some fields really require a doctorate ( most college teaching , for example ) in which case the post-masters certificate , while good to have , wo n't fulfil the occupational requirement.I think the post-masters certificate is nice if you are working toward continuing education as it can help you make a more systematic study in your area of interest , and it appears that you have met a more unified goal than just taking courses.Hope this helps .",0

Practice in front of people ( and get feedback ) , practice to a mirror.6 . If memorization is necessary , memorize it like the back of your hand .

"Generator sizing ? I have a welder which is a 150amp and i need a generator which can run this power . can some one tell me of what kVA im going to need for this , i believe that 45kVA would be okay but can some one see if im right . alternatively can you tell me the Watts that would be needed on a 230V single phase system . I have used the following link to check some data but im not sure if this is correcthttp : //www.jobsite-generators.com/power_calculators.htmlThanks for your help . You are correct that 45kVA would be 150 AMPs . You probably should think about oversizing the generator for the surge that happens when the welder is first turned on . The 45KVA is for 230 for 110 volts you would need half of the 45KVA or 22.5KVAAt least that is the way it calculated for me using those tools.So pretty much you need a generator that can deliver 150 amps .

"How would you react to this famous speech by Keith Green ?

"What is the problem for scientists in explaining `` phantom limb '' ? The problem is that the brain is receiving signals , usually pain , that it thinks are coming from nerves that have been removed , by amputation , injury , or whatever reason . ( Phantom pain also occurs in the form of phantom tooth aches in people who have had all of their teeth removed . ) The question is where do the signals that the brain is receiving come from . There are several steps involved in getting a signal from the source , the sensory nerve ending , to the brain . The system of communication is so complex in the nervous system , it is hard to track exactly how the signal progresses through the body . Where the signal starts is unclear , because it can not start at the nerve ending .",0

"how do you remve genital warts ? thank you ? What are Condyloma ? Condylomata acuminata or genital warts are fleshy growths which appear in the genital area . They are caused by HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS ( HPV ) and are usually spread by sexual contact . Symptoms and Diagnosis . Genital warts first appear as small pink or red bumps on the vulva ( lips of the vagina ) , vagina , cervix , penis shaft , urinary opening or rectum . They are usually painless , but some people may have itching , burning or slight bleeding from these areas . The time between exposure to the virus and the appearance of warts is not known . It could be anywhere from several weeks to several years before symptoms occur . Because of this , it is had to tell when and where you were exposed to the virus . Sometimes vaginal infections and pregnancy can cause warts to grow and spread . One study showed that 20 % of women with genital warts also had a vaginal infection . Unless that infection is treated , the warts may not go away . Warts may spread up inside the vagina and on the cervix . They may also cause abnormal Pap smears . During pregnancy warts may be treated so they do not spread or grow larger . In men , warts may spread inside the penis causing problems when they urinate . The diagnosis of condylomata acuminata is usually made by a health care provider simply inspecting the genital area . Occasionally , they may want to remove a wart and send it to the lab for further tests . Because genital warts are a sexually transmitted disease other tests may be done for other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea , Chlamydia , syphilis , HIV and hepatitis . Treatment.Genital warts are frustrating for you to have and frustrating for doctors to treat . Some warts will disappear on their own . Others may come and go despite vigorous treatment . One of the most important things you can do is to KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENTS ! The treatment is easier when the warts are small and few in number . There is no one magic treatment for genital warts . Many methods may be tried depending on where , how large and how long the warts have been there . Certain chemicals may be applied to smaller warts on moist areas . The most common chemical used is called TRICHLOROACETIC ACID ( TCA ) . TCA is a clear , watery liquid that is painted on the warts . It causes a burning sensation as it dries . The warts will turn a whitish color , shrink and disappear . It will take weekly treatments for a number of weeks to get rid of the warts . Another chemical , PODOPHYLLIN , is a brown liquid that may also be used . It also causes a burning sensation as it dries . It must be washed off with soap and water 4 to 6 hours after it has been applied . In certain circumstances , a preparation of this medication may be applied by the patient at home . If TCA and PODOPHYLLIN do not work , the doctor may try freezing the wart with a treatment called CRYOTHERAPY , treating the affected area with topical 5FU CREAM , or performing laser surgery . Occasionally , INTERFERON injections are used if all other methods of treatment have failed . None of the treatments mentioned here are a guarantee that the warts will never come back . Once the wart virus ( HPV ) is in the skin , genital warts may occur again and again . This may require numerous visits to the doctor and many months of treatment . We know this can be very discouraging , but remember -- warts are easier to treat when they are small and few in number . KEEP THOSE APPOINTMENTS ! If the condyloma do not respond to treatment , your doctor may refer you to the Colposcopy Clinic . There your vulva or cervix will be examined through a special scope that magnifies the area . Tissue samples ( biopsies ) may be taken for further study . The doctors can then recommend further treatment options . PreventionThere are two ways to prevent getting warts : Use condoms during sex . Protect yourself . Celibacy - not having sex . If you have warts : Avoid sexual contact during treatment . If your warts are recurrent or you have a",0
"mendelssons traditional wedding march was first played at whos wedding , and what yr ?

However it did not become popular at weddings until it was selected by Victoria , The Princess Royal for her marriage to the Crown Prince of Prussia on January 25 , 1858.The organ on which the Wedding March was allegedly composed is housed in St Ann 's Church Tottenham .",0

"Where is the gum ? I was told that my gum is healthy if I can see less than 4mm of it . But I thought the gum is the flesh connecting the teeth to the jaw , and I can see the entire pink flesh covering my teeth . There must be at least 1.5cm . How can it be less than 4mm ? Am I missing something ? The 4 mm probably refers to the depth of your gum pockets ( the space betwen the top of your gums to the alveolar bone that holds your teeth . Your dentist would measure this with a probe.If your pockets are deeper than 4 mm then it means that you have had bone loss which is usually caused by periodontal disease ( an infection in the gums ) . The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly ( brush at least twice a day for two minutes ) . I emphasize flossing , because often people do n't realize just how important it is . The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck , and therefore where bacteria sticks most often , too . The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch . So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth , you want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure you remove the plaque . So you should be going up and down two to three times along the tooth on both sides of the contact.Hope this helps !",0

"Is salvation for the jews only ? According to Judaism , all the righteous in the world , Jewish or not , have their portion in the world to come.First and foremost , Jews believe strongly in the concept of Chasedei Umos Haolam ( lit . Righteous People of the Nations of the World ) that they are abundantly and lavishly rewarded for their good deeds . So , according to the jewish view , salvation is truly for every good-doer or do-gooder in the world , regardless of faith or heritage.However , for a more in depth discussion , this question is quite tricky . First and foremost , the term `` salvation '' or in hebrew , Yeshua , does not relate to personal salvation , heaven or hell etc.It is not an individualistic concept , but is more specifically used in reference to deliverance from exile , a future messianic era where moshiach , lit . meaning `` an anointed one '' , will bring peace to the world and lead the entire jewish nation to congregate in israel at the future third temple . While there is no temple , the jews are considered a scattered people . This future period is a time of peace for everyone . It is not exclusionary . The world will presumably be business as usual . But people , enlightened by a high ethical and moral understanding , will get along better with each other . And war and strife and fear will not be a staple of daily life ( as they are now , during this period of exile ) . Thus it will be a time of deliverance from persecution and plague for everyone alike.As for going to heaven vs. hell , judaism teaches us not to focus our energies on this aspect of existence so that we do n't constantly think about getting rewarded ( see ethics of our fathers ) . And rather do good deeds for the sake of doing good deeds.All in all , according to judaism , if you 're a good person , you 're going to heaven !",0

I loved it ! The teacher was amazing ... ... and related to each of us on such a personal level . The hilarious part was that it was one of those huge lecture type classes with over 200 people . Yet , she had this way of making it seem like she was talking straight to you . We would all be working problems and laughing and poking fun at our silly mistakes instead of feeling like we were losers for screwing up . Her tests were monstrously hard , but I ended up with an `` A '' in the course . Shows you what amazing teaching skills mixed with personable skills can do for students . I loved this question ... ... I 'm so glad you asked it . I have n't thought of her in so long . I really should go find her and tell her thanks sometime !",0

"when was asthma first discovered ? The word asthma is derived from the Greek aazein , meaning “ sharp breath. ” The word first appears in Homer 's Iliad ; [ 2 ] Hippocrates was the first to use it in reference to the medical condition . Hippocrates thought that the spasms associated with asthma were more likely to occur in tailors , anglers , and metalworkers . Six centuries later , Galen wrote much about asthma , noting that it was caused by partial or complete bronchial obstruction . Moses Maimonides , an influential medieval rabbi , philosopher , and physician , wrote a treatise on asthma , describing its prevention , diagnosis , and treatment . [ 3 ] In the 17th century , Bernardino Ramazzini noted a connection between asthma and organic dust . The use of bronchodilators started in 1901 , but it was not until the 1960s that the inflammatory component of asthma was recognized , and anti-inflammatory medications were added to the regimen . `` It was Hippocrates ( 460-357 BC ) , the Greek physician , who first described asthma and its resulting 'spasms ' . Galen ( 130-201 BC ) , a Greco-Roman doctor , discovered that asthma was due to bronchial obstruction . He treated it with owl 's blood in wine . `` Italian physician Bernardino Ramazzini described a link between his patient 's asthma and their jobs as far back as the early 1900s . `` Until the late 1800s , the most popular method of delivering asthma medication into the lungs was smoke . `` In 1864 , Dr.Henry Hyde Salter identified animal dander as an asthma trigger . `` In 1901 , a Japanese scientist , Jokici Takamine , purifies adrenaline , found in the suprarenal glands of sheep ( discovered in 1898 ) and develops the first effective bronchodilator . `` In the 1960s , asthma researchers discovered that asthma is an inflammatory disease , not just constriction of the airways , and that asthma sufferers have a sensitive immune system which reacts to airborne allergens . The first inhaled anti-inflammatory medication is born . `` In 1972 , inhaled corticosteroids hit the market . `` - Fraser Health",0

"What is Islam and why is Islam ? What is Islam ? Islam is not a new religion , but the same truth that God revealed through all His prophets to every people . For a fifth of the world 's population , Islam is both a religion and a complete way of life . Muslims follow a religion of peace , mercy , and forgiveness , and the majority have nothing to do with the extremely grave events which have come to be associated with their faith.Who are the Muslims ? One billion people from a vast range of races , nationalities and cultures across the globe - from the southern Philippines to Nigeria - are united by their common Islamic faith . About 18 % live in the Arab world ; the world 's largest Muslim community is in Indonesia ; substantial parts of Asia and most of Africa are Muslim , while significant minorities are to be found in the Soviet Union , China , North and South America , and Europe.What do Muslims believe ? Muslims believe in One , Unique , Incomparable God ; in the Angels created by Him ; in the prophets through whom His revelations were brought to mankind ; in the Day of Judgement and individual accountability for actions ; in God 's complete authority over human destiny and in life after death . Muslims believe in a chain of prophets starting with Adam and including Noah , Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob , Joseph , Job , Moses , Aaron , David , Solomon , Elias , Jonah , John the Baptist , and Jesus , peace be upon them . But God 's final message to man , a reconfirmation of the eternal message and a summing-up of all that has gone before was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through Gabriel.What does 'Islam ' mean ? The Arabic word 'Islam ' simply means 'submission ' , and derives from a word meaning 'peace ' . In a religious context it means complete submission to the will of God . 'Mohammedanism ' is thus a misnomer because it suggests that Muslims worship Muhammad rather than God . 'Allah ' is the Arabic name for God , which is used by Arab Muslims and Christians alike .",0

"how small can you get a mp3 song and how would you do it ? when i rip songs from cds ( about 4 min songs ) they can be from 3-8mb can i make them smaller but not wreck the sound quality.and will the music work on an mp3 player mp3 is a compression of your music . The standard is from CD to 128 kbit/s w/ cd quality being 1400 kbit/s . To make smaller , you compress more and therefore take away quality ( details are taken out to compress . ) There are other compression formats to use , but by definition they all compress the info and therefore lose quality . Try 96 kbit/s and see if you notice a difference . ( This will be found in the recording media ; ie . the program that `` rips '' CD to mp3 . ) Again 128 is standard for not noticing quality loss . VBR is a good choice . It breaks the songs into segments so that low quality sections can have lower bit rate . Set VBR from 96-128 .",0
"What type of rocks are usually taken from quarries ? Any type of rock or mineral ore can be quarried if the deposit is close enough to the surface of the earth . Most quarry operations are for limestone and dolomite in the US . The primary product of quarries is what is called 'natural aggregates ' which most people just call gravel . Of the natural aggregates produced in the US , 71 % are limestone and dolomite , 15 % are granite , and 8 % is from gabbro , basalt and diabase . The remaining 6 % is sandstone , quartzite , marble , slate , shell , and volcanic cinder and scoria . These statistics are from the USGS . Coal strip mines and iron and copper open pit mines are generally not called quarries , but are very much the same in that they dig into the earth in open holes to recover minerals . Here is the link to the USGS study : http : //nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/a_aggregates.html",0

"Why US try to develop a democratic power in IRAQ when they will never be a democratic nation ? Who is to say that IRAQ will not be a democratic nation . Even the USSR was democratic in the truest sense and meaning of the word , the people could vote , problem was there was only one person they could vote for.Oil has NOTHING to do with the war in IRAQ . I wo n't even get into why but the war would be in Saudi Arabia where the oil reserves are over twice the size of Iraq.We need to look back in history to see what has happened and the future looks bright for IRAQ . Success in Central America , Liberia , Korea , the new Russia , the slavic regions , and others have formed some type of democracy.The `` democracy '' that other countries enjoy are definately not the same as ours , but even a Monarchy like Morocco has a democratic government.Success in IRAQ will indeed depend on whether democracy becomes the new form of government when America finally does pull out or if there will be political chaos and insergency.Time will only tell.To correct a couple of the other writers above me ... The United States is NOT a democratic country , it is a Federal Republic . If indeed we were a true democracy Gore would be president not George Bush ( Gore won more of the popular vote but less of the electoral vote ) . So to say the US is the most democratic country in the world is absurd . Correct me if I am wrong but there is no country in the world that is truely democratic .",0

"I got my first speeding ticket after years of driving . I live in Layton Utah , What options do I have ? I was speeding in an industrial area . Clocked for 9 over the limit . I am trying to discover my options on how to settle this without points on my license . I 'm not disputing guilt , but I have a clean driving record which spans 35 years . Check with the city of Layton to see if they offer a traffic class . In lieu of going to court , most cities will off you a Plea In Abeyance . It 's essentially entering a guilty plea , paying a reduced fine , and agreeing to go to traffic class . You will have to pay for the traffic class seperately from the ticket amount . If you take the class then the points do n't appear on your license . If you do n't take the class , then you have to pay the full amount of the ticket and the points will be put on your license . It 's annoying to get a ticket but the class is n't too painful and it helps to brush up on your driving knowledge . Good luck and happy driving !",0

"what is Magic Flax ? Flax Is an Ancient CropFlax has been grown since the beginnings of civilization , and people all over the world have celebrated its usefulness throughout the ages . Cultivated flax , L. usitatissimum , is of two types : one is grown for the seed and the other for fibre production . In North America , it is primarily the oilseed varieties which are produced commercially.Historians weave the magic of flax into ancient history . Records show that the human race has eaten this seed since early times.About 3,000 B.C . Flax is cultivated in Babylon.Burial chambers depict flax cultivation and clothing from flax fibres.About 650 B.C . Hippocrates writes about using flax for the relief of abdominal pains.In the same era , Theophrastus recommends the use of flax mucilage as a cough remedy.About 1st Century A.D. Tacitus praises the virtues of flax.About 8th Century A.D.

"what is the best way to get money for college ? The first thing you need to know about money for college is that there are two kinds . Free and not free . In other words there are loans and scholarships . You want scholarships first and whatever is n't paid for by those can be covered with loans . To get scholarships some people think you have to be a `` straight A '' student or an exceptional athlete . Although those things do help , they are n't always necessary . You may have certain unique talents and abilities that can earn you scholarships regardless of your grades . Try visiting www.fastweb.com . You can use this site to make a profile and they will e-mail you scholarship opportunities that apply specifically to you ! Two kids from my high school won a scholarship for making their prom outfits out of duct tape ! True story ! Not all of the scholarships are that crazy but again , they do n't necessarily relate to grades or sports . If you do have good grades and/or play sports ; great ! Use that in your profile and they will send you opportunities that apply directly to your talents . It is totally free and there is no limit as to how many scholarships you can apply for and even win . So try to pay for everything you can with scholarships and then you may need to fill in some gaps with loans . Your next stop : www.fasfa.com . There you will apply for financial aid . You will need your most recent W-2 and your parents help when you apply . If you do n't have parents or you are over 24 years of age you get to skip the parent section . This site may reward you with some scholarships as well but it 's usually mostly government loans . That is why I would suggest applying for dozens of scholarships first . Good luck finding the money and good luck once you start school . Remember ; for every hour spent in class you should spend two hours studying !",0

"how do i score a 750+ + score for the GMAT ? Which courses , books etc should I use ? The GMAT is essentially a glorified SAT - all the stuff in there you definitely learned pre-college . I 've never been a big proponent of the GMAT classes because I feel you can get everything out of the book . The class is n't going to teach you some random formula you do n't already know . Both the books and classes essentially spell out what format of questions will be asked in each section . Then they drill you on that format repeatedly until solving for that type of equation or that grammatical structure is second nature no matter what weird way they ask it on the test . I would recommend getting one of the books , Kaplan is pretty much the industry standard . Read it all the way through . Then take every practice test in the book , then save a few bucks and go hang out in the bookstore and take a half a dozen practice tests in other GMAT prep books . Review every question on your test you got wrong and go back into the book to see what “ format ” of question it is and review that again . Then use the free CDROM that should come with your prep book to focus in on any sections you are bombing on the practice tests . This worked for me and one of my buddies . We studied for about two weeks for an average of 3 hours a day and topped out over 750 . The MCAT would be another story…thank god I don ’ t want to be a doctor…",0

"What are the pros and cons of Nuclear thermal propulsion ? Is it feasible to use it in a manned mission to moon ? How is it better than nuclear electric propulsion ? What will be its harmful effects ? Will it violate the NTBT ? Project Orion was an idea in the 1960s to use nuclear explosions to push a space ship around the solar system . The idea was to use a lot of small explosions in succession to create the sort of effect one gets with a continious burn from the usual chemical fueled rockets.There were some small scale tests done with non-nuclear nukes , which suggested the concept was n't crazy , but there was never any full scale tests , and certainly nothing using fission bombs.It is not clear that scaling this concept up to the size needed for a manned rocket would be that feasible , although some disagree with that assesment . There would be a tremendous stress on the vehicle from all these explosions , especially if they were more contained ( in order to harness more of the explosive power for thrust ) .But , I do n't think we 'll ever see anything like this unless there is some sort of mass evacuation of the planet . ( Not there is anywhere to go . ) As you might expect , a Project Orion rocket is essentially the same as a huge number of atmospheric atomic explosions . Not exactly enviro-friendly , to say the least.IF by `` nuclear thermal '' propulsion you mean the generators used by some space probes to generate electricity , then these are far to weak for a manned vehicle . They could n't supply the power to lift off from Earth , and a trip to the moon using an electric ion drive takes much , much longer than the more direct chemically driven Apollo trajectory . Ion propulsion has tried on the space probe Deep Space 1 , although this was not nuclear powered .",0

"How does a Sonicare toothbrush charge with no metal connection points ? How do electrons pass through the plastic in the handle to charge the batteries inside ? I 'm sure it has to do with magnets or something , but I would like spacifics . You are on the right track . It relies on inductive charging : < quote > If you own an electric toothbrush , there 's a good chance that it has a completely sealed toothbrush unit . The toothbrush rests on the charger without any metal contacts to connect the toothbrush to the base . This has the great advantage of allowing the toothbrush to be completely sealed so that water can not enter through exposed contacts . It also avoids any problems with water getting into the contacts and shorting out the charger.This sort of sealed arrangement is called inductive charging . Essentially , the toothbrush and the base form a two-part transformer , with the base having one part of the transformer and the toothbrush having the other . When you slide the toothbrush onto the base , the complete transformer is created and charge can flow.The base contains one of the coils and the metal bar . The toothbrush contains the second coil . When you drop the toothbrush onto the base , you create the complete transformer ! < /quote >",0

"Is cheerleading a sport ? And if you do n't belive so , why not ? It really does get unfair sometimes that people do n't believe cheerleading is a sport . Cheerleaders have this bad reputation , but really , we 're nothing like that . If only people just knew how hard we work , and how much pressure we have on us , then they would believe it 's a sport . We work our asses off ! It 's a sport ! Get used to it ! ! Please find Heather Jeffries , M.P.A opinion here : Most cheerleaders say “ YES ” while state and school officials say “ no. ” According to the National Federation of High School Athletic Associations , seventeen to twenty states of the United States consider cheerleading a sport . Why is the question , “ Is cheerleading a sport ? ” such a controversial issue to anyone not involved with the sport ? According to MSN Encarta , the definition of sport is an individual or group competitive activity involving physical exertion or skill , governed by rules , and sometimes engaged in professionally . Because cheerleading follows every aspect defined under the word sport , it is my belief that cheerleading should be defined as an actual sport.The word cheerleader no longer means a sideline of squads that exist solely to support other sporting teams . Cheer teams are teams in their own right . College and high school cheer teams competefor national titles just as football , basketball , baseball , etc . Cheerleaders are recruited for college scholarships that have been known to exceed amounts awarded to other sports teams . Some cheer teams put in more hours in the gym than teams such as football and basketball . Cheerleaders have to be in just as good physical condition as any other sport participant.Cheerleading in the early years was nothing like the sport it is today . Over the past few decade cheerleading has evolved from leading audiences with simple arm movements to treacherous towers of humans and elaborate dances that are used to show the athleticism of cheerleaders . Cheerleading has developed from selections based on popularity to one that now claims some of the more talented athletes in the school/program.Cheerleaders are not seen as athletes , but seen as being athletic . Cheerleaders are very specialized athletes . Most do not understand the skill and athleticism required by cheerleading . The gymnastics ability , power and strength make cheerleaders some of the more wellrounded athletes in sports . Cheerleading not only teaches coordination and helps condition competitors , but it also teaches teamwork , leadership , communication skills , organizational skills , productivity and much more.Cheerleading contributes to the overall physical fitness of those involved . Many teams are in the gym four to six days a week working out , practicing , stretching and conditioning for upcoming performances or competitions . Running increases one ’ s lung power and endurance . Stretching , jumping , taking gymnastics and aerobics all help keep the body toned and healthy . So as you can see , cheerleading practice and workouts are much like those of other sports.When it comes to funding issues , the sport of cheerleading is not equally supported . Monies are contributed to sports that do not consistently perform well . Cheer teams that do perform well usually do not receive the monetary compensations for their performances . Scholarships , donations from alumni , and extra funding to the school rarely get distributed to the cheer programs . Programs known for winning national titles over several years occasionally receive monies . I believe this occurs only once the administration realizes the need to keep those athletes in their program . Cheerleading does not bring the revenue to schools like football games ; however , the publicity that some cheer teams contribute to the school can be profitable in other ways.As a former cheerleader myself , I remember having long and strenuous practices which seemed to last forever . Because my life was so into cheerleading , I did and still consider cheerleading a sport . I have always told people who I ’ ve talked to about cheerleading that I consider it to be a sport . After being exposed to the competitiveness of cheerleading , I stand stronger behind my beliefs in the sport of cheerleading.Being a co-owner and one of the head coaches for Clarksville Cheer Extreme , an all star cheerleading gym in Clarksville , Tenn",0

"Do you feel that ignorance about science reflects badly on religious people ? As a scientist , I have been quite taken aback by what seem like illogical uninformed statements , sometimes very strongly worded , by those in the religious community ( particularly Christian fundamentalists ) . Statements like:1. evolution depends on carbon dating2 . the big bang is part of evolution3 . if you accept the big bang you are an atheist/offensive to God/damned/etc4 . if you accept evolution you are an atheist/doing the work of the devil/damned/etc5 . illogical , intellectually dishonest definitions of the word `` theory '' in the context of `` scientific theory '' 6. irrational , intellectually dishonest definitions of what is `` scientific '' or what `` religion '' is.Frankly , making statements like this , and wandering into the scientific realm speaking nonsense really reflects badly on the religious community . It would be as if prominent scientists went and started to dictate to religious groups about what they could and could not do , or how they could worship . I feel that ignorance of any sort reflects badly on anyone . I think the problem many religious people have is that they feel science and religion are mutually exclusive , and that the sole purpose of science is to debunk religion . I 'm of another school of thought , that science and faith can coexist quite nicely . I 'm in good company , too : Johann Kepler , one of the greatest astronomers who ever lived : `` “ I thank Thee , my Creator and Lord , that Thou hast given me this joy in Thy creation , this delight in the works of Thy hands ; I have shown the excellency of Thy works unto man , so far as my mind was able to comprehend Thine infinity ” '' Blaise Pascal , mathematician and philosopher , discoverer of what is now called Pascal 's Law : `` ..the only perfect knowledge [ comes ] through Christian revelation '' Sir Isaac Newton : `` This most beautiful system of the sun , planets , and comets , could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being '' Louis Pasteur : `` ..spontaneous generation ( like materialism in general ) threaten [ s ] the very concept of God the Creator '' Wernher von Braun , one of the world ’ s foremost rocket engineers : `` It is as difficult for me to understand a scientist who does not acknowledge the presence of a superior rationality behind the existence of the universe as it is to comprehend a theologian who would deny the advance of science . Far from being independent or opposing forces , science and religion are sisters ... .There is certainly no scientific reason why God can not retain the same position in our modern world that He held before we began probing His creation with the telescope and cyclotron ” 'nuff said . : - )",0

"can i have a child if i have crohns and what are the risk ? can i have achid if I have crohns and what are the risk ? Most women with Crohn 's disease are able to deliver healthy , full-term babies ; however , many people have questions about the impact Crohn 's disease will have on a pregnancy . Women who have Crohn 's disease may be concerned about whether or not they have the physical capacity to carry a pregnancy to term , while men with Crohn 's disease may worry whether medication has affected the viability of their sperm.Will we be able to conceive a baby ? Women with an active case of Crohn 's disease may have difficulty conceiving . Men who use sulfasalazine , a commonly used drug to treat Crohn 's disease , may become temporarily infertile because the sulfa compound can decrease sperm production . If a man is trying to father a child , he should ask his physician about 5-ASA medications which can treat Crohn 's disease without risking fertility . Women with Crohn ’ s disease who are planning to become pregnant should consult a doctor.How can Crohn 's disease affect my pregnancy ? While most women with Crohn 's disease are able to carry a full-term pregnancy and deliver a healthy baby , it is important for you to know that your disease may affect your pregnancy in the following ways : A cesarean section may be required for some women who have Crohn 's disease with complications , including abscesses or fistulas of the rectum or vagina.If a woman is experiencing an active bout of Crohn 's disease during pregnancy she has a 2 to 3 times increased risk of miscarriage , delivering the baby prematurely , or stillbirth.If a woman has active Crohn 's disease at the time of conception , the disease usually runs its course in a similar way to the pattern that was experienced before pregnancy.If a woman is experiencing active Crohn 's disease prior to a pregnancy , she may notice that the symptoms of her disease worsen right after becoming pregnant and during the first 3 months of the pregnancy . The disease may also intensify right after the delivery of her baby . It 's important to remember that every pregnancy is different . There is no evidence showing that if you experience severe symptoms during your pregnancy , subsequent pregnancies will also be difficult.Should I change my diet now that I am pregnant ? It is important for all pregnant women to eat a healthy and well-balanced diet . As a woman with Crohn 's disease , in addition to eating a standard diet recommended during pregnancy , your obstetrician and gastroenterologist may also recommend some special foods , vitamins , and minerals . If your Crohn 's disease is being treated with sulfasalazine , it is important that your diet be supplemented with folic acid , since this is an essential nutrient in preventing certain birth defects.Are medications for Crohn 's disease safe to take during my pregnancy ? All women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant should avoid taking any unnecessary medications . However , if you are experiencing active Crohn 's disease , it may be necessary for you to be treated with medication.If you ’ re a pregnant woman and considering drug therapy , you should speak with both your gastroenterologist and your obstetrician , so that each healthcare provider is well informed about current health issues when recommending treatment options.Are any diagnostic tests safe during pregnancy ? All pregnant women should avoid having X-rays , especially during the first 12 weeks , unless it is absolutely necessary . Presently , MRIs are sometimes used , but more information is needed . The following tests may also be used for pregnant women who may have Crohn 's disease for the management of their disease : Abdominal ultrasoundSigmoidoscopyRectal biopsyUpper endoscopyColonoscopyWill previous surgery for Crohn 's disease affect my pregnancy ?

"box and whisker plots ? how do you pick out the numbers to use with a box and whisker plot when you have all the quartiles , and smallest and largest numbers ? A box-and-whisker plot can be useful for handling many data values . They allow people to explore data and to draw informal conclusions when two or more variables are present . It shows only certain statistics rather than all the data . Five-number summary is another name for the visual representations of the box-and-whisker plot . The five-number summary consists of the median , the quartiles , and the smallest and greatest values in the distribution . Immediate visuals of a box-and-whisker plot are the center , the spread , and the overall range of distribution . The first step in constructing a box-and-whisker plot is to first find the median , thelower quartile and the upper quartile of a given set of data . Example : The following set of numbers are the amount of marbles fifteen different boys own ( they are arranged from least to greatest ) .18 27 34 52 54 59 61 68 78 82 85 87 91 93 100 First find the median . The median is the value exactly in the middle of an ordered set of numbers . *68 is the medianNext , we consider only the values to the left of the median : 18 27 34 52 54 59 61 . We now find the median of this set of numbers . Remember , the median is the value exactly in the middle oa an ordered set of numbers . Thus 52 is the median of the scores less than the median of all scores , and therefore is the lower quartile.52 is the lower quartileNow consider only the values to the right of the median : 78 82 85 87 91 93 100 . We now find the median of this set of numbers . The median 87 is therefore called the upper quartile . 87 is the upper quartile ( *If you 're finding the median in an ordered set with an even number of values , you must take the average of the two middle numbers . For example : 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 . Add the two middle numbers . 5 + 7 = 12 . Divided 12 by 2 to get the average . 12 / 2 = 6 . Therefore 6 is the median for the ordered set of 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 . ) You are now ready to find the interquartile range ( IQR ) . The interquartile range is the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile . In our case the IQR = 87 - 52 = 35 . The IQR is a very useful measurement . It is useful because it is less influenced by extreme values , it limits the range to the middle 50 % of the values.35 is the interquartile rangeplease review these pages .",0

"why gals have boobs ? Well… “ gals , ” ( as you call them ) have breast mainly for two reasons:1 ) They are necessary to provide nourishment to their offspring ( children ) just as all other female animals in nature do . Before the invention and convenience of bottles and breast formula , breast milk was the only possible food for newborns to consume . The child 's body structure was not yet developed enough for the breakdown and distribution of vitamins , minerals , etc from solid food yet , so breast milk provided them with the needed nutrients from what the mother was eating to develop properly.2 ) The other reason coincides with the first . Females have breast as an aesthetically attractive feature to attract males . In the natural process of things , females are the force behind our survival , ( as a human race ) , and just like all other animals , they have inborn “ assets ” ( trying to be tactful here ) that assist them in acquiring a mating partner .",0

"Does anyone know the easiest and quickest way to tell if any number is prime ? Going through possible factors is n't practical , and can take forever , so that 's not a viable choice . Also , any prime number has to end in 1 , 3 , 7 , or 9 , because otherwise it 's not prime . ( Even numbers are divisible by 2 and 5 just means it 's divisible by 5 ) I just had a math packet dealing with this topic . There are many equations out there that deal with finding primes , but all so far fail at a certain point in the sequence . The method you refer to , called the Sieve of Eratosthenes , was developed by its namesake in Greece sometime between the 500s and 350 B.C . and is so far the only proven method to find primes . Sorry , but unfortunately , there is no other accurate choice .",0
"Why do electrical outlets have 2 different sized sockets ? Wall sockets have AC voltages , so there is no positive and negative . One of the two prongs has what is called `` Hot '' , and the other is called `` Neutral '' . The Neutral is connected to ground back at a distribution center , while the Hot is 110 Volts AC ( in the U.S. ) . By the time it gets to your home , the Neutral is not quite ground anymore , but is still relatively safe- wheras the Hot is quite dangerous and potentially deadly.Some appliances are designed to have extra protection between the Hot and people . For example , a light socket has the 'threads ' ( the easily touched part ) connected to Neutral . As another example , most appliances and the light switches disconnect the Hot when they are off.The different sizes of the sockets prevent you from plugging an applicance in backwords . If you did this , then the switch would disconnect the Neutral instead , and leave the Hot on- making the device less safe .",0

"i want to know everything about GENETICS. ? Genetics , scientific study of how physical , biochemical , and behavioural traits are transmitted from parents to their offspring . The word itself was coined in 1906 by the British biologist William Bateson . Geneticists determine the mechanisms of inheritance whereby the offspring of sexually reproducing organisms do not exactly resemble their parents , and the differences and similarities between parents and offspring recur from generation to generation in repeated patterns . The investigation of these patterns has led to some of the most exciting discoveries in modern biology.Soon after Mendel 's work was rediscovered , scientists realized that the patterns of inheritance he had described paralleled the action of chromosomes in dividing cells , and they proposed that the Mendelian units of inheritance , the genes , are carried by the chromosomes . This led to intensive studies of cell division.Every cell comes from the division of a pre-existing cell . All the cells that make up a human being , for example , are derived from the successive divisions of a single cell , the zygote ( see Fertilization ) , which is formed by the union of an egg and a sperm . The great majority of the cells produced by the division of the zygote are , in the composition of their hereditary material , identical to one another and to the zygote itself ( assuming that no mutations occur ; see below ) . Each cell of a higher organism is composed of a jellylike layer of material , the cytoplasm , which contains many small structures . This cytoplasmic material surrounds a prominent body called the nucleus . Every nucleus contains a number of minute , threadlike chromosomes . Some relatively simple organisms , such as cyanobacteria and bacteria , have no distinct nucleus but do have cytoplasm , which contains one or more chromosomes.Chromosomes vary in size and shape and usually occur in pairs . The members of each pair , called homologues , closely resemble each other . Most cells in the human body contain 23 pairs of chromosomes , whereas most cells of the fruit fly Drosophila contain four pairs , and the bacterium Escherichia coli has a single chromosome in the form of a ring . Every chromosome in a cell is now known to contain many genes , and each gene is located at a particular site , or locus , on the chromosome.The process of cell division by which a new cell comes to have an identical number of chromosomes as the parent cell is called mitosis ( see Reproduction ) . In mitotic division each chromosome divides into two equal parts , and the two parts travel to opposite ends of the cell . After the cell divides , each of the two resulting cells has the same number of chromosomes and genes as the original cell ( see Cell : Division , Reproduction , and Differentiation ) . Every cell formed in this process thus has the same genetic material . Simple one-celled organisms and some multicellular forms reproduce by mitosis ; it is also the process by which complex organisms achieve growth and replace worn-out tissue.Higher organisms that reproduce sexually are formed from the union of two special sex cells known as gametes . Gametes are produced by meiosis , the process by which germ cells divide . It differs from mitosis in one important way : in meiosis a single chromosome from each pair of chromosomes is transmitted from the original cell to each of the new cells . Thus , each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes that are found in the other body cells . When two gametes unite in fertilization , the resulting cell , called the zygote , contains the full , double set of chromosomes . Half of these chromosomes normally come from one parent and half from the other.For more than 50 years after the science of genetics was established and the patterns of inheritance through genes were clarified , the largest questions remained unanswered : how are the chromosomes and their genes copied from cell to cell , and how do they direct the structure and behaviour of living things ?

"Why do so many Christians seem to think that they have a monopoly on happiness ? Oh , wrathpuppet , you poor sad atheist . You have no hope . You and you kind are so sad.I read this a lot . Can you not accept that myself and many non-believers are actually warm , loving , hopeful , happy people ? It seems profoundly arrogant to assume that because someone does n't share your beliefs that they must be miserable . I 'm stating as a fact that this is not the case.So , why assume that we are all sad and hopeless ? We have hope for a better world , believing that this is our one chance , and as such , our responsibility to future generations.You assumptions are much the same as a billionaire believing that a migrant farm worker can not be happy because he has no money . Or a farm worker believing that a wealthy man can not be happy because he is tethered to his work.It is very presumptuous to assume that just because someone has something ( or lacks something ) that they can not be happy.Anyone care to comment on this ? Whew -- Here 's a question to all those who post about religious folks and non-religious folks ... Are we ever going to settle this ?

Ya know like they 'd heard bad reviews , or just did n't think the material was something they were interested in . But it 's killing you because you love and respect these people and you wish them to share in this wonderful cinematic experience ... and you 're sure if they would just take the time and go , they 'd thank you for it later ? ** to carry this theme out ... it 's not that you believe these folks ( that you 're trying to tell about this great movie ) have never seen a good picture before or that they could n't discover it on their own , it 's just that it was SO good for you , SO moving , SO vital , that you really believed if they never saw it , their life would not be as rich as if they had.Shortest answer possible , they think they 're doing you a favor or a kindness , you may already have an interesting life that has happiness in it , but they fear for your eternal happiness . I for one will leave each to their own , and only try an help the ones who say they are unhappy or in some need , and the answer from me rarely will have religious overtones . My God is just love .

"Does anyone know anything about skydiving ? How about in Kansas ? There are actually five skydiving centers in Kansas ( see the United States Parachute Association web page http : //www.uspa.org/dz/states/KS.htm.I happen to be slightly bias , as I ’ m the Drop Zone Owner of one of the five ; Air Capital Drop Zone http : //www.aircapitaldropzone.com located 10 miles SE of Wichita Kansas.Basically there are two types of first jump ; Tandem , you ’ ll be attached with a Tandem Skydiving Instructor ( two people , one system ) . You ’ ll freefall from generally above 10,000 ’ down to between 5,000 ’ , and 6,000 ’ or approximately 30 seconds ( one mile at 120 mph ) . Round canopies are a thing of the past ; you ’ ll descend under a high performance rectangular wing ( ram air canopy ) to a soft landing . Cost generally ranges from the $ 170 range in Kansas , to $ 230 or so on the east or west coast.Solo , of which there are two forms being the old standard Static Line training method , and Accelerated Freefall ( AFF ) . For Static line you ’ ll have a 4 to 6 hour ground school , then you ’ ll jump from 4,000 ’ and your main parachute will start deployment as you fall away from the airplane . The “ accelerated ” in refers to the fact that you ’ ll freefall with a solo rig ( as opposed to tandem ) on your first jump . The ground training generally runs a couple of hours longer than the Static Line training , but you ’ ll exit from again above 10 ’ 000 ’ with two AFF instructors physically holding onto you for the freefall portion of your skydive . With both methods , once you ’ re under an open canopy , you ’ ll have assistance from the ground.There are methods which incorporate , and mix the methods . With “ Tandem Progressing ” you ’ ll be required to do a minimum of 3 tandem skydives , and then you ’ ll move into the AFF progression . The United States Parachute Association is the non government member association for skydiving in the US . You ’ re required to complete 25 freefalls to qualify for your first USPA license.Modern skydiving is very safe compared to its roots in the early days . Every skydiver is required to jump with two canopies ; a main and reserve . The main canopy malfunction rate is 1 in 1,000 +/- , and is generally related to the fact that they are cutting edge , high performance . The malfunction rate for reserves is in the range of wining the lottery . In the United States there are generally 20 to 30 skydiving fatalities ( of one million plus jumps ) , well in excess of 99 % of these fatalities are attributed to pilot error.MartinAC DZ",0

The setting up & running part of the business aside , I think the very first thing you hsould do is look into what sort of permits you will need from the city . Some cities only allow this sort of business in certain areas ( zoning ) while others have some VERY specific ordinances & permit issues that have to be adhered to . Once you determine the feasibility of how long it will take to get yourself set up properly with the city - as well as if you will need to open in an area other than the one you might have wished to - then it is just a matter of getting the business side of things in order , locating & securing a building , furnishing it & hiring dancers.Good luck !",0

"Are there any plutonium compounds ? Plutonium reacts readily with oxygen , forming PuO and PuO2 , as well as intermediate oxides . It reacts with the halides , giving rise to compounds such as PuX3 where X can be F , Cl , Br or I ; PuF4 is also seen . The following oxyhalides are observed : PuOCl , PuOBr and PuOI . It will react with carbon to form PuC , nitrogen to form PuN and silicon to form PuSi2.Plutonium like other actinides readily forms a dioxide plutonyl core ( PuO2 ) . In the environment , this plutonyl core readily complexes with carbonate as well as other oxygen moeities ( OH- , NO2- , NO3- , and SO4-2 ) to form charged complexes which can be readily mobile with low affinities to soil . * PuO2 ( CO3 ) 1-2 * PuO2 ( CO3 ) 2-4 * PuO2 ( CO3 ) 3-6PuO2 formed from neutralizing highly acidic nitric acid solutions tends to form polymeric PuO2 which is resistant to complexation . Plutonium also readily shifts valences between the +3 , +4 , +5 and +6 states . It is common for some fraction of plutonium in solution to exist in all of these states in equilibrium .",0

Steelers won , get over it . ca n't blame refs . neither team really played that well . Seattle might have gotten a couple of bad calls on critical plays that might have swung momentum in their favor , but when the ball was in their hands , they pretty much dropped it every time ( hint , hint ) . The bad play calling and clock mismanagement towards the end of the first half and the end of the game pretty much said it all for the Seahawks that day .

"Will unfounded domestic violence charge hold up in court in Va ? My husband and I were arguing in our apartment and the neighbors called the police . We were alreay in the process of `` making up '' . The police came and interviewed him and visualy saw marks on me from the `` making up '' . The police arrested him for domestic violence and said that the state of Virginia would charge him for it not the city . They never took a statement from me nor pictures . From the time my husband got arrested to his release back to me took 45 min . He litterly walked in the back door did some paperwork and walked out the front.What are the odds that he will be found guilty with only the testamony of the officer and me testifying and telling my story in defense of my husband in the state of Va. You know , I suspect you 're not going to get many takers on this one . You 've got a lot of issues here that are very involved and nobody who knows what they are talking about is going to be able to give you an answer based on the `` facts '' you 've presented here.Rather than try to answer your question , let me ask you some more : What do you define as arguing ? Was it strictly verbal or was there any physical touching whatsoever ? Were any threats of any kind made during the argument ? You said the police saw marks on you from `` making up '' ... which , frankly , is very suspicious to an old cop like me . But the question is , what kind of marks ? Are you talking about a hickey or a bruise ? When the police interviewed your husband , what did he say ? Did he perhaps admit to doing something that would have violated the law in your state ? And please - if you did not personally hear the interview between your husband and the police , you do not *know* what was said ... you might know what your husband told you later , but if you did n't hear it for yourself , you do n't know.Do n't know if you 're asking a question about the city or the state prosecuting , but if you are : not unusual for the state to prosecute a domestic violence charge , even if the victim denies it or changes their story later.If you told the police the marks on you were from `` making up '' , then they did take a statement from you . Once you said that , the police may have felt that was all the statement they were going to get out of you - especially if the marks they saw were not consistent with what you said was `` making up '' ( for example : most people do n't make up by leaving bruises , swollen lips , scratches , black eyes , etc ... if those are the marks you 're talking about , I 'm with the cops on this one ) .If you had marks , the police certainly should have taken photos of them . Some types of minor injuries do n't show well in photos ( especially depending on the equipment ) so they may not have thought photos were worthwhile or they just simply did n't take them . What were your `` marks '' ? You 're asking what the odds are that he 'll be found guilty based on what you say is the officer 's testimony and your statement in defense of your husband . Ca n't answer that one because neither you nor I have all the facts , I suspect.What did the neighbors say ( or more importantly , do the neighbors have something to say ; did they hear threats , did they hear physical violence , did they hear you say something that would suggest you were being victimized ) ? What did he say ? Maybe without meaning to , he admitted to a crime . He would n't be the first person to do so ... and if the cops were skillful interviewers , they may have obtained an admission or confession from him without him realizing he was doing so.What is the crime of domestic violence in Virginia ? You were smart to include that you 're in that state because it certainly makes a difference ( and unfortunately , I 'm not from there ) .Do the police know you and your husband ? Either of you been arrested for domestic violence before ? Bottom line : way too many `` what-if 's '' for anyone to give you an educated answer to your question . Depending on the answers to the questions I 've asked , the chances of him being found guilty could be very good , or very poor.And finally : I 've investigated domestic violence crimes for over 18 years as a police officer . I hope everything you wrote here is absolutely true ... that you were not the victim of domestic violence , and that you are as safe today as the day you were born . I hope nobody ever lays a hand on you , threatens you , or abuses you . However , what you 've written here ( and what I suspect your answers to some of my questions might be ) is some of the most commonly-expressed statements I 've heard from domestic violence vi",0

"What is the theory of relativity ? I have gotten mixed information on this subject , and would like to know the truth . Any resources would be great . Wellrelativity Physical theory , introduced by Albert Einstein , that discards the concept of absolute motion and instead treats only relative motion between two systems or frames of reference . One consequence of the theory is that space and time are no longer viewed as separate , independent entities but rather are seen to form a four-dimensional continuum called space-time . Full comprehension of the mathematical formulation of the theory can be attained only through a study of certain branches of mathematics , e.g. , tensor calculus . Both the special and general theories have been established and accepted into the structure of physics . Einstein also sought unsuccessfully for many years to incorporate the theory into a unified field theory valid also for subatomic and electromagnetic phenomena.Evolution from Classical TheoryThe modern theory is an extension of the simpler Galilean or Newtonian concept of relativity , which holds that the laws of mechanics are the same in one system as in another system in uniform motion relative to it . Thus , it is impossible to detect the motion of a system by measurements made within the system , and such motion can be observed only in relation to other systems in uniform motion . The older concept of relativity assumes that space and time are correctly measured separately and regards them as absolute and independent realities . The system of relativity and mechanics of Galileo and Newton is perfectly self-consistent , but the addition of Maxwell 's theory of electricity and magnetism to the system leads to fundamental theoretical difficulties related to the problem of absolute motion .",0

"why female breasts are so large compared to other mammals ? if you consider that such a large and chubby organ would be disadvantegous for surviving , how do you explain the evolution of sumptuous female breasts ? i think most of you think that this is associated with breastfeeding . but many mammals breastfeed too , but they dont have such large organs , right ? what is the deal with those nice breasts ? can you figure out what is going on ? There is definitely some severe debate going on concerning this issue . Some have proposed women have prominent breasts as the result of natural or sexual selection . Suggesting since women with large breasts are considered more desirable they would have more suitors and as a result reproduce more often . Others argue that this concept myopic because its based solely on modern Western society 's ideals of what is considered attractive . Those folks would suggest that breast size has seldom been of major importance in most societies . In the majority of societies breasts are just a source of nourishment for infants and young children . Whereas there is a relatively important argument against the latter argument in favor of the former . It would be difficult to believe that there is some `` natural selection '' root for the `` modern western society '' propensity of finding women with large breasts attractive . It would seem unlikely that these sorts of pervasive ideals toward the female form would simply appear out of thin air -- that 's giving Playboy a lot of credit I think.Then minimalistic view of why female breasts become so prominant is that the development of the female breast during puberty is likely the side affect of some biological necessity that is not readily apparent . Perhaps it is simply that human females experience a greater increase in estrogen levels during puberty than do other mammals.I do have to admit that I like the theory mentioned above about the need for larger to prevent suffococation while breast feeding , however , I would reckon that a major contribution to increased breast size may be the increased fatty content of our diet . This may be an explanation for why past cultures did n't have an affinity toward large breasts , because of the lack of high fat content in their diet , there were few women who displayed large breasts . However , because diet was usually a representation of status , there were many female members of aristocracic classes throughout time who were viewed as the most beautiful women of their day . These women tended to be rather Rubenesque . So , maybe it was already engrained in the human race early on.So , it 's not well known the mechanism by which female breasts have become more promenent in comparison to other mamals . Which leads me onece again to my soap box : When it comes to biology/evolution , it 's impossible to answer much of anything when it comes to `` why . '' Things happen for reasons , but very little of -- if any -- biology happens for a reason . Breasts are n't more prominent in the human species when compared to other mammalian species because of any designed reason . It could be that women with bigger breasts are more likely to mate , or mate more often , than women with smaller breasts , maybe it is our diet , whatever the reason that allows for breast sizes to increase , the genetics that allow for this to happen was determined by hundreds of the thousands -- if not millions -- of years of selective pressures that selected these genes as the most fit . These pressures have altered and molded these genes to their current status .",0

"Where can I learn all about the basics of credit cards ? i know almost nothing about them except that you use them to pay for things . i want to know first the basics , and then strategies to avoid having bad credit ( i dont have any credit yet ) . I 've been searching all over , but the websites i find are always using terms and acronyms that i 'm not sure i know the meaning of . can someone help me out ? I agree with VaTreasures - the best thing you can do when using a credit card is to discipline yourself to pay off your balance on time . If you get into a habit of not paying on time you start to acrue more and more interest fees ( I know all about it ) . Paying back on time will also avoid any missed payment penalties.Apply for a credit card with an interest free period , this will cut down on costs . Getting an interest free period is important.If you are unhappy with the idea of running a credit account , then I would recommend a prepaid card or direct debit card . Prepaid cards can be loaded with funds so you can not overspend , which keeps your finances in good shape . Debit cards withdraw funds from your bank account instantly when you make a purchase , again these do not require managing a credit account and help discipline your spending.More helpful tips from round the web :",0

"why are women so mentally differant from men ? why is it that when a man knows that somthing is bothering a woman and he ask her `` whats wrong '' they always say `` nothing '' ... but if the roles are reversed he tells her whats bothering him . The right and left hemispheres of the human brain are connected by a huge nerve bundle called the corpus callosum . In the male fetus when male hormones are generated the corpus callosum shrinks reducing cross-communication . Because the left hemisphere deals with logic and the right hemisphere deals with emotion , women connect all logic better with emotion than men do . Although a man can chose , he is always either logical or emotional but rarely both at the same time . A man either flies off the handle or thinks the problem through . A woman can weep or laugh when she discovers something that makes sense . This explains why women are better at nurturing ( cranky ) children and men are better at hunting for bears ( or a six pack ) . You figure out the rest . I ca n't .",0

"Why does like charges repel each other ? This is a very good question . Ultimately it comes down to being one of the fundamental features of our universe . But it can also be broken down a bit.Like charges repel , and opposite ones attract because of differences in their electric fields . But the electric fields are really part of the larger electromagnetic force . This force is mediated by photons ( light ) and , indeed light is a self-propagating electromagnetic wave.But there are also three other fundamental forces : gravity , the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force . The strong nuclear force is well , strong , but very short range . It holds the protons and neutrons together in a nucleus ( otherwise the like charges from the protons would break up every nucleus except hydrogen ) . The weak nuclear force is sort of a miscellaneous , and comes into play in certain radioactive decay sequences.In the 1980s it was shown that the electromagnetic and weak forces are actually the same thing . The difference we observe is that the universe is , relatively speaking , `` cold , '' and these two parts have separated out . It is sort of like having a glass of steam ( one thing ) which cools down until there is water and ice ( two things ) . The water and ice look a lot different from each other , but are fundamentally the same . In the same way in the very , very early universe when things were a lot hotter , the electromagnetic and weak forces were identical - like the steam in the analogy.More recently it was found that the strong force can also be linked to the `` electroweak '' force in the same sort of manner . The mathematical and physical details are different from `` electroweak unification '' but the basic principle is the same . It was from this Grand Unification of the electromagnetic , weak , and strong forces the the theoretical notion of quarks came . This GUT has been tested and the experiments show it is right on target.The next step is to connect the electro-weak-strong force with gravity . This is a lot harder because the first three are understood in the context of Quantum Mechanics and gravity is understood with General Relativity . QM and GR are not compatible on some basic principles.One approach that is being tried to combine QM and GR is with string theory . To make this work the universe is composed of 11 dimensions , the usual 3-spatial and 1-temporal dimentsion , plus 7 very , very small spatial dimensions . If these extra 7 are looped around themselves so that they are vastly `` smaller '' than a proton , we 'd never really notice them.What string theory seems to suggest is that there are just some ways to make stuff in the universe , and one of these ways is to create the `` force particles '' that mediate the fundamental forces.So , extrapolating that , and realizing that string theory is in no sense proven , we can say that `` like charges repel '' because of the geometry ( the 11-dimensions ) of the universe.But string theory remains far from being complete mathematically , and no one can really make solid predictions yet to test it . So , you can also fall back on the answer in the first paragraph .",0

"Where did the term `` I 'll be there with bells on '' originate ? I seem to remember reading somewhere that in the old sled/carriage days that if a fellow teamster had to bail you out of trouble , you traditionally gave them your sleighbells as a thank you ( or mark of shame ? ) . Ca n't find that reference any more . Direct quote from http : //www.rootsweb.com/~genepool/meanings.htm : `` To be somewhere with `` bells on '' refers to a practice peddlers had when they roamed the area west of the Appalachians selling wares . To avoid Indians , they traveled as silently as possible until they reached a settled area . Then they unmuffled bells hung around their horses necks to announce their arrival to outlying cabins . Hence , `` I 'll be there with bells on . '' The peddlers ' arrival was a much anticipated major event in the mostly tedious and hard lives of settlers , not only for the goods they sold , but also for the news , letters , and messages they carried from the outside world .

"President Kennedy a gread pres. ? Why specifically is President Kennedy remembered as such a great President ? What was his greatest achievement ? He was charismatic , but he was n't a great president.His unplanned remarks to Nikita Khruschev , President of the Soviet Union , caused Khruschev to judge Kennedy to be weak . Consequently , he installed nuclear missles in Cuba . Kennedy reacted by blockading Cuba . For several days in October 1963 , the world was on the brink of a nuclear war.Shortly after taking office , he allowed plans for an invasion of Cuba to proceed . The invasion by Cuban refugees from Miami was a debacle that was a violation of international law and a humiliation to the United States.He continued the program of sending military advisors to Viet Nam . After his death , this was continued by President Lyndon Johnson and expanded into the Viet Nam war . The Viet Nam war destroyed Johnson 's presidency.To his great credit , he was aggressive about furthering the Civil Rights movement by supporting activists with Federal authority in several high profile integration efforts.If he had lived , almost surely he would have been elected to a second term . He seemed to grow wiser while in office . Would that wisdom have led him to become a great president ? Would the US have become bogged down in an unwinnable war in Viet Nam ? Would his philandering have brought him down ? Interesting questions.Wikipedia knows all.I was 10 when he was elected and 13 when he was assassinated . I will never forget the optimism he brought to the country . We believed he could lead us into the bright future . I will never forget the terror of the Cuban Missle Crisis . I will never forget the devastation I felt when he was assassinated . The United States has not been the same since . John Kennedy was the last president who _lead_ us . Presidents after him have been followers without vision.In 1989 ( I was 39 ) , I went to President Kennedy 's grave in Arlington Cemetary . Probably 15 or 20 people were there . I was amazed that people were moved to silence , even those obviously born after his presidency . I felt a great deal of reverence and had tears in my eyes .",0

"Best food for brain ? What can I eat to be more clever and remember more things ? Oh without question ... Try fish ... It makes a big difference ... you will fill it happen ... increased concentration and improved memory.This because fish contains Omega-3 fatty acids which is an 'essential fatty acid ' . An 'essential fatty acid ' is a type of fatty acid needed by our bodies which needs to be supplemented in our diets as we are incapable of producing it ourselves . Since most of us eat hugely insufficient amounts of such fatty acids , most of us are deficient in it . So adding it to our diets usually fulfils the immediate need for them and makes a big difference . Fatty fish are excellent sources of Omega-3 , but there is some concern about increased levels of heavy metal contaminants in their meat ... so i think it is best and more convenient to supplement your diet with processed fish oils ... which have been purified . Cod liver oil capsules are a popular and easily available fish oil supplement , however are very rich in Vitamin A . Perhaps the best choice left is to consider Fish Body Oil instead of fish liver oil ... if you can get your hands on those . Do consider it ... it 'll really help you out ... .. if you decide on taking cod liver oil ... take no more than one capsule every 3 or 4 days ... just to be on the safe side . Fish body oils can be safely taken every other day .",0

"I am preparing a speech on the importance of faith in God , can anyone tell me why they believe ? THE REASON FOR MY QUESTION IS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT GOD EXISTS , THE PROOF IS ALL AROUND US . AND YET THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO REFUSE TO GIVE GOD THE PRAISE HE DESERVES , CAN ANYONE SHARE AS TO WHY THEY BELIEVE AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO GIVE ANY TESTIMONIES YOU MAY HAVE . I AM PRESENTING A SPEECH IN MY PUBLIC SPEAKING CLASS ON HOW IMPORTANT BELIEVING GOD IS AND I WOULD LOVE TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS FROM REAL EVERYDAY PEOPLE THAT LOVE CHRIST JUST AS I DO . THANK YOU . I became a Christian when I was 14 . My grandma was living with us and had Alzheimer 's disease . There was a lot of fighting in my family . I was watching TBN and Jan Crouch invited me to give my life to Christ . She said that God wants to take me from where I am and do something amazing with my life . I just have to trust Him . So right then and there I bowed my head and asked Christ into my heart.Since then , God has done amazing things in my life . Today , I 'm a college graduate and will be pursuing a Master 's degree in Special Education . I was on my college newspaper and won a first place award in the entire state for my Opinion writing . I give all the glory to God for my accomplishments.God even rescued me from a cult . I joined a cult when I was in college , and my spirit began to cry out for God . Late at night , I went to the Christian church where I 'd been baptized originally . The ( huge ) church was completely empty as far as I could tell , but I saw a light under one door . I put my hand on the door handle , opened the door , went in and prayed with the pastor in there . After that I became active in the church again and seeing me later the pastor told me that the door I 'd walked through was acutally locked -- he checked after I left , but I 'd opened it like it was open . I know a miracle happened there and God opened the door for me.On an intellectual level , I 've come to understand that God is more real than we have ever imagined . I 've read books such as `` More than a Carpenter '' by Josh McDowell , `` The Case for Faith '' by Lee Strobel and the information on the website of the Institute for Creation Research at http : //www.icr.org As I 've gotten older I 've come to believe in God on an intellectual level as well as in my heart .",0

"If jesus is Lord / God when he died on the cross who kept the universe in order ? Is the trinity false ? Excellent question . But unfortunately , I have yet to hear a good answer . God the Almighty Creator does n't even blink for a second , nonetheless die . If this were true and God died on the cross , then ALL existance would cease.Here 's what makes the trinity questionable : If you have a creature ( i.e . a created being ) , and a third of that creature dies while the other two-thirds are still alive , then that creature has n't really died . All parts would have to die for the creature to be considered dead . So if this applies to a created being , how can it not apply to the Creator ? If a third of God dies , but the other two-thirds are still alive , then that third did n't really die ; especially when he 's resurrected within a number of hours.The fact is that death in itself is a creation . Therefore the dimension of death can not be applied to an infinite entity which exists outside the realm of all creation . i.e . No creator , or any part of a creator , dies.What does that mean anyways ? What does it mean that a third of God has died ? ? ? This can only indicate that the trinity is not true ; it 's merely a pagan practice that has filtered down to blemish the noble message of Prophet Jesus ( peace be upon him ) . ( see link below ) For those who say angels , well who was sustaining the angels in God 's absence ? Did you really hear yourself say that ? ?",0

Bras do n't preserve the shape or perkiness of breasts .

"If Nero is the person spoke about in Rev 13:18 , is Gaius the person spoke about in Rev 13:5. ? I have been reading up on an interesting theory about the Roman Emperor Nero being the person that the Bible is referring to in Rev 13:18 , so if this is true , who are the earlier beasts ? Rev 13:5 reads : And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies ; and power was given unto him to continue forty [ and ] two months.Gaius is the only emporer before Nero that could possibly fit this description because his reign was from A.D. 37-41 Three years and ten months to be exact ; The bible mentioned 42 months which is three years and six months ... From reading this site I could see where it would make sense for him to fit into the theory , but I 'm still skeptical.http : //www.roman-emperors.org/gaius.htm Just food for thought ... No .

I 'm not asking this because i 'm planning to revolt or think that it would be a good idea , just curious about what people think . lol . I think it is usually acceptable to break the law if , by not breaking it , someone would suffer bodily harm or death . Also , if the law is fundamentally designed to discriminate , I think that at the very least some people need to break it in order to be able to argue against it in the Supreme Court , for example when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat .",0
"why did terry bradshaw not appear with the mvp 's in the super bowl ? When the NFL unveiled its MVPs from the previous 39 Super Bowls , only three living members skipped the ceremony.Former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana and former Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw decided to stay home , while former Dolphins MVP Jake Scott was traveling in Australia.Montana , the league 's only three-time Super Bowl MVP , and Bradshaw reportedly turned down the invitation over money.Both denied the reports.In a phone interview with ESPN2 's Cold Pizza on Monday night , Montana vehemently denied forgoing the ceremony over money and reiterated that his absence was due to his preference to see his son 's basketball game.He 'd told Cold Pizza last week he was n't going to be at the game because his son had an important basketball game he wanted to attend . Bradshaw , according to the Chronicle , told league officials he wanted to be with his family.Montana said money was never an issue and that he would not have attended the Super Bowl ceremony even if the appearance fee had been greater than the $ 100,000 he was reported to have requested.Former MVPs were given $ 1,000 for incidental expenses while in Detroit , along with other amenities such as plane tickets , car rental and game tickets.Sources told each paper that Montana asked for a guarantee of at least $ 100,000 in appearance money.When the league balked at Montana 's demands , the quarterback declined to be in attendance .",0

"i need to know what plants mean for a school project. ? example : laurel wreaths symbolize victory . i need an answer soon ! ASAP ! ! ! Need an answer for your project before monday ? Its not a good idea to leave stuff like that for the last minute.Flowers have been irresitible to painters through the ages . These days we 've lost much of the symbolism associated with them , but earlier painters chose flowers to convey very specific messages about their subjects . The meaning associated with a specific flower differs between cultures ; the symbolism for each given here is from Western European culture unless specified otherwise.Bamboo : A symbol for longevity ( it 's always got green shoots ) as well as strength and grace ( it bends readily but does n't break easily ) . In Chinese philosophy the straight stem of bamboo symbolises the path towards enlightment , the segments of the stem being the steps along the way.Carnation : A symbol of betrothal or engagement . In China , a carnation is a symbol of marriage.Chrysanthemum : The national symbol of Japan , 'mums are a symbol for long life.Clover leaf : The three divided leaves of clover ( also known as shamrock or wood sorrel ) represent the Christian Holy Trinity of God the Father , Christ the Son , and the Holy Spirit.Kabbalah SymbolsGreat deals on Kabbalah Symbols The national symbol of Ireland and of Ireland 's patron saint , St Patrick ( his feast day is 17 March ) .

Also of generosity.Iris : Associated with death as Iris was a Greek goddess of the rainbow , which she used to travel down to earth with messages from the gods and to transport women 's souls to the underworld . The three upright petals and three drooping sepals are symbols for faith , valour , and wisdom.Jasmine : This strongly scented , white flower is used as a Hindu symbol for love.Lily : Symbolises purity , chastity , and innocence .

"who is guru ? The syllable gu means shadowsThe syllable ru , he who disperses them , Because of the power to disperse darknessthe guru is thus named.A guru ( गुरू Sanskrit ) is a teacher in Hinduism , Buddhism or Sikhism . Based on a long line of philosophical understanding as to the importance of knowledge , the guru is seen in these religions as a sacred conduit , or a way to self-realization . In India and among people of Hindu , Buddhist , or Sikh belief , the title retains a hallowed meaning.Guru also refers in Sanskrit to Brihaspati , a Hindu figure analogous to the Roman planet/god Jupiter . In Vedic astrology , Jupiter/Guru/Brihaspati is believed to exert teaching influences . Indeed , in many Indian languages , such as Hindi , the occidental Thursday is called either Brihaspativaar or Guruvaar ( vaar meaning period or day ) .In contemporary India and Indonesia , Guru is widely used within the general meaning of `` teacher '' . In Western usage , the original meaning of guru has been extended to cover anyone who acquires followers , though not necessarily in an established school of philosophy or religion . In a further metaphorical extension , guru is used to refer to a person who has authority because of his or her perceived knowledge or skills in a domain of expertise.The importance of discerning between a true guru and a false one is explored in scriptures and teachings of religions in which a guru plays a role . The assessment and criticism of gurus and the Guru-shishya tradition are espoused in the discourse about cults and new religious movements by Western secular scholars , theologians , anti-cultists and by skeptics both in the West and in India .",0
"A Statistical Evaluation of Multiplicative Congruential Generators ? what the main idea ? This is a cool question . The main idea is to check how random a random number generator really is.A random number generator is a system , usually involving a computer which creates a list of random numbers . All random number generators are really pseudo-random , which just means that unless there is some bizzare input , like static from a radio , the list of numbers is predictable and therefore not really random.For example an example of a simple random number generator is one of a pair of dice . The die will always show a number from 1 to 6 . If you wrote down zillions of rolls of the die , and made a bar chart , a really fair die would show equal length bars for each number . This is an example of an Statistical Evaluation . Other evaluations might be to show what the bar chart curve looks like ( bell curve etc . ) , or the average etc.Fair random number generators are important for gambling machines , state lotteries , scientific testing , and mathematics.The most famous multiplicative linear congruential generator was RANDU invented by IBM in 1968 . By multiplying numbers together one after another using modulo arithmetic ( like the way a clock repeats every 12 hours ) based on a starting number or SEED , it was a simple way to get numbers . Unfortunately , statistical tests showed it was way off . The numbers fell into patterns which were not random .",0
"Should I get a Master 's in Special Education or Public Policy ? I enjoy both fields . I currently have a bachelor 's in Finance , a field I 'm not too interested in.In the past I had a two year internship with my State Senator and a 1 year job as a special ed instructional assistant . I enjoyed both positions.Paying for it is not too much of a problem either as the state offers loan reimbursements for special ed teachers and the school of public policy is offering generous scholarships.So perhaps it comes down to job availability . There is definately a big need for special ed teachers . I do n't know how easy it is to get a legislative job however , although if it is possible I may really enjoy it.What do you think ? While public policy is an undoubedly exciting field , the rewards you 'll get and receive in special education are certainly among the most satisfying available.You have an opportunity to positively affect countless children and adults with challenges far beyond the average person . In the end , you have to follow your heart . I suggest searching it carefully to see what it holds for this field . The best of luck to you !",0

"Has anyone heard of the `` sleep cure '' ? Supposedly it 's a means to lose a fair amount of weight over the course of a few days . You 're sedated and you wake up days later having lost 8-10 pounds . Real , or just some fictional fantasy that keeps cropping up in various books ? Sounds like some serious wishful thinking to me , combined with some misinterpreted observation.If you weigh yourself right before bed and then first thing in the morning , you will find that you 've lost a couple of pounds overnight . However , you 'll find by that evening that the weight is back.Makes it look like the best way to lose weight is to sleep , eh ? But it 's just water weight . You go to bed hydrated , you wake up dehydrated . Bummer.Sleeping for a few days may net you more weight loss , but some of that will be a loss in muscle ton , which will result in making it even harder to lose more weight and a good probability of gaining more weight than you lost.The best way to lose weight is to stop trying to lose weight . Instead , concentrate on improving your health . Yeah , yeah , exercise and eat right . * There 's a lot of details missing in those four words , but the gist is that any attempt to lose weight that does n't involve those activities are just ways of screwing your health for looks . The reason that I say stop trying to lose weight ? Weight is too complex a system to control reliably and any method that involves looking at a scale regularly will have a very good chance of just frustrating you to the point of giving up .",0

"who discovered the atom ? Democritus and Leucippus , Greek philosophers in the 5th century BC , presented the first theory of atoms ( see article atomism for more details ) . The Greeks believed that atoms were all made of the same material but had different shapes and sizes , which determined the physical properties of the material . For instance , the atoms of a liquid were thought to be smooth , allowing them to slide over each other . This theory was not founded on experimental evidence.In 1808 , John Dalton proposed that an element is composed of a single , unique type of atoms , and that whilst their shape or structure was immutable , atoms of different elements could combine to form more complex structures ( compounds ) . Through his experiments , Dalton discovered the law of multiple proportions - that is , if two elements form more than one compound between them , then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers .",0
"Why should things like language change just for the sake of new generations ? Case in point . Language may change for clarity and definition , such as the reason for thee , thou , thy and thine . Ok , you , your , and yours , which I still believe are acceptable for Worship , and religious expressions ; The Spanish Language uses that form for familiarity among personal relatives ; but did you know that the words `` blessed '' , `` doth '' `` knowest '' and `` thinketh '' can be related to a `` lisp tongue '' ie , . `` All I want for Chrithmath ith my two front teeth '' . Therefore a word like blessed would be pronouced `` Blethed '' and thinks `` thinkth '' or phonetically `` thinketh '' .My real point , however , is that most of todays language changes are perverse , gutteral , and obscene . As for traditions ; only the most valuable ones , based upon morality and righteousness , are becoming extinct.I ask you ; what do you say ? Language does n't change for the sake of a new generation . The change had already started generations before . Who came up with the obscenities in the first place ? Who decided that these sounds when put together to make words would be vulgar ? This is an interesting question . Your examples are interesting , also . I 'm not sure it is quite that simple . I 'm thinking that you would need a nation of people to lose their teeth permanently for at least a couple of generations for the new pronunciation to take effect .",0

They need to be chipping in and helping you get things moving with more ease than it is now .

Keep clean by whatever means necessary and feel damn good for doing it ! Its far too easy to fall back into a bad routine when stress is high .

"what does an r3 code mean on a military dd214 in terms of re-enlistment ? It really depends on which branch of service you were in . In the Navy if you had an RE-3 it was usually followed with a letter code such as RE-3P which meant you got out on a physical . I got out with an RE-3Z which meant that I took SSB/VSI . As far as re-enlistment goes it really depends on the letter code that comes after . If you got an RE-3P for a shoulder injury and you want to come back in a few years after it heals ... maybe no problem . If you got out on a 3P for something more serious or dependancy ( drug/alcohol ) it seriously reduces your chances of re-enlistment . But do n't forget that each service has their own codes . So see your local recruiter first . The Marine Corps has only one code that is good for immediate re-enlistment ( RE-1A ) , anything other than that will keep you out of the Corps , but not necessarily out of the National Guard ( for example ) . If your particular RE code keeps you out of your original branch , check out other branches and do n't forget Guard and Reserves . Good luck in your military career .",0

It will climb slowly each month thereafter if you pay on time . So , do n't ever pay late . Secondly , a large part of your score is determined by the ratio of credit used to credit available . If you have a $ 1,000 limit on your card , DO NOT leave a balance on that card of over $ 500 . The lower your credit debt to credit limits , the better your score will be . Lastly , the longer you have credit , the better . Some people will cancel cards and accounts that are infrequently used . Do n't do that ! Leave them open . On the other hand , having too many credit accounts means you are a credit hog . Every time you apply for credit , your score will go down , for a few months .",0

I do n't want them to have to go through all the procedures I have . I took them with me to every visit I have had .

"Objections to Scott Hahn ? Are there any scholarly objections to Scott Hahn from Protestants ? I am not aware of any , except from the 'common-man ' . Schneb ? If so where can I find these objections ? For spiritual assistance in his conversion Hahn turned to praying the rosary , in which 153 of 170 prayers are offered to Mary . He writes in his conversion story , `` I proceeded to pray [ the rosary ] , and as I prayed I felt more in my heart what I came to know in my mind : I am a child of God . I do n't just have God as my Father and Christ as my brother ; I have His Mother for my own . '' Franciscan University , where Hahn is a professor , is one of the foremost promoters of tours to the shrine of Our Lady of Medjugorje.Now , if you have read my study , `` Seven Letters '' , you would see that there was a woman who deceived the church . According to the timeline , it is the doctrine of Mariology . So I have real problems with anyone who supports or does apologetics to this unbiblical doctrine.http : //www.schneblin.com/studies/pdfs/seven_letters.pdf",0

"why is the sky blue ? Space is black and the sun is like yellowish-orangish , so why blue , or sometimes gray The sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering . This effect was actually first observed and described by John Tyndall , and a only few years later was explored in more detail by Lord Rayleigh.Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of light by particles . In the case of the sky , these particles are the molecules of air , themselves , and not dust or water vapor as is often proferred . The scattering depends on the wavelength of the light . Light towards the violet end of the spectrum scatters more than light at the red end . Sunlight is scattered throughout the sky and causes it to appear blue to an observer on the ground . The reason the sky does n't appear violet to us has to do with the sensetivity of the cones in the human eye.Just as the blue light gets scattered , red light from the sun travels farther , which is why the sun appears yellowish-orangish . In space the sun appears noticeably more blue . Space is black because there are almost no particles to scatter light .",0

"How are North and South America considered one continent , but Europe and Asia are considered seperate ? This question ( http : //answers.yahoo.com/question/index ? qid=1006020706083 ) inspired my question . I was always taught that there are seven continents . I personally would consider Eurpoe and Asia to be united before I would ever consider North and South America to be united . If you think otherwise ( or if you agree with me ) , please explain your answer . All 7 continents were joined together billions of years ago . However through time , they gradually split up , resulting in North and South America , and Australia to be separate from the main body-Europe , Asia and Africa.I figured because Europe and Asia had different coloured people which each had their unique tradition and customs . As they ruled differently due to customs , tradition and prctices , they probably decided to each govern their own way and thus they spilt up into 'different continents ' , though Europe and Asia are on the same piece of land .",0

"give 1safety precaution should be taken when celestine is heated with carbon in a lab and reason ? Celestine is sometimes used to produce a red color in fireworks .

"am i at risk for std ? Hi , I have a concern and I was hoping that some of you might be able to help me . Last night my girlfriend came over to my house and we had unprotected vaginal sex . It was her first time ( meaning she was a virgin ) . There was no blood or anything like that at all . This is the first time that I have had unprotected sex . We didnt perform any oral sex though last night but we have in the past few weeks . I just wanted to know , if it 's possible that I caught anything ( even though she was a virgin ) . STD or HIV ? one last note : A girl performed oral sex on me last december ( early december ) . Does that influence anything ? Thank you in advance If your girl is a virgin and she has not been infected by any STD by sharing needles or bad blood transfusion you 're not going to catch anything from her.You can receive an STD by Salival transmission so if the girl who went down on you has an STD you may have received it.Remember that life is an STD . If you 're having unprotected vaginal sex you need to make sure you are at a point in your life where you 'll be able to support a child . If you 're not then you should take every precaution against pregnancy . Remember that the only method that is 100 % effective is abstinence ( well and oral I guess ) .",0

"Are there any Biblical verses that refute Mormon teachings ? Please explain. ? Way too many . Here is a good link to do some research.http : //www.carm.org/mormon.htmMormons not only claim to be Christians , but to be the only true Christians . According to them , the early Christian church went through an apostacy , lost the true teaching of God , and is built on a Bible that , according to them , is translated incorrectly and is missing many books.Interestingly , while LDS Church president Gordon Hinckley assures the press that `` the New Testament is a fundamental scripture for us , '' ( Note 1 ) he fails to point out the Mormons ' bias against the Bible.Article 8 of the Mormon Articles of Faith ( Note 2 ) says , `` We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it has been translated correctly . '' This approach allows Mormons to ignore key Bible Scriptures which refute Mormon doctrines . Bible verses used to counter Mormon teachings are brushed off in favor of passages from the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scriptures ( as well as ongoing revelation that often contradicts previous LDS Church teachings ) .It should be noted that the LDS Church has published its own version of the King James Bible , incorporating footnotes explaining what corrections from Joseph Smith 's `` inspired version '' of the Bible ( a version full of errors and plagiarized material ) should be taken into account.However , in spite of their efforts at revisionism , Mormons have not been able to support their claims . On the contrary . While Mormon allegations regarding the Bible and the course of Christianity are refuted by history , archeology , and other sciences , the scriptures of the Mormon church are problematic at every turn . Far from showing us so-called 'restored truth , ' they are testimonies to the deceptive nature of Mormonism .",0

If the problem is such that you can approximate the answer , then you can discretize the parameters as small slices of time and come up with an approximate answer - without using calculus .",0
"what is the purpose of throwing of beads at the Mardi Gras mean ? New Orleans ' Mardi Gras revelers will spend today downing Hurricanes , gawking at naked flesh , and begging paraders for colored beads with the traditional plea , `` Throw me something , mister ! '' How did the bead-throwing custom begin ? The first recorded instances of Mardi Gras paraders tossing souvenirs to the crowd date back to the 1840s , when revelers costumed as aristocrats threw out baubles and sugar-coated almonds . Other , less savory characters preferred `` trick '' to `` treat '' and pelted onlookers with an assortment of dirt , flour , and quicklime . The dissemination of handouts—or `` throws , '' in Mardi Gras parlance—is widely believed to have derived from festival customs in Renaissance Europe , where pre-Lenten carnivals often involved projectiles ( hurled about after villagewide ale-and-mead binges ) . Some historians theorize that the tradition has roots in a pagan post-winter ritual , during which lucky peasants who 'd survived the cold months celebrated by throwing milled grain into the fields—an offering of gratitude to the deity ( or deities ) who had given them enough food to last.Glass beads did not become a New Orleans Mardi Gras staple until the 1880s , after Anglo-American `` krewes '' had formed to organize the loose-knit festivities . Legend has it that the first parade participant to use beads was a man dressed up as Santa Claus ; the ornamental strands were such a hit that other krewes picked up on the ritual . By 1900 , when at least 100,000 tourists a year flocked to the Crescent City for Mardi Gras , beaded throws were ubiquitous.Continue Articlewhy you fly nationalToday 's plastic-or-aluminum beads have earned substantial notoriety for their role in a sexual bartering system ; women often bare their breasts for a strand or two . ( And sometimes go the Full Monty for a particularly enticing throw . ) Despite claims that this custom dates back decades , a 1996 paper in the academic journal Social Forces could trace the beads-for-nudity movement only back to the 1970s.Bonus Explainer : A krewe known as `` Zulu '' has become famous for handing out ( not throwing ) Mardi Gras coconuts in lieu of beads . The practice ceased briefly in the 1980s , owing to liability concerns—no insurance company would cover Zulu , fearing that an errant coconut might dent a merrymaker 's skull . Zulu leaders appealed to the Louisiana state legislature , pointing out that beads and other Mardi Gras trinkets were exempted from liability laws . In 1987 , then-Governor Edwin Edwards signed the `` Coconut Bills , '' adding Zulu 's heavy , oblong handouts to the list .",0

"Why was an embargo put on Cuba ? `` When , on January 7 , 1959 , Fidel Castro assumed control of Cuba after President Fulgencio Batista fled on December 31 , the U.S. government initially supported the Cuban Revolution , formally recognizing the new government . However , relations rapidly deteriorated when the new Cuban government passed the first Agrarian Reform Law to begin expropriation of large-scale ( largely American-owned ) land holdings on May 17 , 1959 . The compensation offered ( based on 20-year bonds at 4.5 % interest for the tax-assessed value ) was seen as inadequate , and was rejected by American interests . Animosity escalated with the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis . After that , the U.S. promised never to invade Cuba again , but resorted to financial measures instead . `` This embargo initially caused damage to the Cuban economy , but 45 years later , has very little effect .

Unfortunately it was discovered that electrons actually flow from - to + in an external wire , but it was too late and we live with convention now . In a way it really does n't matter as long as all circuit designers agree on the convention since we can not see electrons ; unless you are designing a vacuum tube ( etc . ) where electrons must physically flow from a heated element that boils them off to a grounded plate that collects them .

"Any economists out there ? Student who needs help ! ! ? I 'm in college , & need help with my macroeconomics class . I took a quiz , and got 5 questions wrong . My teacher is disputing that they 're wrong , but I say they 're right ! ! Thank you in advance for your help . The questions are : The ability-to-pay tax principle ca n't be applied to : ( she said the correct answer was welfare ) . The ability to pay tax principle states that : Those with a greater ability to pay ( such as those with a higher income , or those who own more property ) should pay more taxes . I do n't see how welfare ( or her other choices of post office , & highway ) fit into this principle . Yes , we as users of the highway & post offices pay taxes , ( these services are supplied by the government ) but people that use welfare also pay taxes . The only way I can see this to be a part of it , is that highways can make money by tolls & post offices by postage , & welfare is giving money away to citizens . Thank you , and I have 4 more , but no space to post , so I 'm going to do individual questions . Welfare is essentially a negative tax , which goes right in hand with the ability-to-pay tax principle . They so lack an ability to pay that they are instead paid by the Social Security Insurance tax that everyone who can pay does .",0

"why are women not as straight forward as men are ... ? Women are taught to answer in a non-threatening indirect way from the time they are very little girls . Little girls are told to `` Be nice .

"How long is the average penis ? What is the length of the longest docuemnted penis ? Your penis is like an artist ’ s paintbrush . It ’ s not how long it is that matters . It ’ s how skillfully you use it and how many different brush strokes you know.These penis size questions come up again and again on this site . Women almost always say it doesn ’ t matter to them . And if it actually does matter to a small minority of women , so what ? There are still plenty left who don ’ t think it ’ s very important . What ’ s far more important is whether you ’ re skilled at using your penis to satisfy your woman . Can you last as long as you want ? Can you vary the depth of your strokes , the pace of them , the angle of them , so that you can offer your woman a little teasing and unpredictability at times ? Are you skilled enough at other ways to pleasure her , so that penis-vagina intercourse is only one of the things on the menu you offer her ? Even if you can ’ t do all of these things at present , these are all things you can LEARN to do .

"What is the best treatment for canker sores ? Any way to promote healing or maybe reduce the pain ? Canker sores usually go away without any treatment . For pain relief , you can try taking ibuprofen ( brand name : Advil ) or acetaminophen ( brand name : Tylenol ) . Other medicines , such as Anbesol , Oragel , Orabase and Zilactin-B , might keep your canker sores from becoming irritated by eating , drinking or brushing your teeth . You put these medicines right on the sore.You can also mix equal amounts of Milk of Magnesia and Benadryl Allergy liquid . After it 's mixed , you can swish a teaspoonful in your mouth for about 1 minute and then spit it out . If you do this every 4 to 6 hours , your canker sores may hurt less.Some people think that sucking on zinc lozenges , taking vitamin C or vitamin B complex , using a sage-and-chamomile mouthwash or taking a lysine supplement helps their canker sores heal faster .",0
"Why do people have five fingers instead of six or seven ?

Yet { some early vertebrates ] had 7 toes ... .8 toes ... .6 toes . ... My tentative guess is thatin those early times the different species really did benefit from their respective numbers of toes ... Later the tetrapod limb design hardened at 5 digits because some internal embryonic process came to rely upon that number . In the adult the number is frequently reduced ... in..modern horses to just one , the middle toe . ''",0

"Would Americans like for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state ? Puerto Rico has been a colony for more than 100 years of the US and once again the isue has come up to decide for its political future , independence or statehood . I 'm sure Americans do n't want Puerto Rico to become a state . With a population larger than that of many other states , PR would be more powerful in Congress than those less populated states.As to FL Boy 's answer , I 'd say that although it would never become a major player , as an independent nation , PR definitely would n't be worthless in the world 's economy . it happens that PR is the world 's largest producer of prescription medicines and pacemakers.My comment on One 's answer is that thousands of Puerto Ricans serve and have served in all of the military branches of the U.S . They have also fought and died in the wars fought by the US , including Iraq and Desert Storm . During the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) , the 65th Infantry Division , made up entirely of Puerto Ricans , kicked some seroius North Korean behinds .

"Why does society feel that they have the right to impose their opinion on others ? When an issue is one where there will be no viable consequence to society but is of a completly personal nature . ie abortion , religion , etc ... Why do people feel they have the right to force others to live the way they 've chosen instead of leaving these issues up to the person who will be affected by their choice . Abortion and religious decisions should absolutely be made only by yourself only . You are absolutely right how people try to impose their beliefs onto others .

"What is nesidioblastomia ? It 's disease of some kind , but I am not sure what it is . nesidioblastosis Nesidioblastosis is a controversial medical term for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia attributed to an abnormal microscopic appearance of pancreatic islet development . The term was coined in the first half of the 20th century . The abnormal histologic aspects of the tissue included the presence of islet cell enlargement , islet cell dysplasia , beta cells budding from ductal epithelium , and islets in apposition to ducts.By the 1970s , nesidioblastosis was primarily used to describe the pancreatic dysfunction associated with persistent congenital hyperinsulinism and in most cases from the 1970s until the 1970s , it was used as a synonym for what we now refer to as congenital hyperinsulinism.The term fell into disfavor after it was recognized in the late 1980s that the characteristic tissue features were sometimes seen in pancreatic tissue from normal infants and even adults , and is not consistently associated with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia . Most congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by different mechanisms than excessive proliferation of beta cells in a fetal pattern.A small number of case reports have purported to describe nesidioblastosis in adults",0
"What kind of psychotherapy works the best ? The answer to your question is not easy . Some therapists use a limited approach ( ie . only interpersonal , focused on your relationships with others . ) In my opinion , CBT ( Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy ) is often successful if other approaches have failed . I am the maintainer of a portal called http : //health.wikispaces.com that is helping to answer ( I hope ) precisely these kinds of questions . It is Invitation-Only , so that it is not open to misinformation . ( people who can access the site can also edit it to add their own research , and experiences . ) The answer to your question is that depending on the reason you are seeking psychotherapy , different methods will work best.I think this is really a multistep question , so I am going to give you some sources of information and then ask you to come back for a follow-up.WebMD.com , using experts from the Cleveland clinic ( WebMD uses different sources , some of which are not very comforting ) , has a detailed article on psychotherapy I highly recommend : http : //www.webmd.com/content/article/60/67128.htmI am going to add to this . The first thing you should discuss with any therapist is what brought you to see them , and what your goals are , and also billing . Insurance will often cover up to a certain amount ; some therapists or social workers ( both do therapy to some degree ) work on a sliding pay scale ( ie . they negociate on rate you pay . ) http : //www.webmd.com/content/article/60/67128.htmMy local counselor here at Earlham College in Richmond , IN says that eclectic therapists are the best -- ie . the ones that can use any approach that seems helpful . ( She has a Masters in Social Work . ) Therapists vary . Some are really good and give you specific directed guidance . Techniques are being researched all the time . I just saw a really good article on 'resellience therapy ' which sounded really cool . ( If you are interested , I will provide you with the link . ) Let me know how I can best assist you ! -- Sam , journalist and healer of myself",0

"What do you think of President Bush sellin our ports to Arabs ? Update : `` He became aware of it over the last several days , '' McClellan said . Asked if Bush did not know about it until it was a done deal , McClellan said , `` That 's correct . `` First of all , I just want to say that it 's obvious not `` all Arabs are terrorists '' and objection to this port deal is not suggesting in the least bit that they are . You see a lot of the educated Congressmen , of both parties , objecting to the sale of these ports to a UAE company . These are intelligent , educated people and you think that they are objecting to this deal because they believe that all Arabs are terrorists ? I think not . The first perons who answered this question is the one who needs to get educated.It is justifiable to say that giving control of these major US ports to a company in the UAE poses a threat to national security . This situation is comparable to the notion of `` probable cause . '' If a police officer sees a person driving dangerously and erratically he has reason to believe that this person might be intoxicated . If two of the September 11 hijackers came from the UAE and money used to fund those attacks went through UAE banks , we have reason to believe that giving control of major ports to a UAE company is an added threat to security.There is no argument against the fact the UAE is located in a region of the world where anti-Western sentiment is strong . UAE control of these ports gives people a greater opportunity to act of these feelings.Sorry to say , but there is a difference between a British company operating these ports and a UAE company operating these ports . I am a strong supporter of President Bush on 95 % of the issues , but I do not know where his head is regarding this issue , if he really did know about this before the deal was made .",0

"can any one tells me about ellen de generes ? ELLEN DEGENERES Host and Executive Producer of her own t.v . show . `` Ellen '' Date of birth ( location ) 26 January 1958Metairie , Louisiana , USA A beloved television icon and entertainment pioneer , Ellen DeGeneres ' distinctive comic voice has resonated with audiences from her first stand-up comedy appearances through her work today on television , in film and in the literary world.DeGeneres has made a home for herself in the daytime arena with her hit syndicated talk show , `` The Ellen DeGeneres Show , ” now in its third season , the show has won nine Daytime Emmys , including Outstanding Talk Show in its first two seasons and Outstanding Talk Show Host . Additionally , DeGeneres won the People ’ s Choice Awards two years in a row for Favorite Daytime Talk Show Host and Favorite Funny Female Star . She also won the Producers Guild Award this past year for Outstanding Variety Television Show . `` The Ellen DeGeneres Show '' was launched in September 2003 to great success . In its freshman year , the show won four Daytime Emmys , including Outstanding Talk Show , after garnering a record twelve nominations . In its second season , the show won five Daytime Emmys.In 2005 , DeGeneres appears in the American Express ad campaign `` My Life , My Card , '' including a national commercial and a print campaign shot by famed photographer Annie Liebowitz . The campaign provided DeGeneres the opportunity to produce and star in a short film for the Tribeca Film Festival , entitled `` My Short Film , '' a short film about making short films . The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival and viewable online.Prior to the launch of her talk show , DeGeneres scored a rare coup in 2004 with simultaneous achievements on stage , film and in the literary world . She enjoyed unprecedented popular and critical response to her character , 'Dory , ' the fish with extreme short term memory , in the blockbuster Disney/Pixar animated feature film , `` Finding Nemo . '' Written and directed by Andrew Stanton , and co-starring Albert Brooks and Willem Dafoe among others , the Academy Award winner for Best Animated Film has made over $ 850 million dollars worldwide to date , making it one of the highest grossing computer-animated films in history , as well as one of the highest domestic grossing films of 2003 . In addition , DeGeneres was nominated for a 2004 MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance for her work in the film . DeGeneres crossed the country on a 35-city stand-up comedy tour , entitled the `` Here and Now '' tour . The series of shows included a performance at the famed Beacon Theater in New York , which was taped for HBO . The resulting special aired on June 28th , 2003 and scored higher ratings than any HBO comedy special had in years . It was subsequently nominated for two Emmys including Outstanding Individual Performance In A Variety Or Music Program and Outstanding Variety , Music Or Comedy Special . HBO followed by releasing the special on DVD . In October , 2003 , Simon & Schuster published DeGeneres ' second book , The Funny Thing Is ... , comprised of the author 's comedic short stories and essays . The book hit the New York Times ' Bestseller list upon its release . In 2005 , DeGeneres was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for the audio version of the book . A performer with a keen sense of comedy in the moment , DeGeneres garnered rave reviews for her performance hosting the 2001 Primetime Emmy Awards . Taking the reins of the high profile event with assuredness , she provided a perfect balance of wit with heartfelt emotion and gave the post-September 11th telecast audience a reason to laugh . DeGeneres ' career began as an emcee at a local comedy club in her hometown of New Orleans , which led to national recognition in 1982 when her videotaped club performances won Showtime 's `` Funniest Person In America .

"How did `` black comedy '' and `` rap music '' evolved from minstrel shows in America ? Minstrel shows were obstensibly a caricature of African-American culture , reaching the height of their popularity in the mid-19th Century.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_showBy and large , rap and hip-hop developed in the 1970 's as a natural progression from disco , jazz , beat poetry , raggae , and other African Diasporic cultural genres interacting with each other and creating something new.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_musicHumor , as an entertainment genre , created and performed by African-Americans does n't have much of a presence in American popular culture until the 70's.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_sitcomhttp : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special : Search ? search=african+american+comedians & go=GoIn this way , there 's not much of a direct relationship between minstrel shows and contemporary African-American entertainment in terms of `` lineage . '' However , racism - of which minstrel shows are one example - is a frequent topic of discussion.Example - In the `` When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong '' sketch of Chappelle 's Show Season 2 episode 7 : Dave plays Vernon Franklin , an African-American yuppie who feels like an `` Uncle Tom '' because he likes and gets along with his white co-workers . So instead of letting an awkward comment from co-worker and mentor Frank Murphy slide , he over-reacts.Frank : Vernon , great job buddy . You da man ! Give me some skin , huh ? Vernon : Get your m*f*in hand out of my face , man . You heard me m*f*er get your hand out of my face ! What you think this is - just shake my hand like a man ! .. ' Gim me some five , on the black-hand side , with all this crazy jive ' ? That 's b*s* . Do you want a little soft-shoe ? Should I juggle some watermelon ? Man ; f* all that ! Obviously , the humor is in the over-reaction . But at the same time , Chappelle is tapping into the sensitivity many people have concerning racial stereotypes : The comment about `` dancing a soft-shoe '' is a direct reference to minstrel show caricaturing of African-Americans .",0

He believes he has sleep apnea , but we do not have the money to test for this . Anyone else experience this and can reccomend a solution thayt worked for them ? Your boyfriend needs to seriously consider testing for sleep apnea , especially if the snoring seems to be throat-based . I 'll just bet he has it , too . Age is not a factor ; I am told kids as young as 12 can have it.I have it and did n't know it . For me , it was n't a snoring issue ; it was an issue with not getting a restful night 's sleep . I 'd wake up in the morning and feel completely exhausted.I was tested three years ago and was shocked to find out that I stopped breathing 30 times in three hours , which essentially woke me up . When the clinic stirred me , they put me on a CPAP ( controlled positive air pressure machine ) and I fell into deep REM sleep for the first time in I ca n't remember . Since then , I use the CPAP every night and sleep like a baby . You will , too.I ca n't stress enough the health implications of this beyond the lack of sleep . It is a severe drag on the heart and respiratory system.I ca n't speak to your financial issues , but medical insurance should cover this if your doctor makes the referral.According to my doctor , surgery has only a 35 % success rate .

"sri lankan histore ? The Sinhalese arrived in Sri Lanka late in the 6th century B.C. , probably from northern India . Buddhism was introduced beginning in about the mid-third century B.C. , and a great civilization developed at the cities of Anuradhapura ( kingdom from circa 200 B.C . to circa A.D. 1000 ) and Polonnaruwa ( from about 1070 to 1200 ) . In the 14th century , a south Indian dynasty seized power in the north and established a Tamil kingdom . Occupied by the Portuguese in the 16th century and by the Dutch in the 17th century , the island was ceded to the British in 1796 , became a crown colony in 1802 , and was united under British rule by 1815 . As Ceylon , it became independent in 1948 ; its name was changed to Sri Lanka in 1972 . Tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil separatists erupted into war in 1983 . Tens of thousands have died in an ethnic conflict that continues to fester .

My hiking buddy/co worker went to bed with a hot water nalgene between his thighs one night . He thought that was clever because a LOT of blood passes through there and warm blood travels to other parts of the body , warming them . But he woke up with blisters on his thighs ... dangerously close to the family jewels . Last word about hot water bottle , if you use a collapsible canteen or bottle , make sure you fill it allllll the way up , because even then your bottle will cave in as the water cools down . At the very least you want to minimize this so you do n't ruin your bottle . If the bottle cools this way , it will never hold as much as it used to.A good camping mat . The closed cell foam ones that roll up are cheap and effective and very lightweight , the next step up is the self inflating ones but they are heavier . And you can buy covers for those inflating mats that convert them into a chair.You need to dress warm . The most effective thing in my opinion , and also more versatile , is to dress in multiple light layers . In the winter , I wear about 8 layers in the coldest weather ... long john shirt , tee shirt , maybe a button down shirt , a fleece vest , as many fleece crewneck tops ( the fuzzy polartec type , not sweathshirt fleece ) as I can pile on , and my rain jacket . The good news is that if I can add or remove pieces at will until I am perfectly comfortable . IF you go the other route of a couple indoor layers and then one big poofy piece you need to understand the principles of loft , which includes your sleeping bag.Loft is the way insulation in a comforter , parka , or sleeping bag works . They create tiny little air pockets around you and hold YOUR OWN body heat in them . IF you have a lot of clothing between you and the insulating item , you will actually defeat the purpose of the item because you insulate the item FROM your body heat . This is why many things are true : it is better to sleep with fewer clothing items when you want to be warmer in the bag . It is also important not to compromise loft by choosing an item that does n't fit your body and causes you to squash it from the inside out , or with a bunch of heavy layers on top of it to squash it from the outside in . If you compress your item too much , even in storage , or in your pack or its stuff sack , there are fewer air pockets formed and the item does n't work as well.SO choose ONE dressing strategy and know how to apply it.Other important facts : All the things discussed so far are only ways to insulate yourself . They are not generating any heat on their own . To do that , you need to DRINK plenty of water , and you need to EAT , warm foods that are high in sugars and fats are excellent , and you need to MOVE . A bedtime snack can be anything from a candy bar to a stick of butter , NO kidding ! A bedtime activity could be a couple minutes jumping up and down , then one last go at the fire . AND YOU MUST DRINK WATER . Even if you ca n't stand cold liquids . EVEN IF you do n't want to be up all night peeing . Your body needs the water to circulate the blood , and to metabolize food , both of which assist you in staying warm . Another thing you need to know about water is that both dehydration and hypothermia have the early warning sign of disorientation and confusion . The trouble is , if YOU are the one",0

"a canadien hockey player in 1985 ? a canadien hockey player in 1985 On February 22 , 2002 , Wayne Gretzky made history as the architect of Canada 's first gold medal in Olympic men 's hockey in 50 years . It proved that three years after retirement , `` The Great One 's '' contribution to the game and country he loves is not over.Gretzky was only ten years old when his talent as the defenceman-winger-centre for the Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers caught the attention of Toronto Telegram sportswriter John Iaboni . His story about the prolific 369-goal scorer turned out to be a glimpse of what was in store for the greatest hockey player to lace up a pair of skates . Gretzky was born on January 26 , 1961 . By age two his father and `` greatest coach , '' Walter already had his son on skates . By the time he joined the Nadrofsky Steelers , he already had a reputation of carving out scoring opportunities against players twice his age and taller than his modest height.At 15 , he joined the Ontario Hockey Association , turning professional two years later as an underage junior with the Indianapolis Racers in the now defunct World Hockey Association ( WHA ) . He only played eight games for the Racers ( chalking up three goals and three assists ) before being traded to the WHA 's Edmonton Oilers where he was named WHA Rookie of the Year.In 1979 , the Edmonton Oilers entered the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . Gretzky remained in Edmonton nine seasons , leading the Oilers to four Stanley Cups , and helping to build hockey 's strongest franchise of the 1980s.Not surprisingly , Gretzky 's trade to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988 made front-page news and topped all national newscasts . Gretzky was the ambassador of hockey ; the struggling Kings needed to fill seats , and the NHL wanted to promote its game in the United States.Since joining the NHL , Gretzky has had more impact on the record book than any other player . By the time he retired , The Great One held over 60 NHL records and most of the sport 's prestigious hardware , including nine Hart Trophies for most valuable player and five Lester B. Pearson Trophies for MVP as voted by other players.His most cherished record , however , came on October 25 , 1989 , when he scored two goals and an assist to surpass the all-time points record set by his hero , Gordie Howe.Wayne Gretzky retired from professional hockey as a New York Ranger on April 18 , 1999 . In addition to the NHL , and his considerable charity work , he has made Canadians proud on the world stage - particularly as Executive Director of Team Canada for the 2002 Winter Olympics . Additionally , Gretzky is part owner of the Phoenix Coyotes.Canada 's Walk of Fame Trivia : Wayne Gretzky 's first jersey was No . 9 after his hockey hero , Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings .",0

It is the one and only Ancient Wonder that does not need speculations concerning its appearance , size , and shape . It is the oldest , yet it is the only surviving of the Seven Ancient Wonders . It is the Great Pyramid of Giza . * The Hanging Gardens of Babylon Some stories indicate the Hanging Gardens towered hundreds of feet into the air , but archaeological explorations indicate a more modest , but still impressive , height . * The Statue of Zeus at Olympia This is a statue of the God in whose honor the Ancient Olympic games were held . It was located on the land that gave its very name to the Olympics . At the time of the games , wars stopped , and athletes came from Asia Minor , Syria , Egypt , and Sicily to celebrate the Olympics and to worship their king of Gods : Zeus . * The Colossus of Rhodes The island of Rhodes was an important economic centre in the ancient world . It is located off the southwestern tip of Asia Minor where the Aegean Sea meets the Mediterranean . The capitol city , also named Rhodes , was built in 408 B.C * The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus Eight hundred years after its destruction , the magnificent Temple of Artemis at Ephesus , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , had been completely forgotten by the people of the town that had once held it in such pride… * The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is the burial place of an ancient king . Yet the Mausoleum is different - so different from the Pyramid that it earned its reputation - and a spot within the list - for other reasons . Geographically , it is closer to the Temple of Artemis ... And it was the beauty of the tomb rather than its size that fascinated its visitors for years . * The Pharos of Alexandria ( The Lighthouse of Alexandria ) Of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , only one had a practical use in addition to its architectural elegance : The Lighthouse of Alexandria . For sailors , it ensured a safe return to the Great Harbor . For architects , it meant even more : it was the tallest building on Earth . And for scientists , it was the mysterious mirror that fascinated them most ... The mirror which reflection could be seen more than 50 km ( 35 miles ) off-shore.Of those , opnly the Pyramids remain today.There are more modern wonders : * Great Pyramid of Giza* Great Wall of China* Taj Mahal* Serengeti Migration* Galapagos Islands* Grand Canyon* Machu PicchuModern world : * Channel Tunnel* CN Tower* Empire State Building* Golden Gate Bridge* Itaipu Dam* Netherlands ' Tidal Defences* Panama CanalNatural wonders : * Grand Canyon* Great Barrier Reef* Harbor of Rio de Janeiro* Mount Everest* Northern Lights* Paricutín volcano* Victoria FallsUnderwater wonders : PalauBelize Barrier ReefGreat Barrier ReefDeep-Sea VentsGalapagos IslandsLake BaikalNorthern Red Sea",0

They can occur at any age , but they often appear when you 're between 40 and 60 years of age . Sometimes they run in families . Sometimes they are caused by an injury . Most lipomasdo not hurt unless they are squeezed or bruised.Because lipomas are almost always benign ( not cancer ) , they usually do not need treatment .

Your doctor can help you decide what is best for you.As always , check with your doctor to make sure it is a lipoma and to discuss treatment .",0

Play Madden , watch the games on TV , play with your buddies . More important than knowing the plays are your fundamental skills .

Muslims are terrorists if all Germans are nazis , Americans are gangsters , Columbians are drug dealers , Italians are mafia members and ... .I think thats because the only news from muslims which news companies spread is about terrorism.Propaganda has great powers and it can make you believe that muslims are terrorist.After cold war when the danger of communism vanished western governments need an enemy and there was n't anyone better than muslims.Maybe it is true that some famous terrorist are muslim but it is also true that muslim countries have suffered from many unwanted problems e.g . afghanestan which was american front during cold war for controlling the communism movement in middle east which is one of the most important oil producers in world and believe me , there is nothing remained there except ruined cities and mountain and minefield and vast fields of poppy which is used to make opium and heroin in great amounts . this is a proper place for terrorism to grow . so I think muslims are wrongfuly accused .",0

"How does one approach a total jerk coach who is mean , unsensitve and hurtful to my daughter ? She is 16 and loves basket - but the coach ( who is the head of the association unfortunately ) is a horrible person . She refuses to quit the team but is terribly unhappy , sometimes cries , does n't want to talk about it in detail and does n't want us to talk to him . I wish she would quit but she refuses . I see her terribly upset - what can we do ? She thinks she can continue suffering , but I think he tries to get her to quit . A total unsensitive ... ... .. ! Well ... getting too involved will embarass your daughter and possibly even make it harder for her to stay on the team , which she obviously wants . Kudos to her for sticking withit even when it upsets her ! Make your presence known to the coach but dont try to confront him or tell him what to do . I am a swimming coach , and when a parent goes out of their way to thank me or let me know they appreciate what I am doing , then I am more positive to the kids as a whole . Try being ridiculously nice to the jerk . Come a little early to a practice one day and watch the end , and then when all the girls go to the locker rooms walk up to the coach , introduce yourself , and tell him that the kids seem to be doing such a wonderful job and that you are so pleased with the progress they are all making . Making yourself as NICE as possible will make it harder for him to be mean to your daughter.Then , tell your daughter how proud of her you are for sticking with it even when its hard for her . This is a big deal for someone so young , and it says a lot about her character . Good luck !",0

"is buffy the vampire slayer postmodern ? if so why ? In a word , yes . The longer version is that BtVS is a piece of postmodern art because : '' In terms of popular culture and mass media , there has been a large push towards the postmodern tendency of `` bricolage , pastiche and intertextuality '' ( Altman , 1999:141 ) in recent years . In regards to BtVS , the series creator , Joss Whedon , has stated when he was forming the character of Buffy he thought of `` the little girl , the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed , in every horror movie . The idea of Buffy was to subvert that idea , that image , and create someone who was a hero where she had always been a victim . That element of surprise , that element of genre busting is very much at the heart of the series '' ( 2001 ) . The notion of `` genre busting '' is found in the postmodern mixing of horror , comedy and drama , and results in the playful deconstruction of genre conventions , forcing the audience to question their assumed knowledge of the 'rules ' of a particular genre , such as the formal repetitive structure of horror films ( Dika , 1987:87 ) '' Therefore , the primary reason why the show can be considered postmodern is that , from its very inception , the show was intended to flip and subvert the horror movie standard of the blonde girl being slain by the monster in the dark alley . BtVS also goes on to subvert standard readings of text and narrative by becoming extra-textual or outside of the text , by making transgressive allusions and references . Buffy 's postmodernism comprises not only self-awareness but also awareness of other shows , movies , books and anything else , including referring to Martha Stewart as a demon.Postmodernism also often defines itself by what it is not . In the case of Buffy , the show ( and its creator ) often defines itself by setting itself apart from something else . Thus , for instance , in Buffy many episodes , scenes or lines start with a cliché and then move on from it to subvert that cliché or exaggerate it in unconventional ways for dramatic purposes . This is demonstrated most clearly when a character questions a commonly used saying . For instance , in the season 2 episode , 'Lie to Me ' , Willow wonders why people say 'sticks out like a sore thumb ' : Xander : In no way do we stick out like sore thumbs . Willow : Okay , but do they really stick out ? Xander : What ? Willow : Sore thumbs . Do they stick out ? I mean , have you ever seen a thumb and gone , 'Wow ! That baby is sore ! ' Xander : You have too many thoughts.Another example is the show 's original conceit : the cliche that high school can be hell is given a postmodern twist by creating a show in which high school was literally on the mouth of hell .",0

"do other premenopausal women have incredibly painful high-flow periods after skipping two or three months ? Consider this ... It 's possible that your `` high-flow periods '' are not actual periods at all , but just your body becoming unable to hold all the blood that has collected in the uterus due to not having a period for two to three months . The body `` releases '' the blood , and then goes back to not having `` periods '' until there is again too much blood to hold . This is one of the experiences caused by an endocrine disorder called PCOS ( polycystic ovarian syndrome ) that can cause erratic or skipped periods , and can cause exactly the painful high-flow `` periods '' of which you speak . You should visit an endocrinologist and have the doctor check your hormone levels to make sure that everything is normal . PCOS can be treated with medication and diet . There are other symptoms to the disorder as well , and if left untreated , the disorder can cause long term health problems such as diabetes or heart disease .",0

"Is mastarbation harmful for health ? Health and psychological effectsIt is held in many mental health circles that masturbation can relieve depression and lead to a higher sense of self-worth . Masturbation can also be particularly useful in relationships where one partner wants more sex than the other—in which case masturbation provides a balancing effect and thus a more harmonious relationship.Both from the standpoint of avoiding unwanted pregnancy and that of avoiding sexually transmitted diseases , masturbation is the safest of sexual practices . There is no credible scientific or medical evidence that manual masturbation is damaging to either one 's mental or physical health.A man whose penis has suffered `` an invasive procedure , blunt trauma or injury during intercourse '' [ 2 ] may suffer later in life from Peyronie 's disease . Usually in the context of an abnormal tunica albuginea , the rare event of penile fracture [ 3 ] may occur . Phimosis is `` a contracted foreskin ( that ) may cause trouble by hurting when an attempt is made to pull the foreskin back '' [ 4 ] . In each of these cases , overly aggressive manipulation of the penis can be problematic.Contrary to popular myth , masturbation does not cause blindness . There is some basis , however , to the myth : zinc is required both to transport vitamin A from the liver to the retina and is excreted in relatively high amount in semen . Thus , it is not inconceivable that in zinc-deficient or vitamin A-deficient environments excessive male masturbation could have caused night blindness ( in which case sexual intercourse has an equal probability of causing blindness ) . Given a normal contemporary diet , however , this is extremely unlikely to happen . There is also the more modern issue of staring at a computer screen while watching pornography for extended periods of time as the pupils tend to dilate during arousal.The only side-effects recorded are that repeated masturbation may result in tiredness or soreness , which tend to make repeated masturbation self-limiting in any case . For men , the volume of ejaculate is temporarily reduced after multiple ejaculations until normal seminal volume is regained in a day or so . Nevertheless , people may experience feelings of guilt during or after masturbation , especially if they come from a socially conservative or religious background.Solitary masturbation carries no risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases . Masturbation involving both a man and a woman can result in pregnancy only if semen contacts the vulva . Any masturbation with a partner can theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted disease by contact with bodily fluids , and such contact should be avoided with any partner whose disease status is uncertain . Objects inserted into the vagina or anus should be clean and of a kind that will not scratch or break . Care should be taken not to fully insert anything into the anus—any object used should have a flared or flanged base ; otherwise retrieval can require a visit to the emergency room . Most modern dildos and anal plugs are designed with this feature.In 1994 , when the first woman appointed Surgeon General of the United States , Dr. Joycelyn Elders , mentioned as an aside that perhaps it ought to be mentioned in school curricula that masturbation was safe and healthy , she was forced to resign , with opponents asserting that she was promoting the teaching of how to masturbate . Many believe this was the result of her long history of promoting controversial viewpoints and not due solely to her public mention of masturbation . Her case led to the coining of a new and humorous slang term for masturbation : Firing the surgeon general.On July 16 , 2003 , an Australian research team led by Graham Giles of The Cancer Council published a medical study [ 5 ] which concluded that frequent masturbation by males may help prevent the development of prostate cancer . The study also indicated that this would be more helpful than ejaculati",0

"If satan had appeared as a man instead of a serpent , would Eve had said `` No-way '' ?

Your desire will be for your husband '' to mean to attack or desire his leadership , I thought perhaps the desire would have been there at the fall , ( since Adam 's pass-through instruction of God 's command was ultimately ignored ) and had satan appeared as a man , would she have rejected his recommendation , much like today ?

"what does center do really ? i 'm new to this sport but i like it very much.can anybody teach me a little Typically , the center is the tallest man on the floor . Traditional centers stay close to the basket on offense , where they can use their size to get good shots because they are so close . Often these are dunks , layups , put backs ( shots off of a rebound ) , or hook shots . They 're also expected to be the best rebounders , since they are taller than everyone else.On defense , centers again stay close to the basket because if a guard or forward gets around the person defending them , the center can still slide over and block or alter the shot ( since presumably , he is taller than the player trying to shoot ) . They are again expected to rebound.Non-traditional centers , particularly those from foreign countries ( no idea why ) , move farther from the basket to shoot . Some , like China 's Wang Zhu-Zhu , are actually good three point shooters . Having a center like this is sometimes considered an advantage , since traditional centers are not used to guarding a player far from the basket .",0

"while visiting Appomattox I noticed that the grave markers were covered with coins . What is the reason for thi There are many theories why people place coins and other `` offerings '' on headstones . I have seen this at many historic sites , Calvin Coolidge grave etc.1 . Some say money left at graveside goes back to the coins left at graves in ancient Greece to pay Charon , for ferry passage over the River Styx to Hades.2 . It is a widespread custom to leave a small remembrance as a sign of respect in many cultures.3 . It may be a secular version of the Jewish tradition of putting a pebble on the gravestone to show remembrance and respect.In `` The Jewish Home : a guide for Jewish living : by Daniel B. Syme it says the following : > > '' In biblical times , ... graves were sometimes marked by a pile of stones . Some scholars suggest that this may explain the custom of leaving pebbles . There is no religious basis for the practice . It serves to indicate that loved ones have been to the grave , and that alone is sufficient cause to justify it . At least one contemporary rabbi , however , has suggested that leaving a stone may also have therapeutic benefit for us , especially if we see it as a symbolic means of leaving behind some of the 'hardness ' of grief and pain .

Too young to be cast as leading lady , she started with bit roles only , but was not missed , and quickly graduated to lead roles in low budget movies . She was extremely versatile , beautiful , charming , and stole everybody 's heart by her captivating looks and inspired performances in each of her film . She quickly out-shadowed and dethroned the established queens in a very short time because of her histrionics . Mumtaz was sensitive , quick to understand and translate every nuance hinted at , onto the screen . Even in her brief roles against established actresses , she was the one who got noticed more and lingered in viewers memories for longer periods . She acted in more than 100 films during a short career span of 14 years , and there is not even a single film in which her performance could not be termed as excellent . In her very first film with significant banner and role , Khilona ( 1970 ) , she won the most coveted Filmfare award in 1970 . She has also been awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by Filmfare in 1997 . She was in the Marilyn Monroe mould ; every man 's fantasy woman . She outshone everybody because of the simple reason that she was so versatile that every role appeared as if it was written with just Mumtaz in mind . Whether the role was negative or positive , serious or light , she proved her worth . Whether the role was for an urbanite or rustic , majestic or pauper , innocent or vile , gentle or venomous , coy or flaunting , Mumtaz just fitted them like a glove . The public adulation for her is still strong . The response to the continuous spate of screening of her movies on various television channels , even after more than two decades of her self-retirement , proves her tremendous unending popularity due to her incomparable charisma .",0

"What 's the best way to lose weight ? Start eating fruits such as pineapple , grape , pappaya , watermelon , mango , kiwi , strawberry etc as much as you want . Two hours later , eat a large salad with everything except meat , fish , or egg . Two hours after ( at least ) eat the dinner with your favarite meat , fish , etc . Do not go for seconds . Drink a glass of water just before eating the dinner , this will help you not to want to go for seconds , and using a small plate also will help . Drink 7 glasses of water all through out the day . One more thing do not eat anything three hours before going to sleep only water if the urge comes up.Keep doing this for a week , you will loose weight in a healthy way , and this will help you keep it off as well because you are eating everything you want to eat and you do not have the feeling of hunger or thirst . The fruits in the morning will help you to curb your need for eating all the time feeling for the rest of the day because it is natural sugarMake sure you do not eat for two hours after each meal and when you feel like eating something grab a glass of water . Replace your sugar drinks with water and after dinner you can have a glass of wine or beer as well.I tried every diet in the world and nothing worked and at 53 it worked and I am at 57 healthy and very energetic .",0

"how do you get rid of pregnancy nausea ? Cinnamon tea , an old herbal remedy may help and it does not cost much to try it if you like and can drink cinnamon tea . Steep 2 � tablespoon cinnamon bark or powder in boiling water for ten minutes . Strain , add honey to taste and drink � cup three times a day before meals . You may also buy herbal cinnamon tea bags available at most supermarket.Pregnancy is such an exciting time in life , but for some it is marred by the discomfort of morning sickness or nausea . This is most unpleasant at best and if severe , dehydration can cause multiple problems . None of this is necessary as there is an effective way to relieve the nausea with Myofascial Trigger Point Therapy ( Applied pressure to trigger points in a muscle area ) .Although it has not been proven , the ongoing theory is that hormonal changes trigger spasm in the Pyloric Sphincter ( the muscle surrounding the opening that leaves the stomach ) . Because Myofascial Trigger Point Therapy can relieve muscle spasms of all sorts , it can also relieve the Pyloric Sphincter spasm causing morning sickness , known in the medical field as Hyperemesis Gravidarum . The nausea can start about the 4th week of pregnancy up until the 12th week and for some into the 2nd trimester.However , I have discovered an easy method to eliminate morning sickness . During this stage , the trigger points in the Pyloric Sphincter area are very tender , usually painful and just too uncomfortable to put pressure on one self ; therefore you will need a friend or your husband to help you . You may feel nauseated right afterwards but do not feel discouraged there will be relief a bit later . You may need to repeat this every 3 hours if the nausea returns . If the trigger points are too tender to repeat every 3 hours , repeat every 6 hours . This way you can at least get some food and fluids down to maintain good nutrition.If the nausea is severe , try eating only food , ( omitting liquids ) at meal times and take your fluids between meals . Milk just brought to the boil and then refrigerated is quite pleasant and a good food source.Let me explain why it works and how I discovered it . I am a Registered Nurse and have worked many years in the anti-partum unit at a good size hospital in Orange County . This unit treats patients with difficult pregnancies . One of the common problems is dehydration due to severe nausea called Hyperemesis Gravidarum . Most doctors prescribe intravenous fluids and medication for nausea . This does not always work and the nausea and vomiting often continues which puts the patient in a starvation situation forcing the treating doctor to order Hyper alimentation fluid . A complete nutritional fluid given intravenously that costs approximately $ 500 a bag and is given over a twenty-four hour period . The patient is still nauseated and vomiting but is fed nutritionally and may need this feeding for 2 to 3 weeks and sometimes more.Now I found that if I used an easy method of helping the pregnant mom and taught her husband how to help his wife , when she was first admitted and given some intravenous fluid she would go home in a day or two . However if I was not on duty and and the patient had been started on the Hyper alimentation fluid , my method did not seem effective . The patient would still suffer nausea although she would receive adequate nutrition.So if you are pregnant , fear nausea and want to make sure you feel good all the time and not have to go through all this hospital suffering , you may want to print this health tip . Have your husband help with the procedure even before you experience nausea , just as a preventative measure.NOTE : This procedure may also bring some very quick relief from gastric problems when they are caused by spasm of the Pyloric Sphincter.FOLLOW THIS EASY METHOD : Xiphoid Process.gif ( 7811 bytes ) 1 ) Have the mother lie flat on her back with her helper to one side.2 ) Start two inches below the Xiphoid Process which is the bottom tip of the S",0

"How far will the Cincinnati Bengals go this football season ? This really all depends on how well the Cincinnati Bengals handle the pressure of the playoffs and how well the defense plays . Cincinnati Bengals rank 11th in total rushing yards , 6th in total passing yards and 4th in total Offense yards . Making them among the best offensive teams in the NFL today and the team is still young and learning how to work with each other.On the other hand the defense has been a nightmare . Only good thing going for the defense is the fumbles recovered and interceptions they have made this year , which plays a big role in why they are where they are now . The defense has allowed a total 1522 rushing yards , allowed 2735 passing yards and are ranked 24th in the NFL overall in yards allowed.In order to get to the SuperBowl the defense must step up and make the big plays , there is no room for error in the playoffs . I think they can get the 2nd seed in the AFC , with games left with only one team that has a winning record and good team . The other two games are against the coachless Lions and the Bills who are both no where near the playoffs . I like the Cincinnati Bengals chances of going to the SuperBowl and winning it , just do n't bet on it , unless the defense comes to play .",0

"why was Thomas More beheaded ? More refused to attend the coronation of Anne Boleyn as the Queen of England . Shortly thereafter More was charged with accepting bribes , but the patently false charges had to be dismissed for lack of any evidence . In 1534 he was accused of conspiring with Elizabeth Barton , a nun who had prophesized against the king 's divorce , but More was able to produce a letter in which he had instructed Barton not to interfere with state matters.On April 13 of that year More was asked to appear before a commission and swear his allegiance to the parliamentary Act of Succession . More accepted Parliament 's right to declare Anne the legitimate queen of England , but he refused to take the oath because an anti-papal preface to the Act made of it an acknowledgement of Parliament 's authority to legislate in matters of religion by denying the authority of the Pope , which More would not accept . Four days later he was imprisoned in the Tower of London , where he wrote his devotional Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation.On July 1 , 1535 , More was tried before a panel of judges that included the new Lord Chancellor , Sir Thomas Audley , as well as Anne Boleyn 's father , brother , and uncle . He was charged with high treason for denying the validity of the Act of Succession . More believed he could not be convicted as long as he did not explicitly deny that the king was the head of the church , and he therefore refused to answer all questions regarding his opinions on the subject . Thomas Cromwell , at the time the most powerful of the king 's advisors , brought forth the Solicitor General , Richard Rich , to testify that More had , in his presence , denied that the king was the legitimate head of the church . This testimony was almost certainly perjured ( witnesses Richard Southwell and Mr Palmer both denied having heard the details of the reported conversation ) , but on the strength of it the jury voted for More 's conviction",0

"what etiquette , respect and rules does one need to follow as a tourist in Dubai , united Arab Emirates ? Hi - I 've only been to the airport in Duabi , but here are some pointers I found : DressAlthough the UAE is very liberal in many respects , the correct dress code is important in order not to cause offence . Conservative clothes that cover the body and limbs are preferable to casual shorts and sleeveless tops for both sexes , especially in rural areas where tradition is important.Indeed , long , loose clothing can be much cooler and more comfortable than smaller items that expose the skin to the hot sun.The Arab national dress worn in Dubai is made especially to keep the wearer cool during the hottest of weather . Men wear the kandoura or dishdasha , a white , ankle-length garment which is a loose fit and very effective in the hot and cold.Women wear an abayah , which is a black , long-sleeved , full-length robe . Both men and women wear head coverings to protect their heads and faces from the sun and windblown sand.Traditional garments are also ideal for when the temperature drops sharply at night.PhotographyNormal tourist photography is acceptable , but it is considered offensive to photograph Muslim women . It is also courteous to request permission before photographing men . Always avoid taking photographs of anything even remotely military , such as buildings , perimeter fences , vehicle convoys , checkpoints , airports and so on.TippingTipping practices are similar to most parts of the world . Where no service charge is included , 10 % is adequate.BargainingBargaining is an expected part of buying in the souk and elsewhere . Traders will usually drop their prices , often quite substantially , particularly for cash sales , but it is important to be polite at all times and not feign anger or disgust.RamadanDuring this month of fasting , pious Muslims will not eat anything during daylight hours , with most conforming to the injunctions . Foreigners are not expected to follow suit , but it is considered impolite to smoke , drink or eat in public during Ramadan . In general , I 've heard that it 's a fantastic place to go for so many reasons ! I 'm envious - have a great time .",0
"Why is it that RICH Americans walk free from a trial but POOR ones go to jail or to Death Row ? Actually , the percentage of celebraties that walk is about the same as the percentage of 'poor ' people who walk . Conviction rates at trial used to be over 90 % , the rates have been falling and in some major metropolitan areas are down in the 65 % - 70 % range . The big differences are ( 1 ) the big celeb trials make the papers and ( 2 ) 80 to 90 % of the 'poor ' plea guilty to something and do not go to trial.The two big celeb trials , OJ and Blakely are especially unique in that the juries were stupid , stupid , stupid . And in the OJ case , at least , the DAs were incredibly inept . Of course , it was not the jurors fault that they were stupid . They were picked because each one claimed to have no opinion , which meant they had no connection to current events . In the OJ case they also had to be locked up in a hotel for the duration , which meant that the jurors had either no jobs or dead end jobs and no family or social life . Further , with the massive publicity and cameras all around , the jurors got the idea that they were really in a TV show , such as Law & Order or CSI , where the obvious suspect is never the real criminal and all loose ends are tied up before the credits roll . A real trial , like real life ends up with loose ends , and 99 % of the time the obvious suspect did do it .",0

"what do you know about Saudi Arabia ? Sau·di A·ra·bi·a ( sou'dē ə-rā'bē-ə , sô'dē , sä-ū'dē ) A country occupying most of the Arabian Peninsula . Inhabited since ancient times by nomadic Semitic tribes , the region was consolidated under Muhammed , who established a theocratic state at Medina and gained control of all Arabia by 630 . After the caliphate was moved from Medina to Damascus in 661 , the peninsula remained fragmented until most of it was united in the 18th century under the Saud family , who adopted the Wahhabi form of Islam . Crushed by Egyptian and Ottoman opposition in the 19th century , Saudi forces reconquered the peninsula in the early 20th century . The unified kingdom of Saudi Arabia was created in 1932 as an absolute monarchy under Wahhabi law . Oil was discovered in 1932 and soon became the mainstay of the economy . Riyadh is the capital and the largest city . Population : 25,700,000 .",0

"important events during george washingtons presidency ? Key Event : America Signs Treaty with Tripoli.Some more Key Events in President George Washington 's Administration• Precedents -- -Washington established two main precedents : a cabinet and the two-year term.• Whiskey Rebellion , 1794 -- -Washington ordered 15,000 troops to Pennsylvania and crushed the first challenge to federal authority.• Farewell Address , 1796 -- -Washington warned against the evils of political parties and `` tangling alliances '' abroad . On April 30 , 1789 , George Washington , standing on the balcony of Federal Hall on Wall Street in New York , took his oath of office as the first President of the United States . `` As the first of every thing , in our situation will serve to establish a Precedent , '' he wrote James Madison , `` it is devoutly wished on my part , that these precedents may be fixed on true principles . '' Born in 1732 into a Virginia planter family , he learned the morals , manners , and body of knowledge requisite for an 18th century Virginia gentleman . He pursued two intertwined interests : military arts and western expansion . At 16 he helped survey Shenandoah lands for Thomas , Lord Fairfax . Commissioned a lieutenant colonel in 1754 , he fought the first skirmishes of what grew into the French and Indian War . The next year , as an aide to Gen. Edward Braddock , he escaped injury although four bullets ripped his coat and two horses were shot from under him . From 1759 to the outbreak of the American Revolution , Washington managed his lands around Mount Vernon and served in the Virginia House of Burgesses . Married to a widow , Martha Dandridge Custis , he devoted himself to a busy and happy life . But like his fellow planters , Washington felt himself exploited by British merchants and hampered by British regulations . As the quarrel with the mother country grew acute , he moderately but firmly voiced his resistance to the restrictions . When the Second Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia in May 1775 , Washington , one of the Virginia delegates , was elected Commander in Chief of the Continental Army . On July 3 , 1775 , at Cambridge , Massachusetts , he took command of his ill-trained troops and embarked upon a war that was to last six grueling years . He realized early that the best strategy was to harass the British . He reported to Congress , `` we should on all Occasions avoid a general Action , or put anything to the Risque , unless compelled by a necessity , into which we ought never to be drawn . '' Ensuing battles saw him fall back slowly , then strike unexpectedly . Finally in 1781 with the aid of French allies -- he forced the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown . Washington longed to retire to his fields at Mount Vernon . But he soon realized that the Nation under its Articles of Confederation was not functioning well , so he became a prime mover in the steps leading to the Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia in 1787 . When the new Constitution was ratified , the Electoral College unanimously elected Washington President He did not infringe upon the policy making powers that he felt the Constitution gave Congress . But the determination of foreign policy became preponderantly a Presidential concern . When the French Revolution led to a major war between France and England , Washington refused to accept entirely the recommendations of either his Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson , who was pro-French , or his Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton , who was pro-British . Rather , he insisted upon a neutral course until the United States could grow stronger . To his disappointment , two parties were developing by the end of his first term . Wearied of politics , feeling old , he retired at the end of his second . In his Farewell Address , he urged his countrymen to forswear excessive party spirit and geographical distinctions . In foreign affairs , he warned against long-term alliances . Washington enjoyed less than three years of retir",0

"What will I have to pay in taxes on an annuity when I withdraw money at age 62 ? Annuities are investments . The portion of your withdrawal that represents your initial investment is withdrawn tax-free . All the earnings on your investment are taxed as ordinary income . This is summarized in IRS Tax Topic 410 ( first link below ) , and more fully detailed in IRS Publication 575 ( second link below ) .There 's no such thing as one-third is tax free , as another answer suggested.To give an over-simplified example : let 's say you invested $ 100,000 into an annuity . And now the annuity is worth $ 500,000 . The original $ 100,000 is returned to you tax-free , and the remaining $ 400,000 is taxable income . Annuities are designed to provide you income for life , and so you will be spreading your tax-free withdrawals over the entire period of your withdrawals.Spending an hour or so with a CPA should help you plan your retirement so that you minimize your taxes.All the best , William Pereztaxes.about.com",0

"whats the verdict ? If I have tablet w/ voice output and I wrote something falsely accusing a person behind a sheet of cloth , the person heard my false accusation via voice generation . How would he/she sue me , slander or libel ? What Are Defamation , Libel and Slander ? Generally speaking , defamation is the issuance of a false statement about another person , which causes that person to suffer harm . Slander involves the making of defamatory statements by a transitory ( non-fixed ) representation , usually an oral ( spoken ) representation . Libel involves the making of defamatory statements in a printed or fixed medium , such as a magazine or newspaper . Typically , the elements of a cause of action for defamation include : A false and defamatory statement concerning another ; The unprivileged publication of the statement to a third party ( that is , somebody other than the person defamed by the statement ) ; If the defamatory matter is of public concern , fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher ; and Damage to the plaintiff . In the context of defamation law , a statement is `` published '' when it is made to the third party . That term does not mean that the statement has to be in print . Damages are typically to the reputation of the plaintiff , but depending upon the laws of the jurisdiction it may be enough to establish mental anguish . Most jurisdictions also recognize `` per se '' defamation , where the allegations are presumed to cause damage to the plaintiff . Typically , the following may consititute defamation per se : Attacks on a person 's professional character or standing ; Allegations that an unmarried person is unchaste ; Allegations that a person is infected with a sexually transmitted disease ; Allegations that the person has committed a crime of moral turpitude ; While actions for defamation have their roots in common law , most jurisdictions have now enacted statutes which modify the common law . They may change the elements of the cause of action , limit when an action may be filed , or modify the defenses to an action for defamation . Some may even require that the defendant be given an opportunity to apologize before the plaintiff can seek non-economic damages .",0
"What can be done to prevent early ejaculation ? Natural Ejaculation Control Technique is a process where breathing techniques are combined with meditative efforts to stop premature ejaculation . How to practice : [ 1 ] Relax and control your breathing - inhaling and exhaling normally . Keep your eyes loosely closed . Put your tongue against the palate . Focus your mind between your eyebrows at the center of your forehead . [ 2 ] Inhale through your nose deeply at intervals of 2-5 seconds until you can feel your abdomen expand , maximizing the capacity of your lungs . Now , focus your mind to the center of your body , directly towards your navel . [ 3 ] Hold your breath and move your expanded abdomen downward by contracting your upper abdomen . As pressure gradually builds up against the bladder and the prostate gland , shift your mental focus to the prostate area . * Step 3 is the most important step during intercourse – it requires that you hold your breath for as long as possible while applying pressure to the bladder and prostate area . This will partially block sensitivity to the penis , allowing you to last longer and control ejaculation . [ 4 ] Contract your anus by clenching . Then exhale air slowly out of the mouth , shifting concentration once again towards the center of your forehead . * You should feel hot energy rising from the prostate area along the spinal cord to your head.Repeat this cycle several times . But remember , when using the anal clenching method during intercourse , your inhalations and contractions of the abdomen should coincide with your sexual thrusting motions.Although , this might seem difficult at first , with just a little practice ( alone or with a partner ) , you ’ ll soon master it .",0

"Explanation for correlated wave function collapse at a distance ( Quantum Mechanics ) ? I remember from physics class in college that two correlated wavefunctions ( e.g. , sum of wavefunction spins = 0 ) can exhibit strange behavior at a distance . left alone ( e.g. , without measurement of wavefunctions ) , each wavefunction ( called A & B ) has a probability of 50 % spin up and 50 % spin down . WavefunctionA ( WF_A ) is IN NEITHER state until it is ACTUALLY measured . the moment WF_A it is measured , WF_B assumes the opposite spin with DEFINITE probability . i understand that no information is transferred at a distance between WF_A and WF_B , but HOW does this happen . WHAT is the mechanism that collapes WF_B into a definite spin state at a distance ? I am not looking for explanations like `` satisfies laws of conservation '' ... instead i am looking for physical mechanism that allow this seemingly incredible phenomena to work . If the `` weirdness '' i am describing is an artifact of the way i am asking the question ( which is what i suspect ) , explainations there would be appreciated as well . An equally valid question would be `` what is the mechanism that causes WF_A to collapse when it is measured ? '' The schroedinger equation does not predict collapse as a result of any interaction , so it is outside the theory taught in undergraduate classes . There is no accepted theory ( or in my opinion , any reasonable theory at all ) as to why measurement causes a selection of a single eigenvalue out some non-eigenstate . The idea that measurement on one object has ramifications on another object seems more mysterious , but it 's not fundamentally different than the idea that measurement causes collapse in the first place . You wo n't find a satisfying answer .",0
"Is there anything one can do to `` spice '' up what appears to be a dull relationship ( marriage ) ? We love each other , but , I do n't know ... it seems to have lost that magic after 14 years .

This will sound corny , but give it a shot : First , if you 've got kids , send them to the grandparents for the night in advance without him knowing ( say on a Friday ) . Next , turn off all the lights in the house and place scented candles in the bedroom and run a hot bubble bath just before he normally arives home . Have some wine and two wine glasses at the ready on the coffee table , and rose petals on the floor leading a trail to the bedroom -- or whereever you 're most memorable encounter that you can remember occurred . Personally , I like David Sanborn or some other smooth jazz playing in the background . Music is important to setting the mood , and if you 've got cable or a dish , you can tune it to the music of your choice . Just before he gets home , slip into a nice satin & lace nightie and cover it with a heavy robe . When he gets to the door , be there waiting to flash him and let him know what you 've got in store for the evening . Not in a crude way , mind you . Most importantly , take your time ... do n't rush . The anticipation of that which is to come will be as intense as the act itself . Hope that helps ! Peace , JayZ",0

"Are Space and Time continuous or are them quantized ? There are two major theories of modern physics : Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity . Both work well , with QM being applicable to atomic and smaller sizes , and GR to large ( Solar size , galaxy size , etc . ) things.The major question in physics today is : how do we combine QM and GR so that they are two aspects of one larger theory . This postulated theory is usually called a Unified Theory or Theory of Everything or something like that . String theories are attempts to do this ( so far all are still incomplete ) .The major difference between QM and GR is that nn QM energy comes in discrete levels ( all way to small for us to notice ) . However in GR space-time is continious . So it is not instantly clear whether space-time is continous or quantized in a unified theory.For consistency between these space quantization would have to be on extremely small scales . This would almost certain occur ( if it did ) at distances called the Planck length , which is ~ 10^-33 cm . ( This is about one billion trillion times smaller than an atomic nucleus . ) Quantization of time would then be the interval for light to cross this distance , about 10^-43 seconds . It is because of a lack of a unified theory that physicists ca n't say anything about the conditions of the universe before 10^-43 seconds after the Big Bang . ( Of course that is still pretty good . ) The short answer is : no one knows , but the scale of quantization would have to be much , much smaller than any known elementary particle .",0
"Why is the color in a 50 year old movie so much better than in a new movie ? `` better '' is a very subjective term . Technicolor process films allowed for super-saturated colors to be seen in the final print . Currently there is n't any process similar to that in wide use . Technicolor used three strips of black and white film , each exposed through a filter ( red , green , blue ) to capture the original images . Then in a lab , each of the black and white strips were exposed against color film print stock with the same color filter . This process also led to occasional color mis-registration in some films where the lab work was rushed or done sloppily.Most modern films are shot on single-strips of negative with three dye layers of emulsion that are each sensitive to different color wavelengths . ( see the first link below ) A very popular film stock these days is Kodak 's 5279 `` vision 500T '' which has a very high ISO yet does n't get as grainy as previous high ISO films . ( see second link below ) Because films nowadays are shot on single-strip film , super-saturating colors requires post-processing for color-timing , such as digital intermediate processing ( see link 3 below for Discreet 's DI product info . ) Directors also like to have a lot of creative control over the look and feel of a film that is done through the color timing process ( see the 4th link , although the entry is incorrect as Pleasantville was the first film to be completely digitally color-graded in 1998 ) This can include adding hues or increasing or reducing contrast - good examples are in Cinderella Man and Lord of the Rings : ROTK",0

Everyone I have talked to says its a womans right to have the kids but I disagree ! I know how I feel about my girls , just because I am a man does not mean I cant take care of my kids just as well as their mother.Any advice would be greatly appreciated roaddog7072 @ yahoo.com I do n't know where you live but I live in Ontario Canada and I had custody of my children . The reason being that I requested the court to appoint the children their own lawyer , it did and because our chidren have rights here they choose to be with me . The childrens female lawyer and my female lawyer fought my ex 's femail lawyer and what it all boiled down to was the childrens right to be with the parent they wanted to be with . If a child has the capability of choosing then the courts will or at least should listen to them . I did have a male lawyer but because my ex wife had a female lawyer my lawyer recomended that I have a female lawyer fight for me and for the kids . I won custody and my ex had to pay me support for the raising of the children . More and more fathers are getting custody now cause here there finding out that the mothers do not stay at home with the children as much as they first thought . Aparently the fathers do stay home and do spend more time with their children when they have custody . Do n't give up your fight and good luck",0

"compare and contrast kant and machiavelli ? Hmm , does someone have a politcal theory midterm coming up ? Kant was largely a predecessor to Marx/Engels and was critisizing the same social structures they work and their inevitable ends of ruin . Machiavelli on the other hand was an advocate of the totalitarian ideal . Force makes right , but the quite `` The ends justifies the means . `` , in itself is not correct . Even Niccolo would not entirely agree with that . Their deep philophies are much to deep to get into because they were largely addressing different periods in political history . Machiavelli was witnessing Roman decline and revolution , while Kant was witnessing the rise of the industrial revolution and its impacts upon the masses .

"Why is there such a limited choice of realistic US pres . Candidates & how to fix that ? or can we ? The vote is wasted on 3rd party candidates and the rest are slim to say the least . I heard more people complain about the choices this past election than every . Our political system actually filters out decent , ethical and talented candidates . We have elections , but no democracy in the USA ( elected officials generally represent lobbyists and crony friends ) . A possible solution is to employ the jury system ( random selection of representatives ) to fill our legislatures and have them select the President . Realistically , of course , nothing like this will happen so we remain destined to suffer from Presidents who are so beholden to a few that no real leadership can emerge . Yours is a great question , however , and the more folks ask it the more likely some changes will result .",0

"Why is an abortion so easy to get ? Although I think abortion should remain legal , I think it should be harder to get one . All you need is $ 500 . Some girls use it as their only form of birth control . There are many states in which a girl under 18 does n't even have to have her parents permission . [ You ca n't even get your EARS peirced without parental consent . ] Maybe there should be mandatory counseling before and after . Before to go throught he options in handling an unwanted pregnancy ( adoption and so forth ) . And then after to deal with emotional effects of the abortion . What do you think ? if it was hard , women and girls would go to underground clinics , secret places or somewhere where they can get one . its the law of supply and demand . plus the medical consequenses of a backroom abortion could be devastating . at least clinical is safe . who knows what could happen in an uncertified environment . also , clinical provides JOBS , AND THEY MAKE A TON OF MONEY . just like cigarettes or alcohol , if they know they can kill you why is it legal , simple -- MONEY AND JOBS . lobbyists for these groups donate to politicians to get legislation in their favor . money talks . if abortion was illegal all the clinics , doctors , nurses , support staff would be unemployed and have to find another job , not good for the economy . thats why they do n't shut down big business , tobacco farmers would be devastated and the grain farmers , distillers , and distributors would have no job . it all about money , politics and keeping your job and the government getting the TAX DOLLARS generated from these enterprises . its sad but thats the system governments use to generate revenue",0

"gay marriage ? Earlier today I read answers to a question that went something like `` if you had only a month to live what would you do ? '' One of the responses was from a gay man who referred to ( among other things ) making sure his accounts etc . were set up so that his `` husband '' had financial security after his death . It is obvious that , although he loves his partner dearly and considers him his husband , he does not enjoy the same rights and privileges that heterosexual married couples take for granted.I would like to hear from gay couples detailing the disadvantages they face due to not being allowed a legal marriage . ( personal experiences only , please - I can do a google search and find the HRC website on my own ) When I got sick and my husband took me to the emergency room , I had to state that I wanted him to go with me because he is not 'family ' and we are not married . I had to state over and over that I wanted him in the room each time a nurse would enter and have something they needed to do . We found out when getting car insurance for both of our cars that if we were married we would get a discount , but because we are not and because our State does not recognize our union , we could not receive those discounts.At work when filing out my medical insurance information ... part of the benefits of my job ... I was not allowed to list my husband as a beneficiary because the term 'spouse ' is defined as being someone of the opposite gender whom you are married to . Had we any children I was informed that I might not have been able to include them either since the State I reside in only allows for one person in a same-sex union to adopt , the other person is n't allowed to adopt that child . When listing whom I wanted as the beneficiary of the life insurance , I could not list my husband with the same benefits a married couple would receive . He would receive much less if I died than he would have if he had been married to a woman . That was upsetting.My husband is Native American . In his tribe while they do not have any laws stating that same-sex marriage is illegal , when he inquired he was told that it is against traditions and that there is no way two people of the same-sex could be recognized in the tribe as a married couple . When asked about adopting children , he was told that adopted children are not considered a part of the tribe and can not participate in tribal activities . When asked if he had a child , surogate , with a woman that was biologically his and adopted by me if the child could still participate in tribal activities he was told that the child could not because it did not reside in a heterosexual married union ... and that also because I am not part of the tribe.We have talked with lawyers about all the legal things we can do . It would all costs far more money than we have , would require a great deal of court time , and even then there is no guarantee that the courts would honor our requests nor is their a guarantee that the legal documents would be honored by our families ( who could dispute them ) . Perhaps the one thing that bothers me most is n't so much all the legal aspects , it 's that people do n't take seriously our commitment and love for each other . When amongst other people when we refer to each other as husbands there are many people who are quick to remind us that we are n't really husbands ( from heteros and homos both ) . It is n't unusual for people to say things about our relationship that they 'd never say to or about a married couple . There is a big disrespect towards us done each time others invalidate and belittle our commitment , our relationship , and our love for each other . That hurts a lot more than the legal issues , but it often underlies the very problems of why such legal issues are n't resolved.And for the record , we are in our mid-twenties , so while many people seem to think that only 'old ' gay people are dealing with these issues ... They 're not .",0

"what causes hiccups ? Hiccups are gulping sounds caused by involuntary spasms of the diaphragm . The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen and helps with breathing . Hiccups can be triggered if you eat too much or too fast , consume very hot or cold foods and beverages , or drink carbonated beverages . Other causes include cold showers , entering or leaving a hot or cold room , sudden excitement , and stress . Hiccups are not a serious medical condition and usually disappear on their own within a few minutes . If they last longer than 24 hours , hiccups may be a sign of another condition or injury . You should see your health care provider if you experience prolonged hiccuping . Home remedies are usually the primary treatment for hiccups , although no one is really sure how well they work . Hiccup home remedies include sneezing , being suddenly frightened , holding your breath , gargling , drinking pineapple juice , drinking water rapidly , sipping ice water , or swallowing dry granulated sugar . These activities may help by altering breathing patterns .",0

"Getting started as a Financial Analyst ? I have a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and have over 5 years of experience in the field . Unfortunately I 've decided that it 's not my cup of tea and I have recently looked into switching careers.I 've always been an analytical and thorough person so I feel a career as a financial analyst in a corporate setting ( as opposed to an investment bank ) would suit me well . I 've already taken about 6 accounting classes and have gotten A 's in all of my classes . The only problem is , I do n't know where to get started . What 's the best way into the position ? My options at the moment are : * Get an Associates Degree in Accounting* Get a second Bachelors Degree in Accounting/Finance* Get a Masters Degree in Accounting* Take the CPA exam w/o the required work experienceOut of all of these options , what 's the best choice in getting hired ? I believe your best option is to obtain your bachelors degree in accounting/finance . Inherently , this is a more attractive degree due to the amount of education obtained . Furthermore , any respectable company will require a bachelors degree for a financial analyst position.While the other two options are not bad , they will not help you greatly so I would do them only if it is in addition to the second bachelors degree . Passing the CPA exam without the work experience will not obtain you your certification , which is the true `` resume value '' so you would have only passed a test and would have an interest dinner conversation piece at best.The masters degree in accounting is also nice as a supplement to your bachelors degree , but entirely unnecessary . Most firms/corporations you talk with are not interested in a graduate degree unless it is specifically applicable to the position , which for a financial analyst position it is not . Those are just my thoughts.. : - )",0

"Do illegal aliens inflict short-term or long-term damage on the US economy ? Humanitarian issues aside , what is the real danger in letting illegals flood across our borders ?

This can make some social services unavailable for citizens because of the strain it puts on the system.Some people argue that they steal valuable american jobs , but most of them are day laborers or farmworkers because they do n't have the paperwork to get a decent job . SOME americans do need these jobs ... but a lot of unemployed people are not looking for that kind of work.It is also hard to control a bunch of people that do n't know our language well ( some speak great ) , have different cultural values , and are not familiar with our laws.If they are caught and deported , it would seem like a short term problem , but there are always more coming , with no end in sight , so the problem itself is long term , even if the people are n't .",0

"When is the best time to go to disney world ? This is my response to a similar question : This depends on what you are looking for as far as the best time . Christmas time is one of the most beautiful times of the year . Each resort is decorated for Christmas and the decorations are beautiful . If you go during this time you have to visit the resorts . They have a carousel made out of chocolate , a a very large gingerbread house and other amazing things . Plus , the christmas trees are beautiful as well . Also , the whether is nicer . Usually it will run in the low 70s during the day . If you are near the water it is a little cold and windy , but not too bad . Also , the parades in the park are themed for Christmas and very nice to see . However , if you have never been to Disney , you may want to see the regular parades . The crowds can be bad , but I have gone several times during Christmas and it is a great time of the year to go . I highly recommend staying away from the time around July 4 . During this time almost all of the parks will close due to capacity . So lines are extremely long and it is terrible to try to get around . Also , it is very hard . Combine the large crowds and the heat and it can be misserable . You will not have as much fun if it is this hot and crowded as you would otherwise . however , the fireworks during this time are spectacular and will not dissapoint . But you have to wait a long time in order to see them from a good location.I usually prefer going after school has started . September/October is a great time . The weather is nice , crowds are n't and big as the other times of the year . If you go in value season you can save yourself some money . Keep in mind , Disney will often do refurbishments during this time because it is not as busy , so some attractions may be closed while you are there . But it easy to find this out ahead of time . Also , if you go in October you can go to Mickey 's not so scary halloween . This is a must see if you go during this time . The park is closed early that day and you have to have another ticket to get in . But there is a fraction of the people in the park . There are rides open and you basically walk right on . It is nice to be there when it is n't as busy and it is really neat as well . Plus , if you have kids , it is more kid friendly than the Universal Halloween party.So you need to think about what you prefer and then take your vacation at that time of year .",0

"As earth gains weight , will it affect its rotation on its axis and its revolution around the sun ? Will the contniuous weight gain of earth affect the orbits of other planets and our solar system as well as the entire universe ? If the mass of the earth changes , then if we could `` weigh '' it on a scale , its weight would change . Changing the mass of the earth definitely affects its rotation rate , and its orbit , as well as all the other orbits of bodies in the solar system , including the sun , and of course , bodies outside the solar system . All of the laws of motion and gravity that the earth and the other bodies obey depend on the mass of the earth.How might mass of the earth change ? 1 . The earth is gaining mass every year from meteorites of course . The amount of material falling to earth is estimated to be between 37,000 and 78,000 tons per year ( see first reference ) .I am not sure if this includes material from the solar wind , or from the tails of comets , or from cosmic dust ( see below ) which are also sources of material from space that the earth gathers , but I believe it does . 2 . The earth is also losing material because we are now launching satellites and sending space vehicles off on missions . 3 . At the boundary of the atmosphere and space ( the exosphere ) where air can escape into space . The amount of air that is lost depends on how fast the ions , atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere are moving . I have including a web page that discusses this below . 4 . When radioactive material decays , it can emit electromagnetic radiation ( gamma rays ) that carry off a tiny amount of mass . Some of these gamma rays might make it all the way out of earth 's atmosphere , but very few I would imagine . I am not sure how to estimate this . It would definitely have to be balanced against the flood of radiation that the earth is being bathed in by the sun and by cosmic rays . Without doing any calculations , I would guess that the earth is probably experiencing a net gain of mass every year , and this increases the force of gravity between it and all the other celestial bodies . It also will make it spin more slowly , as the moment of inertia of the earth changes . However , the gain is very small . From the figures above , the earth 's mass increases by roughly 10^ ( -15 ) per cent per year ; that is , the earth experiences a gain of about 0.000000000000001 % per year .",0

"What are the odds of a man catching HIV while having unprotected sex ( oral and vaginally ) ? What are the odds of a man catching HIV while having unprotected sex ( oral and vaginally ) with a woman who is HIV positive or AIDS . How do those odds change over time ? In other words , one sexual encounter versus multiple ? The following numbers are old , and they 're all pretty much guesswork anyway , so take them with a grain of salt . But I venture to say most people in the field would agree with my conclusions.According to a report by researchers Norman Hearst and Stephen Hulley in the Journal of the American Medical Association , the odds of a heterosexual becoming infected with AIDS after one episode of penile-vaginal intercourse with someone in a non-high-risk group without a condom are one in 5 million . With a condom it 's even safer -- one in 50 million . Just to put this in perspective , the chances of someone in your family getting injured next year in a bubble bath are 1 in 1.3 million ( source : The Odds on Virtually Everything , Heron House , 1980 ) . You 're in much greater danger of being struck by lightning ( 1 in 600,000 ) , having your house bombed ( 1 in 290,000 ) , or being murdered ( 1 in 11,000 ) .The numbers get a lot worse if you engage in `` high-risk behavior '' -- having sexual intercourse or sharing needles with a member of a high-risk group , e.g. , a gay or bisexual male or IV drug user from a major metro area , or a hemophiliac . The chances of getting AIDS from one such encounter range as high as 1 in 10,000 using a condom to 1 in 1,000 unprotected . Even if your partner tests negative for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , the chances of infection from a high-risk person are still relatively high -- 1 in 50,000 without a condom . That 's because there 's a 45 to 90 day window during which a newly infected person can infect others but test negative . ( A few people go as long as 180 days . ) From there on out , statistically speaking , things deteriorate pretty fast . If your partner is HIV-positive , your chances of getting AIDS after one night are 1 in 5,000 with a condom , 1 in 500 without . Have sex with an HIV-positive partner 500 times using condoms and your chances escalate to 1 in 11 . Skip the gift wrap and they 're 2 in 3.A couple points : These odds apply equally to men and women . Although there 's reason to believe male-to-female AIDS transmission happens more often than female-to-male , the amount of difference is unknown . Also , I have to emphasize again , the numbers involve a lot of guesswork . The authors admit they could be off by a factor of ten in either direction . Still , one message comes through loud and clear : by far the best thing you can do to avoid AIDS is to be picky about your partners . Use of condoms reduces your risk by a factor of 10 , sleeping only with people who test negative reduces it by a factor of 5 to 50 , but avoiding high-risk partners reduces it by a factor of 5,000 . ( You 'd also be well advised to avoid high-risk behavior , such as unprotected receptive anal sex . ) Asking for a resume may not be romantic , but it beats Kaposi 's sarcoma .",0

"As a Christian , how do you find balance between ... . ( see the details ) ? In my life , God has put a large number of persons in my life from a vast array of Christian Cults ... some whom I know and love very much . However , I find it very difficult to deal with this group of people . I accept people of separate belief systems without this challenge . Mostly , because Christian cults are preaching something that parallels Christian beliefs , but unfortunately is still wrong . I feel the sense of urgency to debunk what they are saying so as to prevent the young and impressionable ( in the Faith , etc ) from falling in their trap and being lost . Yet , Jesus tells us not to throw the Gospel at these people to be trampled upon . Where is the balance in this ? Anyone found a useful text or exercise on this ? Obviously Prayer and reading the Word come first ! Any particular scriptures you find helpful ? Anyone else had to deal much with these troubles ? I would love to hear from Schneb on this if anyone has him on speed dial . : -p People mean well ( though they do harm ) when they approach potential converts to Christianity by , abrasively , reminding them of their sinful standard of living.In the beginning of witnessing such 'ministering , ' my reaction was vexation of spirit because Jesus was never harsh with hurting people . The woman caught in adultery was not condemned by Jesus.When people surrounded her to carry out the brutal punishment of death by stoning , I can only imagine the fear of having a crowd of people on a mission to kill me for bad judgment ... for a bad call ... for a bad ( correctable ) choice . I can also imagine her relief to hear the noise of the crowd diminish as they listened to a lone , quiet voice of hope ( gently calling attention to their times of bad judgment ) and how they escaped punishment.True believers have to be that lone voice of hope , ( that balance ) to potential new converts subjected to the noise of those who do not minister in meekness . Paul stated in I Timothy 2:24 `` And the servant of the Lord must not strive ; but be gentle unto all men , apt to teach , patient , :25 In meekness instructing those who oppose themselves ; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth ; :26 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil , who are taken captive by him at his will . `` Therefore , as a Christian , when my thoughts lean toward harsh rebuke of those who mean well ( but do harm in their zealous ministry ) , I understand they need more instruction on how to minister in meekness . Lifting them in prayer and supplication to God ( that they become more sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit ) grants me peace from the torment of a vexed spirit .",0

"what happens when you quit a job because of depression ? Can you get it back ? I quit my job as a teacher due to expected bouts of depression . I went to a doctor . I was told by a rep that I had to quit since I was so new . I mean I didnt get formally diagnosed or treated . I didnt want to quit , but I felt it was my only option . I want to be a teacher again in the NYC Teaching Fellows . They said they dont reinstate anyone , however , this was unexpected and it is a illness . With treatment , I can improve . What are the chances that I can plead for my job back ? When you quit a job for any reason , you do n't usually have the option of getting it back just by asking . You will probably have to reapply to the position -- if it 's still available -- and go through the whole interview process again.The only way this situation would have been different due to your depression would be if they had offered short-term disability . I 'm not sure if this was offered , especially since you were new , but this option typically puts your position on hold while you are recovering/going through treatment . However , doing this for mental illnesses is n't always the same as a physical injury/disability , as it 's usually more helpful for a person to keep working and going through a normal routine.Anyway , it seems like you will probably have to reapply to the position . If you were forced to quit though , rather than go on disability , you might have a legal case against them , but this is only a guess .",0

If you want to do this with her , lay out the ground rules in advance , get involved in a local swinger 's group , and realize that if she enjoys sex with somebody else , the odds of her leaving you are much , much higher if you swing because you are allowing her to 'shop around ' , so to speak .

She might also realize how unsatisfied she is by you and your marriage will suffer , especially when the other guy is much more experienced with pleasuring a woman and gives her orgasm after orgasm . Your odds of picking up various STDs will also increase . Remember that a condom will not protect against all of them , such as genital warts , and you could both end up unlucky recipients of STDs that you 'll carry the rest of your lives .

"what impcat of personal computers does it have on correspondence ? Personal computers introduced a more efficient form of asynchronous communication . Synchronous communication is when both parties are talking , communicating at the same time . This is like a chat room , or a telephone conversation . The difficulty that this can cause arises with the different time zones , schedule conflicts , etc.Asychronous communication is when both parties need not be present , thereby eliminating the difficulty of time zones and other scheduling difficulties . Prior to personal computers being used for correspondence , mail was used . Because of the delays between writing a message , a letter , and the recipient getting the letter , this was not very efficient . The telegraph sped up the process a bit , but could be expensive , and did not allow for long and detailed messages . Fax machines helped speed up the process , but , for a long time , you needed specialized and expensive equipment . E-mail introduced a very fast , and inexpensive , means of asynchronous communication , and because personal computers are becoming more and more common , more people are able to use the process .",0

"Ice to Steam ? Calculate the amount of heat ( in kJ ) needed to change 59.90 g ice at -17.87 oC to steam at 250.7 oC . ( Some constants for H2O : Heat of fusion : 333 J/g ; Heat of vaporization : 2260 J/g ; Specific heats : Ice : 2.1 J/g.K , Water : 4.2 J/g.K , Steam : 2.0 J/g.K ) Note : I 'm going to convert all the intermediate steps into kJ by dividing by 1000 . I wo n't show that step . First , let 's find out how much heat it 'll take to get the ice from -17.87 degrees to zero degrees , where it has to be in order to melt . This is a change of 17.87 degrees . ( Because one degree Celsius and one Kelvin is the same size degree , they are interchangable . ) We 'll use the specific heat capacity of ice . 59.90 g ice * ( 2.1 J/g*K ) * ( 17.87 K ) =2248 J = 2.248 kJNext , let 's find out how much energy it would take to melt that ice at 0 degrees to water at 0 degrees using the heat of fusion:59.90 g ice * ( 333 J/g ) =19950 J = 19.95 kJNext , let 's find out how much energy it would take to get the water from 0 to 100 degrees ( so it can become steam ) using the specific heat of water:59.90 g water * ( 4.2 J/g*K ) * ( 100 . K ) =25160 J = 25.16 kJNext , let 's find out how much energy it would take to evaporate the water using the heat of vaporization : 59.90 g water* ( 2260 J/g ) =135400J = 135.4 kJFinally , let 's find out how much energy it would take to get the steam from 100 to 250.7 degrees for a total change of 150.7 ; we will use the specific heat capacity of steam:59.90 g steam* ( 2.0 J/g*K ) * ( 150.7 K ) =18050 J= 18.05 kJ . Now , just add up all of the heats required at each of these steps : 2.248 kJ+19.95 kJ+25.16 kJ+135.4 kJ+18.05 kJ=200.8 kJ , with correct significant figures .",0

"can wood be liquified ? well , it depends on what you mean by `` liquefied '' . most certainly it can be ground or sanded into a fine dust ( sawdust ) and then mixed with water - voila , liquified wood.on the other hand , if you mean melted , the way you melt ice or iron.. not really , no . wood is a pretty complex substance , with lots of different kinds of chemicals arranged into cells . chemically speaking , it 's mostly carbon and water , and trace amounts of a bazillion other chemicals . if you heat it up , some other chemical reactions will happen first ( combustion , for instance , in the presence of oxygen ) . in the absence of oxygen , you make charcoal if you heat wood to around 300C - the water evaporates away , the bonds break and all the other chemicals are driven out . what 's left is a chunk of solid , mostly ( 90 % ) carbon in noncrystalline or `` amorphous '' form . if you KEEP heating it , always without any oxygen because it 'll burn otherwise - eventually this stuff will melt , but solid carbon melts at around 3800C , which is getting pretty close to the temperature of the surface of the sun . so it 's pretty difficult to do , though if you increase the pressure , the melting temperature will go down - this is how they make synthetic diamonds.otherwise , wood can be `` liquefied '' through other chemical processes , such as decomposition/rotting - this is where oil comes from - but by the time it 's liquid , it hardly qualifies as wood anymore.so , i guess the short answer to the question is no , it ca n't be .",0

"How is `` Evolution '' plausible or logical ? Simply because Darwin used well developed ( by humans , but well developed nonetheless ) , well proven , scientific methodolgy instead of relying on the dogmas of a belief system to base his observations on.Keep in mind that , in science , there are very few laws any longer . Everything is a theory because , especially after relativity , scientists discovered that our universe does n't stay consistent as you move into and out of certain states ( like the speed of light ) . However , this does not eliminate the theory as quackery or false . It means that the theory can only be applied in certain circumstances ( it 's relative to certain states ) so it can not be a `` law '' as laws are immutable.That being said , science only has observable evidence as it 's foundation ( or provable evidence through mathematics ) . Darwin observed the various species on the Galapagos islands and drew conclusions as to the nature of their adaptations ( long beaks , short beaks , etc. ) . He also observed that various birds with nearly identical characteristics had slight variations in their adaptations . This caused him to draw other conclusions . In short , he used a scientific process to develop early versions of his theory of evolution . It has been scrutinized since , and the only ones `` disproving '' it have been those who belive religious texts are God 's absolute word.I am a believer in Christ , yet I see no issue with believing there is truth to Darwin 's theories . Did God ultimately create all things ? Of course He did . However , is the Bible absolute in it 's description in the origins of life ? Probably not . Even Christ , according to the biblical record , spoke in stories ( parables ) most of the time so people would understand his message and have examples to work from . He rarely spoke in absolutes , and when he did it was usually only with the apostles.I belive that Genesis is a parable describing God 's creation of all that is , in an understandable way since it is unlikely that we will ever completely understand how He did it . However , even I admit it is only a belief , and may be wrong , like Darwin may be wrong , or literal interpretations of Genesis may be wrong .",0

'' Then you wo n't need to spread the news -- trust me , it will spread itself.After you tell someone , the best thing to do might be to follow up with a `` We 're very happy , but it 's important to both of us that we act professionally in the workplace ! We want to make sure everyone 's still comfortable . '' And then continue to act that way.The reason I say not to make an official announcement is that that is the most surefire way to get everyone gossipping ( even if you do n't think they will ! ) , and looking out for drama . Rather , if you just reveal quietly when asked , it 'll seem like `` no big deal , '' or , people will realize that you 've been acting so professionally , that 's why they 're surprised ! They will be less likely to gossip that way . ( Of course , if it 's your boss or your direct report , or if it 's against company policy , I would advise you seek a different job . )",0
"Can i adddepreciation expense in cashflow even Der is no accumulated depreciation in balnce sheet.will it blan I am having a problem in forecasting a financial statement about adding a depreciation expense in cashflow even though there is no accumulated depreciaiton in the balance sheet under fixed asset it will not balance on the actual amount , on the other hand if I did n't include the depreeciaiton in cashflow the balance sheet will balance . Can you help me on this ? Depreciation is added into every cash flow statement that I have ever seen where a company has fixed depreciable assets . Since it reduces net income but does not currently rely on the use of cash , you add it back . The purchase of the asset would be handled seperately as a use of cash . If you have a depreciation expense you should have an accumulated depreciation amount on your balance sheet . That sounds like your problem.Equipment $ 10,000.00accum depr . 1,000.00net asset $ 9,000.00If your first years depreciation was $ 1,000.00 then that would be on the income statement as an expense and on the cash flow as an add back to cash flow . You would also have an equipment purchase of $ 10,000.00 reducing your cash flow .",0

"is the luxury class basically parasitic in nature ? like i see a lot of wives basking in the reflected glory of their husbands ... aint this simply a parasitic existence ? The class alone is not merely parasitic . If not for the luxury class , who would start businesses ? Not to mention that the service industry feeds off of this class , indeed depends on the luxury of others ( the luxury of being able to afford restaurants , hotels , etc . ) to support them . We live too closely bound on this planet in every way to consider any part of our society parasitic . The institutions of welfare and the like are parasitic in nature , but the people on these services are not parasitic by nature either . They are merely taking advantage of a service which should not be offered in the first place.And I work full time , and live under the poverty line . This is not the elite speaking .

"Why does carbon form so many compounds ? There are lots of reasons why there are large number of organic compounds .I ’ m giving U few of them.Catenation : The tendency of an element to form chains of identical atoms is called catenation . This tendency is observed in the case of non-metals showing covalency of two or more . However , this property is maximum in carbon as it can combine with other carbon atoms by single , double or triple covalent bonds . The bonding can be extended to form long open chain ( straight or branched ) or closed ones . Catenation property depends upon the value of bond energy which is maximum in the case of carbon . Bond : C-C Si-Si S-S P-P N-N O-OBond energy : 83 54 54 50 39 35 ( approximately ) ( kcal/mol ) The stability or the strength of the bond decreases as the bond energy decreases . Hence , the tendency of catenation decreases in the following manner ; C > Si ~ S > P > N > OTendency to combine with other non-metals : Carbon has the ability to form strong covalent bonds with many other atoms such as H , O , S , N , Cl , Br , I , etc . The C-C bond energy is approximately equals to the magnitude of bond energies between carbon and various other atoms.Bond C-C C-H C-O C-Cl C-N C-BrBond energy 83.0 97.0 86.0 81.0 73.0 68.0 ( approximately ) ( kcal/mol ) Isomerism is one of the reason also .",0
"Definitions ? please ! ? Please describe the following and how the 're usedResource-Oil -Natural Gas-Coal-Water-Wood- In the context of your question , A resource is a source of material or energy that may be consumed , changed , or dispersed to the point it is no longer easily usable . Examples would be copper ore , oxygen in the atmosphere , helium gas taken from oil wells , water , sand , or even soil . Anything we do consumes or utilizes some sort of resource . Breathing uses oxygen from the air . Copper is used for wiring and piping . Helium is used for scientific research and birthday balloons . Sand is used to make concrete . Water is used for drinking , irrigation , and generating hydroelectric power . Soil is used for growing crops . None of these are exhaustive lists , just examples . Oil : Oil is a mixture of organic compounds extracted from the earth by drilling . It is created from organic materials deposited in sedimentary rock that are altered by heat , pressure , and biotic processes to create it . Oil is used to make gasoline , diesel , airplane fuel , plastic , shampoo , rubber , antihistamines , and many other products . Natural gas : It is an organic gas that is also extracted from the earth by drilling . It is generated by a similar process to that for oil generation . It is used to heat homes , make fertilizer , and some plastics . Water : Water is found in many forms , but mostly as either fresh or saltwater . Fresh water is used for drinking , irrigation , etc . Saltwater is not as useful directly to man , but is an essential part of our environment as the oceans both support food supplies and have a large effect on the climate . Wood : Wood comes from living organisms- trees . Wood can be used for building many things , including houses . It is used for fuel and is the primary source of fuel in some parts of the world .",0

"Do you think patriotism should be taught in public schools ? Why or Why Not ? I am trying to see how people view this question . Think in terms of freedom of thought . Should we be forced to love this country or should love of country come from the individuals ability to reason ? As a child , I remember reciting the Pledge of Allegiance on a daily basis up to a certain point - exactly what year we stopped escapes me at the moment , however . I do n't have a problem with that - as a United States citizen , I do n't mind the occasional exercise in patriotism.However , before it can be taught in schools ( if ever ) , there needs to be a consensus on how the concept is presented . The last thing I 'd want is some stereotypical militant white supremacist or some disenchanted cynic teaching the course or devising the curriculum.How 's *that* for a somewhat-less-than-concrete answer ? Truthfully , I hate any type of mind control methods , but we have the choice of whether or not to stay here - if we choose to stay , then we should exercise some loyalty and respect for the Constitution and the laws of the land . However , recognizing our freedoms includes speaking up when things are going wrong and need to be changed - being a true patriot means you want the bad things changed and not for anyone to be stuck with the `` America : love it or leave it '' idiocy .",0

"Why does metal spark in the microwave ? The short answer is : Microwaves bombard the metal with radio waves ( electrons ) . Where that energy builds up , it can build to the point the energy will arc to another spot . Works great with crumpled foil , or CD-ROM 's you do n't want to use anymore . Quoth Wikipedia : `` ... the pointed ends of the fork will act to concentrate the electric field formed at the tips . This has the effect of exceeding the dielectric breakdown gradient of air , about 3 megavolts per meter ( 3×106V/m ) , causing sparks to form . This effect is directly analogous to the effect of St. Elmo 's fire. '' P.S . According to Mythbusters , you CAN NOT damage your microwave by putting metal objects in it for short periods of time . You would have to microwave metal a LOT for it to overload the magnetron and cause damage ( most magnetrons in consumer microwaves have overload protection anyway ) . Try microwaving a CD you do n't need anymore upside-down in your microwave for 2-5 seconds , and watch the miracle of radio lithography ( just do n't do it to the point the plastic melts , or who knows what kind of toxic fumes you might release from the plastic ) .",0

Any channel of communication that relys on infrastucture ie : the internet , the telephone has at least 2 disavatages : the infrasturcture can be broken ( the power goes out , the computer is dropped out the window , trees fall on a telephone line ... ect . ) also the security of the message is in doubt ( black hackers , wiretaps , paranoid goverments ... ect . ) Hope some of those helped .",0

"Does the Patriot Act Really Work ? What 's your opinion ? I think it 's a fallacy in the idea that the Patriot Act , or any other law , can actually stop criminals . The Brady bunch of laws has n't stopped a criminal from buying guns . Terrorists will find a workaround , too . The Patriot Act does n't even act as a deterrent . Remember , The 9-11 terrorists only had boxcutters , and I 'll bet they did n't bother to read any laws . The Patriot Act makes suspects out of honest people , and violates the rights of innocent people , the people that laws are supposed to protect . The Patriot Act is a perversion of the law . The President and all the rest of these public servants who act more like they are our rulers took an oath to uphold the Constitution , not disregard it , and not pass whatever laws they want as if the Constitution did not exist . What they do sounds more like treason to me -- or at least a great reason to kick them out of their offices onto their smug asses . Remember : the purpose of the Constitution is to protect you from your government . It probably works to some degree . We 've managed to prevent some terrorist actions as a result of it ... although at the expense of diminishing the authority of the U.S. Constitution.I 'm a believer in slippery slopes so I imagine the logical end to all of this is to preempt every potentially illegal action by putting the entire population of the country into prison ... just to be on the safe side .",0

"There are two Beliefs of Christ in Judism , What are they ? The newest technique used by Christian missionaries and other Christian Clergy , is what they call learning about `` The Jewish Roots of Christianity . '' One might think this means how , in their opinion , Christianity began with Jews , or developed from Judaism . However , this is not what they mean by `` the Jewish Roots . '' The way they show that the roots of Christianity are to be found in Judaism is that they put a Christian theological interpretation into a Jewish ceremony or ritual . Then they claim that this planted Christian theological interpretation , having been `` found '' in something Jewish ( because it was planted there by them in the first place ) , shows that Christianity came from Judaism . This is nonsense , and shows the lengths they will go to , in order to obtain for themselves Jewish legitimacy.You must understand that both Jews and Christians use the word messiah , but the meaning of the word is different in each faith.The Christian understanding is that the Messiah , Jesus , died for the sins of the people . The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin . But we are taught in our Bible that no one can die for the sins of another . In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin . [ Deuteronomy 24:16 ] God is not a man , that he should lie ; neither the Son of Man , that he should repent : hath he said , and shall he not do it ? or hath he spoken , and shall he not make it good ?

"Why is alcohol legal ? In the UK the number of alcohol related deaths soars past 20 , 000 per year , and in the USA , the figure is more than double that . It was once illegal in the US , during a period known as prohibition . However , while alcohol use dipped initially , prohibition 's negative effects outweighed the positive ones . One problem is that despite the fact that alcohol was illegal , it was easy to make and import alcohol from outside the US . As well , prohibition did a great deal to contribute to organized crime , which profited of sales of alcohol . Since alcohol consumption was and is still well established in American and British culture , the demand is such that underground organizations would thrive . As such , we would see an increase in crime and probably not a tremendous fall in alcohol-related crime.To add to that , the alcohol-making industry has much more resources than the prohibitionist movement and thus prohibition is also less politically viable for financial reasons.For more info on prohibition , check out the Wikipedia article below .",0

"Are you really offended by swearing ? Do you think profanity is stupid ? I do , I think it is the most superstitious bullshit ever . “ Oh noes , I have said a ‘ bad ’ word , someone is automatically offended ! ” Ridiculous . Anyway , what are your opinions on swearing ? Is it really that bad ? Does it really make people feel uncomfortable or is it just another word in the dictionary ? Is it limiting our rights to freedom of speech to not be able to swear on the radio or in settings like schools ? I personally dont get offended by them because they were always my second language . I do however think they can make a person sound extremely unintelligent when they use them simply for shock value . I think that as we mature though , it does seem to make you cringe when people curse with every other word out of their mouth . I can have a pretty dirty mouth when I get angry , or when I smash my thumb with a hammer or something- but in everyday conversation , whats the point ? Is it to sound `` cool ? '' I remember I used to do it for that reason when I was like 8 , but when the thrill wore off- it just seemed like those words really didnt have any real purpose for being in my sentances , but I didnt get offended by them- more like turned off I guess.If I meet someone and we are just having a conversation , and profanity takes up most of their conversation , I just think they are ignorant for the most part . I am used to it though , so sometimes the profanity seems more natural in certain situations.Taking Gods name in vain though , I think that is absolutely offensive because it is against the religious beliefs of many , whether you understand it or not- it does offend a lot of people.by the way , tranced- you didnt offend me either , you just gave me a bad impression of you . Your comments are ignorant because the truth is , if everyone believed in Jesus there wouldnt be any arguments , so the world wouldnt be so messed up . Like it or not its true , because if everyone believed in something moral - no matter what it is- we would all agree on that morality . So , to show you the ignorance in your statement- it is ridiculous to blame Christians for the worlds troubles when the worlds troubles are rooted in things that go AGAINST Christian belief ! Sometimes a little reason- goes a long way , no matter what your beliefs are .",0

Of course our rights stem from the Bill of Rights which amended the Constitution .

"What is the largest wave ever ridden by a surfer ? When , where and by whom ? I know Greg Noll had his pic taken on a wave 40+ feet high at Wiamea Bay . Since that famous shot was taken I have heard about places off Baja , possibly Todos Santos , which is accessible only by boat and jet skiis . Some of the surf there gets up to 65 feet . Could that be the place ? ? I do n't know . If you have any pictures or can provide a website where I can find this info it would be appreciated . Thanks ! ! It depends on what you define as `` riding a wave '' . There are `` tow-in '' sufers who rely on `` jetskis '' to tow them into waves . These waves are so large and travel so fast that it is impossible for a human-propelled board to match its speed . The traditionalist of the sport do not consider that truly `` surfing the wave '' . There is a contest that awards , both the surfer and photographer a monetary award if they can produce a picture proving they rode the biggest wave . I do know in the past that a prize was awarded to a team capturing a picture at Todos Santos . Peahi aka Jaws , off of Maui is arguably the largest waves ridden .

I 'm in my 30 's now and am finally starting to get over the shyness . I still find it hard to talk to people I do n't know and to make friends . What I have found is that everyone else has insecurities just like me . Some people are just better at overcoming them.Some things I have found that work for me are going out with a best friend and some of her/his friends . That way you already know someone in the group and can gradually build relationships with the other members of the group . Go out and do something fun with them a few times so you can reminisce about those times to break the ice.I really have a tough time coming up with things to talk about with other people , so what I have done is read newspapers and magazines and watch TV that has interests like those of a person I am interested in getting to know . That way I have something to talk about . I never was one for meeting men . That is until one man at work caught my eye . We said polite hellos to each other , but that just was n't enough . I finally got up the nerve to talk to him . I walked right up , stuck out my hand , and said , `` I ca n't believe you have been here this long and I still do n't know your name .

"In the Rh blood group categorization , what does Rh stand for ? Rh simply means Rhesus . When we are born we recieve 3 rhesus genes from each of our parents that make up what our blood time will eventually be.Specifically : 'We all inherit a set of three Rhesus ( Rh ) genes from each parent called a haplotype . You may have heard of the c , d , e , C , D and E genes . The upper case letters denote Rh positive genes and the lower case , negative and we inherit either a positive or negative of each gene from each parent ( eg . CDe/cde , cdE/cDe etc. ) . This means that we then possess two of each gene and can pass either to our offspring .

"What is the holyghost ? Holy Ghost is a play by Dr. Jon Tuttle , Playwright-in-Residence and Literary Manager at Trustus Theatre in Columbia , South Carolina , and Professor of English at Francis Marion University . Tuttle 's other works include Drift and The Hammerstone.The play explores the conflicts that result from clashes of myriad sectors of humanity . It is set in 1944 , in a camp in South Carolina for German prisoners-of-war , overseen by black guards who enjoy few of the liberties the prisoners do . While there , the prisoners are subjected to a secret governmental re-education program which , ironically , resembles Goebbels ' Nazi propaganda . One prisoner escapes , equipped only with the lines he ’ s learned playing the lead in a camp production of Abe Lincoln in Illinois , and chased by a black private who sees the pursuit as a quest for acceptance . Their dash across the American South explores the ironies and hypocrisies of the American mythos .",0

"What is lake-effect snow ? Lake effect snow is also know as a snowsquall . It is produced in the winter when cold winds move across long expanses of warmer lake water , picking up water vapor which freezes and is deposited on the lee shores . This effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic effect of higher elevations on the downwind shores . This uplifting can produce narrow , but very intense bands of precipitation , which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow per hour . The areas affected by lake effect snow are called snowbelts.Cold winds in the winter typically prevail from the west-southwest to the northwest in the North Temperate Zone , producing the most dramatic lake effect snow falls on the northeast to south east shores of the Great Lakes . This lake effect produces a significant difference between the snow fall on the eastern and western shores of the Great Lakes . If the air temperature is not low enough to keep the precipitation frozen , it falls as lake effect rain.To can read a detailed article on Lake Snow Effect , Variables Contributing to Lake Effect Snow and Areas Hit By Lake Effect Snow and much more at the following articles : ( 1 ) http : //www.noaa.gov/questions/question_011602.html ( 2 ) http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_effect_snow ( 3 ) http : //www.usatoday.com/weather/tg/wlakeeff/wlakeeff.htm ( 4 ) http : //www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/ ( 5 ) http : //www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap10/lake_effect_snow.html",0

"Why do ugly , fat , dumb , smelly guys have the nerve to be picky about women ? It just annoys me ! ! ! They simply do n't see themselves as having any flaws and do n't want to find any in their women , either . When asked about looks , check out the online personal sites . Most men will claim they are athletic or average frame when the picture clearly does not fit that range . Do they see it ? Probably not because men are taught as children to have high self esteem and just deal with it . Girls are allowed to express what is wrong with them and in turn , continue to struggle with self-image . Maybe if guys were brought up in the same regard , they would start to think like women ... I have always seen gorgeous women that men still find something to pick at ... it baffles me !",0

"I can understand people not believing in God and Christianity or any other religion , but why insult it ? Why is it ok to curse , be mean to people , talk about and exploit sex , etc . in public and everywhere you go , but if you speak of God , Pray , or wear clothing with scriptures or anything like that you are offending people ? Even if you do n't believe in God and religion , look at the people who truly do believe and live their lives by the Word . Look at how they act . They are kind , caring , respectful and they donate money to charities and volunteer for things . So whether or not you think God is real , the people who do have become better people because of their belief . So in my mind 's eye , those who believe with their heart and confess with their mouth Jesus is indeeed our Saviour are 1 : If it 's all real then they are going to spend eternity with the Father 2 : Either way they are really good people.As for me I believe without a doubt but I struggle with living right . I have had a few experiences that made my belief stronger than ever . I still have to work on how I lead my life . Let 's face it -- it 's easier to insult or make fun of believers than to put that mantle on.You know what it 's like -- it 's not called `` the straight and narrow '' for nothing . I would n't say it 's true for all , but for many it 's just a case of not seeing any kind of benefit -- material , I 'm pretty sure -- to justify their committiment of time , let alone sacrifice.Why do you think so many people question God 's lack of intervention in natural disasters or tragic deaths ? These people all think it 's some kind of cause/effect relationship . You screw up -- God bails you out . If things go wrong , there ca n't be a God -- otherwise He 'd have stopped it.So many of these people are just jaded from the bombardment of so much content that they absorb -- TV , movies , the Internet . There 's plenty of crap to catch hold of , I have no doubt.They 're just so busy trying to disprove our beliefs they ca n't bother seeing the kinds of people they insult . As far as that goes , most of these folks see Christians as one big happy Pat Robertson family . Unfortunately , those that speak the loudest get the most attentio.I always figure every post from one of these folks is just another opportunity for me to witness . Maybe 99 times I 'll just be wasting my time . But who knows about the other 1 ? None of us are perfect , but you are certainly walking the right path . Let these lost souls both strengthen your faith and provide you a powerful incentive to keep witnessing God 's love and Jesus ' sacrifice for our sins . Go in peace and go with God.While I stand behind all the words I wrote above , I felt I had to add to this post in reaction to your additonal comments about prayer in school . I do n't know exactly what the context is , but I find it very troubling . As a Christian , I believe prayer to be the most direct link I have with God . But the notion that prayer should somehow be forced upon students or encouraged in a public school is not just unconstitutional but morally repugnant to me . Even voluntary prayer is patently coersive in my opinion . I think you are a well-meaning but misguided person who does need to work more on how you lead your life . A little bit more tolerance for those who do n't share your beliefs would be as welcome as others ' tolerance for yours .",0

"why does society say the skinnier you are , the prettier and more accepted you will be ? I think it 's based off of society valuing what influential and rich people that they iconize look like . The `` elite '' have the time and resources to devote to looking their `` best '' and usually that best is the opposite of what the average person in society looks like.In the US it 's hard to stay fit because most of us do n't have jobs that keep us physically fit ( or in the case of kids , they do n't `` get out and play '' as much as they used to ) . Also the cheapest food that is available is the worst for you but is the highest quantity that most people in the US consume which leads to so many people being overweight . So the opposite ( being skinny ) is what 's idolized . Mostly it 's wealthy people who have time to excersize and `` personal trainers '' and such to help them stay fit ... the rest of us are on our own.Back a few hundred years ago , if you were overweight it was a major status symbol because adequate nutrition was hard to come by , and if you had enough food to be fat , you must have been really well off . Again , what was attractive was the opposite of the average person who had to work hard at manual labor and probably did n't get enough to eat and so was skinny.Tanning is another example ... a while ago it was considered unattractive because if you were tanned it meant you were some serf working outside all day instead of being able to stay inside away from the sun . Now it 's the wealthy that have the most leisure time to spend outdoors so tanning is what 's considered attractive .",0

"Who decides what is politically correct ? Support your answer please . Politically correct is a term that I think refers to respect for minorities . It 's basically a way of speaking that attempts to respect others by adopting the same language they use when referring to themselves , or the issues that are of most importance to them . It is a reflection of our national values of equality and equal rights.Because of the nature of opression , majority groups such as Men , Christians and Whites are usually much less affected by slurs , racism , etc , because they are not living with the legacy of discrimination and opression in the recent past.To answer the question , I would say that the minorities themselves would be the ones who decide what is and is not disrespectful , racist , or politically correct from their perspective.For example , many black people prefer to be called `` African Americans '' rather than black or negro or other such words . Some of those worlds have been used throughout our history and are strongly connected with opression and discrimination . Knowing this , we can choose to respect those wishes and adopt that speech , or we can reject it outright.Asian-Americans may feel that being called `` oriental '' is offensive to them , as the word has it has taken on a negative historical connotation , in books and spoken words throuought the years.Women might find it offensive to be called `` the little lady '' or `` girls '' , as this may harken back to a time when people thought of women as inferior to men or needing of male guidance , so they prefer to be called women.Basically I think that political correctness is a choice that you make to respect or disrespect minorities when you are discussing issues of race or gender in public .",0

Central HVAC will be cheaper than wall hung units . Plumbing - purchase the low end of well know suppliers .

All of these skills help in other areas of your life , as well as in other sports . You obviously have to decide based on your personal interests and skills , but I would recommend that you strongly consider golf .",0
"Why is this Alito guy such big news ? I 've been reading about this Alito guy but I do n't understand why is such big news . From what I understand he 's being interviewed for Judge of the Supreme Court . Is there a piece of information I 've missed ? Why is that such big news ? It just seems like a regular political process . It is a regular political process . True , the parties are bickering as usual , but there has always been controversy surrounding new Supreme Court justices . If everyone 's political party was swiched ( Bush would become a Democrat , for example ) , the exact same ranker would be going on . Justices are the top echelon of the legal system , so they are very important . Also , they are appointed for life , so you had better make sure you 're picking the right guy . Unfortunately , Mr. Alito is being confirmed during a particularly nasty period of political polarization , so many of the questions and issues are n't real questions , they 're sensationalist propaganda from both sides of the isle . In case you missed the memo , abortion is NOT the only legal question of the day , yet that seems to be what most of the fuss is about . Lastly , since they are appointed for life , this man has the potential power to influence American jurisprudential thought for perhaps the next 30 or 40 years . Needless to say , he 'll be making rulings long after Bush is gone , and the next guy , and the next guy . He 'll also survive Republicans losing their majority in Congress , then gaining it , then losing it , etc . So essentially , theres a big fuss because they are getting ready to install someone who is going to effecting law ( and by extention politics ) for many years to come . I personally think the Court will be fine with Alito because , unlike the talking heads on CNN and FoxNews who seem fixated on abortion and other trivial matters , I 've been watching the hearings live and reading the transcripts ( I 'm a law student ) , and he actually seems less polarizingly conservative and more qualified than even Republicans are admitting to .",0

"If we can be baptised by the holy spirit , do we need to be baptised by water ? I read in the `` acts '' that Jesus told the apostles that from now that baptism will be by the holy spirit , while john baptised by water . Does that mean baptism is not a necessary process ? should we say that `` when we enter the kingdom of God , we will be baptised by the holy spirit '' .NOTE : any answers that has nothing to do with this question will never ever get 10 points and will never be put in voting , this is in order to serve the community and more people , this is a serious quesiton . God bless you . The absence of water baptism does not disqualify one from entering into the Kingdom of heaven , in example ; the thief on the cross goes to paridise without water baptism or for that matter without the baptism of the holy spirit ( since Jesus is not dead as a man yet ) Jesus does command us to get baptized in water as a symbol for expressing an inward change by showing an outward appearance .",0
"If we are on earth , are weight and mass equal . why or why not ? No matter where you are , weight and mass are different things . Mass is a measurement of a quantity of matter , while weight is a measurement of the force of gravity on a given mass . Mass is an inherent quality in an object that does n't change , no matter where it is . Weight can change depending on where the object is . If you were to choose a set of units where either your mass or the acceleration due to gravity were equal to 1 at some point on earth , then your mass and weight would have an equal value , but that would only be true in those units , for your mass , at that point on earth , and does n't mean that the two concepts are equal .

"teenage drinking has become a problem in our society why ?

Our social mores consider `` drinking '' a rite of passage .

A control over the Media and advertisment will also be needed . Much Like the ban on smoking , a campaign is needed to reach this eventual goal .

"Why do people not help others as a matter of course ? If I meet someone , and they need help of some kind , I do everything in my power to help them . Others will say 'I 'm too busy , ' or 'That 's their problem ' . What has happened to the world ? It has sadly become far too focused on itself . If you need more proof , just take a look around at the number of people engaged in a cell phone conversation in public.It seems to me our entire culture has turned in on itself , making it ever more convenient to separate ourselves from the world . Technology has become a double-edged sword , providing us with amazing new ways to be more productive and organized , but often at the expense of human interaction . Communicaton and entertainment devices provide us with amazing mobility , but our Blackberrys and iPods only further cut us off from one another.Of course , technology is n't the whole problem . Our culture has also become incredibly jaded and disenfranchised , always expecting the worst from others and usually getting it . We use childish , egotistical athletes as role models , making life all about `` getting paid '' . Our fascination with celebrity has become an obsession -- just check out the ratings for `` reality '' shows . And our domestic and international political views are too often shaped by sound bites and media talking heads . Apparently it 's just easier to agree with someone than figure it out yourself.I do n't believe it has to be like this . Our technological advancements do n't have to come with a price that devalues our very existence . And we do not just have to accept that the world with all its troubles is simply beyond redemption . We simply have to want to be involved in the lives of others . How do we do that ? Parents have to care more about their kids ' relationships with others ( not to mention their own ) than they do about making sure they 're doing the right things . We have to educate on how to use technology to collaborate , instead of to isolate . We have to look harder for our heroes . Let 's face it -- the one thing 9/11 taught Americans was who they really were . In short , we all have to love ourselves and life and be obsessed about them less .",0

And I wish he would do a new rock album that does n't suck ( did anyone actually enjoy Human ? ) or rely on recycling all his old rock songs in ANOTHER Greatest Hits type album.Having said all that , I am a lifelong fan , having followed Rod ( emotionally ) through all the good and bad .

Did anyone notice , esp during the rock portion of the concert , that he just seems more comfortable than ever ? He had an easiness in his walk , a peace on his face , a smoothness in his voice , none of which had to do with his experience in the limelight . Comments ? Anyone agree ? If so , why ? Rod Stewart puts on a great show . I think with his age has come a sense of confidence..He does seem more relaxed ... Last show I saw ( year ago ) his daughter came out and did a song..he looked so proud..However , the second half of the show was a drop..doing all the old stuff..sounded great , but not expected..Rod just isnt the big band type .

"whats the most effective treatment to kill lice eggs ? killing the bugs has n't been the problem those eggs are.I just want her hair pretty and shiney again and for this problem gone for good .I know to wash everything and to spray bedding and furniture.Thanks The problem is that you ca n't kill the eggs . The nits are encased in a very strong type substance that can not be penetrated . The most important thing is to retreat the hair after 7 to 10 days and you HAVE to get all the nits out by hand or by comb . I find those plastic combs ineffective . I ordered a metal comb called medi comb from a dealer on ebay . It works the best but you will still need to hand pick some . They are such a pain ! Also using hair styling products ( after hair is nit/lice free ) daily helps prevent reinfestation from contant with others ( at school/bus/etc. ) . I also flat iron/or hot iron curl her hair at times or braid it . Anything that keeps it back or helps to kill those pests ! Also watch closely the friends they play with and if you see any kind of scratching check the child immediately and send them home to tell their parents if you find any nits or anything . Check over the ears and nape of the neck . Also they do make lice repellent spray that you can order ( search online ) it 's mostly tea tree oil , eucalyptus , geranium , and other essential oils mixed with water but it could help if your child is in close proximity of other children and lice is a reoccurring problem . Prevention is the best medicine .",0
"Where in the constitution does it say we have a right to privacy ? There is no specific right to privacy granted in the constitution .

"Is forgiveness possible ? My husband cheated a lot before we got married , mostly with people he met from the internet . Now I have a problem with him being online . Is it possible to let this go and forgive/forget ? If you knew he was cheating before you got married , more than likely he 's cheated or is wanting to cheat since you 've been married . This was not a secret that was kept from you and you knew what you were getting into before you got married . Do this , ask yourself these questions : Have you found any evidence that shows he has cheated or is wanting to cheat ? Have you confronted him about it and have you shared your feelings with him about this ? Is this relationship with this person really that important to you ?

You should n't have to have these bad feelings everyday , especially if this person is supose to be your best friend and soulmate .

"how does the earth rotates itself ? Our solar system- the Sun , planets , Kuiper belt and Oort cloud , everything orbiting the sun even many times further than the orbit of Pluto- is thought to have condensed from a vast cloud of interstellar gas some billions of years ago when that cloud was shocked or squeezed by a supernova explosion . The dust and grains that condensed out of the cooling solar gas aggregated to form larger fragments of rock . Chondritic meteorites are basically just such collections of grains and fragments that have been compacted together to form a larger piece of rock and eventually small planetary bodies . Such bodies are termed planetesimals when they become roughly as large as asteroids ( several kilometres to a few hundred kilometres in dimension ) . The larger they grow , the greater the gravitational attraction that the planetesimals exert and hence the more effectively they sweep up additional particles and rock fragments while circling the Sun . ( Britannica CD ) Because that initial shockwave came from a particular direction and because the cloud was not of uniform density , the particles had a net rotation around their center of gravity . Humans subsequently identified that direction as `` counterclockwise as viewed from above the north pole of the sun '' . As the bodies of the solar system grew by accretion , particles swept up from different distances from the center of gravity ( the sun ) had different orbital velocities . Analogously , water swirling down a drain moves slower further and faster closer to the center . Galileo and Newton showed that rotational energy is conserved : The sun and planets ‘ inherited ' their spin from the orbits of their constituent particles , so to speak . Today , some five billion years later , all that rotational energy is still conserved in the rotations and revolutions of the bodies of the solar system . Our solar system is not unchanging , though . Because of gravitational interactions between moons and their planets , between the planets , meteors and comets themselves and interactions between the solar wind and the magnetospheres of the planets , rotational energy is still be ‘ traded ' back and forth : Mercury orbits in a 3:2 resonance with its rotation , our day is getting longer while the moon only shows one face towards us , the rings of the gas giants are temporary phenomena , ... But that 's another story.In other words , An act of GOD",0

"Are you somewhat freaked out by the concept of global warming ? Climate change is a natural thing on earth . The temperature has gone from hot to cold and back again many times over the billions of years that the earth has existed . I always hear people talking about how we are causing global warming to occur . I think we give ourselves too much credit . It 's true that we are accelerating the rate that global warming is occuring , but we are n't going to stop it either . It 's a natural process of the earth . I 'm sure that the human race will find a way to adapt to the change .

"was the 11th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , UN-Constitutionally adopted ? Was the Amendment UN-Constitutional because it was not in Pursuance of the Original Constitution ? The constitution specifically says , `` The Congress , whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary , shall propose Amendments to this Constitution , or , on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States , shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments , which , in either Case , shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes , as Part of this Constitution , when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States , or by Conventions in three fourths thereof , as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress ; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article ; and that no State , without its Consent , shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate . `` They clearly anticipated these amendments modifying the original document . In fact , many of the amendments have revised the original . Changing the election of Senators and Representatives to popular election , changing the way the number of representatives was calculated , changing the day Congress convenes , and allowing income tax are just a few of the major revisions to the original that have come about by the amendments .",0
"What 's your opinion on what will become of American journalist Jill Carroll held hostage in Iraq ? So very sad , I am praying for her and her family . It 's such a frustrating thing . Try to imagine being in her position , she was n't an enemy of her kidnappers and does n't deserve to be where she is now . Her family has got to be completely sick and all the whole world can do is hope the kidnappers come to their senses . This is not the way to accomplish anything , no government can give in to kidnappers demands because if they did there 's be nothing but more kidnapping to get what they want . So we all just sit and hope for the best.I think that no matter what the outcome , the world needs to use this as a way to make people really pay for this kind of act . It can accomplish nothing but more hate and will never profit anyone for their cause . If the world could get with it and realize this it may slow down or stop this kind of action because they 'd realize all they are doing is making themselves less popular and appear to be nothing but psychotic radicals .",0

"How frequently do I use grunt and anteler calls while deer hunting in the rut ? It all depends on where you are hunting and what the buck to doe ratio is . If you are hunting on public property and the buck to doe ratio is 1/5 or worse you will want to be very timid with your calling . For one there is not much competition for does so the fighting does not occur as much and for two if you are on a heavily hunted area and other people are calling wrong or overcalling all they are doing is educating the deer and they will not respond as well to the calling . If you are hunting on private property or in an area where the buck to doe ratio is 1/3 or better the rules will change . You can be more aggressive and make more mistakes and they will not be as costly . I was watching the outdoor channel the other day ( ca n't remember wich program ) but this guy in texas was rattling and grunting constantly , I could n't believe how aggressive he was being and how constant he was doing it , but it was working very effectively . The ranch he was hunting though only allowed the taking of 2-3 deer a year though and the buck to doe ratio was 1/2 . One last comment is that i believe the pre-rut all the way to when the does are just starting to go in to estruess is the best time to grunt and rattle",0
"How does the free market environment encourage the economic and socioeconomic goals sought by society ? Free markets economy is an addendum to the laws of nature . Water flows from high to low till equilized . There is no good or bad about it - it just is . The good is - lower parts can get water , the bad part is that water may cause attrition or floods along the way , or simply be wasted in the lower areas . But movement of resources from resource rich to rosurce poor countries/areas follows the same principle . Survival of the fittest is another way of looking at it . In the resourse hungry countries , people will do anything to survive , including accepting low paid jobs . In the resource rich countries , people are at a higher level of Maslow 's triangle , are more complacent and demanding of higher standards of living . This creates a cycle of abundance and deprivation in various areas of the world - thus a boom is always followed by a boom and vice versa.The overall socio-economic goals of a society include equality for all . Free markets are one way of redistributing wealth and adhering to the supply and demand principles . Culture of consumerism necessitates maximizing affordability - so production has to be at the lowest price . If the demand of the same job is high elsewhere , then thats where the jobs will go.Most issues associated with concept of free economy are detrimental to the wellbeing of vulnerable population . Patent issues cause hundreds of thousand deaths/suicides in India and Africa . It amplifies the divide between the rich and the poor . WHO , GATT , JAFAA and NAFTAA are weapons used to coerce governments of small countries . Instead of waging war and occupying countries , the US uses trade economics to control and occupy countries . So Free Trade has really become an intrument of war rather than the instrument of social justice that it was supposed to be.I guess the free economy is a concept - and just like any other concept it has its good and bad . Often the media portrays only one side of the issue - depending on where you live you get to hear one side of the story .",0

"why do people generally get discusted with gay men but excited w/ the thought of two women ? About half of the guys I know are homophobic . One of my homophobic friends would say stuff like , “ I don ’ t have a problem with gay guys . I just don ’ t want them … around me , ” and “ Gay guys just wan na plunder my a*s. ” It ’ s so common for hetero guys to think that all gay guys wan na do is rape hetero guys . By definition , a phobia is an irrational fear . What ’ s to be afraid of ? Their scathing humor aside , homosexual men are the most harmless things on Earth . Have you ever heard of a gay murderer ? Or a gay thief ? Maybe I haven ’ t been around long enough , but I ’ ve never heard of a criminally deviant homo dude ( although I do know some pretty ghetto dyke hooligans ) . My point is I think most homophobic guys can ’ t explain why they ’ re scared of gay guys.What I think the reason is : The penis is the intrusive genital . Men brandish their penii with a subconscious feeling of superiority over women . And the idea that a man will use that power against his own kind repulses hetero men . Hetero guys like an*l sex ( with a female ) , not because it feels better , but because it shows ownership of the woman he ’ s sodomizing . The notion that they may be owned in the same way scares them.This is not necessarily fact . Just my take on the matter . Hey , I ’ m not man-hating . I ’ m just homo-defending.Guys , you should take it up the a*s every once in a while . Your g-spot is located next to your prostate , accessible only through the butth*le .

"Can diffusion take place in solids ? Yes.Orthoclase feldspar is an example . At high temperatures , Fe will fit into the orthoclase lattice . As temperature drops , the lattice shrinks so that Fe no longer fits . Fe diffuses out of the latice and accumulates along the planes between orthoclase crystal twins . Along the way , it grabs O to produce Fe2O3 . If you look closely at pink granite , usually you will see that the pink grains are actually white and red striped . Those grains are orthoclase crystals with exsolved hematite along twin planes.Exsolution and diffusion of Fe from orthoclase can only occur at high temperature . If the orthoclase cools too quickly for the Fe to diffuse out , it will remain in the orthoclase lattice , which will be distorted to accomodate the larger ( larger than K ) Fe ion.Material science is not boring .",0

"can the government really do illegal actions ? for instence ... can the gov . really lie to the public about different things like terrist acts and catasraphies . iv heard theorise that 9/11 didnt happen by commersial airplains and by types of gov . airplanes and that the CIA kidnapes terrorists and takes them to different countries where they have no laws and torchers them and things like that ? dont worry . this information is from reliable sourses which is why i wounder about this . Of course , various individuals within the American government , as well as larger entities within the government have gotten away with crimes . Check out the story of Ruby Ridge . Sara Weaver war murdered by FBI agent Leon Horiuchi 's sniper fire , as she stood on the doorstep with baby in her arms . The FBI also murdered one of her sons and killed the family dog . The government had to pay Randy Weaver 1.5 million dollars for this fiasco , but the government murderer Leon Horiuchi could never be prosecuted . Similar events happened at the government massacre of innocent civilians at the Branch Davidian church at Waco , Texas . Attorney General Janet Reno and ultimately Bill Clinton , were responsible for those murders , but they and all under them were never prosecuted . Our founders knew that government was a beast which would always grow in power and corruption and tyranny , unless seriously counterpoised by an armed and freedom loving people . Thomas Jefferson said the tree of liberty must be watered from time to time by the blood of patriots and the blood of tyrants . Our second amendment rights and inalienable God given rights to keep and bear arms , has been continually eroded by unconstitutional antigun laws . The people have been brainwashed by the government propaganda centers ( public schools ) that the government is our saviour , and that our rights come from the government , not from God , as the Declaration of Independence so clearly stated . Check out JPFO ( Jews for the Preservation of Firearm Ownership , Aaron Zelman 's group ) , which is the strongest gun rights group . The NRA is nothing but compromising antigun hypocrites.Alex Jones and some others believe that 911 was a conspiracy by the illuminati . Hard to tell . But certainly , if passengers on board those airlines had been able to exercise their constitutional right to keep and bear arms , such a thing could n't have happened . I will not fly if I ca n't take my gun . I will not be subjected to unconstitutional searches getting on the plane like some slave dog . I am a free american . The Patriot Act and similar legislation shows that the government is far more interested in using 911 and similar incidents to attack our rights , rather than to go after the enemy .",0

"Who do you like better Green Day or Linkin Park ? I like Linkin Park . Linkin Park and Green Day ( exept for the album `` American Idiot '' ) are pretty much all I listen to . Here 's why I like Linkin Park the best : > No cussing ( the s-word was on the song `` High Voltage '' , but that 's still not as much as Green Day ) . > The lyrics are much deeper , by far. > The music videos are very creative > So far , Linkin Park has n't had to do any covers of old songs to use as filler on albums , whereas Green Day has done , like , 10. > The musicians themselves are interesting and well rounded people . Mr. Hahn directs the videos , Mike draws/creates album art and can play piano and guitar , as well as write great songs and do his thing as emcee , Phoenix can play violin and cello as well as do his thing as bassist for the band.On , a personal bias , Linkin Park is better because they are ! Plus , they have Chester Bennington . He has a huge vocal range ( whispering > whining > singing > shouting > screaming ) , and could probably sing a song from any musical genre . Of course , he 's a complete psyco , but that makes him an interesting person . And , I can completely relate to some of their songs ( which sometimes freaks me out , on certain songs ) . Also , the songs are louder and more in-your-face than Green Day 's . Sometimes , I like to kick back with a little bit of Green Day , because they 're my second favorite band ( although I ca n't explain why ... ) .",0
"Is drinking coffee bad for you ? Here are some of the benefits and risk of drinking coffee.BenefitsCoffee increases the effectiveness of pain killers—especially migraine medications—and can rid some people of asthma . Some of the beneficial effects may be restricted to one sex , for instance it has been shown to reduce the occurrence of gallstones and gallbladder disease in men . Coffee intake may reduce one 's risk of diabetes mellitus type 2 by up to half . While this was originally noticed in patients who consumed high amounts ( 7 cups a day ) , the relationship was later shown to be linear ( Salazar-Martinez 2004 ) .Coffee can also reduce the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver and prevent colon and bladder cancers . Coffee can reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma , a variety of liver cancer ( Inoue , 2005 ) . Also , coffee reduces the incidence of heart disease , though whether this is simply because it rids the blood of excess fat or because of its stimulant effect is unknown . At the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Washington , D.C. , on August 28 , 2005 , chemist Joe Vinson of the University of Scranton presented his analysis showing that for Americans , who as a whole do not consume large quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables , coffee represents by far the largest source of valuable antioxidants in the diet . [ 4 ] Coffee contains the anticancer compound methylpyridinium . This compound is not present in significant amounts in other food materials . Methylpyridinium is not present in raw coffee beans but is formed during the roasting process from trigonellin , which is common in raw coffee beans . It is present in both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee , and even in instant coffee . 6Coffee is also a powerful stimulant for peristalsis and is sometimes considered to prevent constipation ; it is also a diuretic.Many people drink coffee for its ability to increase short term recall and increase IQ . It also changes the metabolism of a person so that their body burns a higher proportion of lipids to carbohydrates , which can help athletes avoid muscle fatigue.Some of these health effects are realized by as little as 4 cups a day ( 24 U.S. fl oz , 700 mL ) , but others occur at 5 or more cups a day ( 32 U.S. fl oz or 0.95 L or more ) .Some controversy over these effects exists , since by its nature coffee consumption is associated with other behavioral variables . Therefore it has been variously suggested that the cognitive effects of caffeine are limited to those who have not developed a tolerance , or to those who have developed a tolerance and are caffeine-deprived.Practitioners in alternative medicine often recommend coffee enemas for `` cleansing of the colon '' due to its stimulus of peristalsis , although mainstream medicine has not proved any benefits of the practice.RisksMany notable effects of coffee are related to its caffeine content.Many coffee drinkers are familiar with `` coffee jitters '' , a nervous condition that occurs when one has had too much caffeine . Coffee can also increase blood pressure among those with high blood pressure , but follow-up studies showed that coffee still decreased the risk of dying from heart disease in the aggregate . Coffee can also cause insomnia in some , while paradoxically it helps a few sleep more soundly . It can also cause anxiety and irritability , in some with excessive coffee consumption , and some as a withdrawal symptom . There are also gender-specific effects , in some PMS sufferers it increases the symptoms , and it can reduce fertility in women , also it may increase the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women , and there may be risks to a fetus if a pregnant woman drinks 8 or more cups a day ( 48 U.S. fl oz or 1.4 L or more ) .A February 2003 Danish study of 18,478 women linked heavy coffee consumption during pregnancy to significantly increased risk of stillbirths ( but no significantly increased risk of infant death in the first year ) . `` The results",0

"Why Iran Should Stop Researching on Nuclear Knowlage ? With all due respect , sgt_k is a total idiot , learn how to respect others ' opinion then start talking ... back to the topic , well , yes , i agree with yunussh ... for the following reasons : 1- we have known what is the meaning of being told by america that somebody or a country is having a mass destruction weapons , it 's a big lie like what happened in iraq , but iran would never let america do the same thing , simply iran can make what the american would never expect . 2- we know that israel has a nuclear power , it threats all the muslims around it , who knows if they have n't already invent a bomb with a short range of action that , for example , can destroy egypt without affecting israel itself ? , that 's why , countries near israel has the right to defend themselves in the way they can , you ca n't stop iran unless you assure the whole world is having nothing called nuclear power . 3- america is doing all that because of israel , techniquely speaking , iran ca n't threat amecrica in a way or another ! they are thousands of kilos far away , but when it is about israel , yes america can do any idiot step for the sake of israel , why ? because isreal , 10 million people , is controlling every single step america is doing , shame on you american ! finally , do n't ever dream that what happened to iraq will repeat itself , , , american soldiers themselves wo n't accept a new war and now they know that a muslim can really be happy to die when it 's about making strangers out of his country , , leave us alone , or u never be in peace ... gourge bush or any other president , american will never elect a president who hates israel , that 's why we never expcet a good thing from you , america .. now , was it convincing ?",0

"What is igneous rock ? The term comes from the Latin word `` Ignis '' which means fire . Igneous rocks are produced by melting within the earth and later cooling of the molten magma.There are two major subdivisions of igneous rocks : ExtrusiveIntrusiveExtrusive igneous rocks come from volcanic activity . They are `` extruded ' by being ejected from a volcano or being part of a slow moving lava flow on the surface of the earth . Examples : basalt flows , pumice , obsidian , ash , scoriaIntrusive igneous rocks are formed by these molten rocks as they cool within the earth . The slow cooling allows the rock to separate into different minerals and form grains . Large masses of intrusive rocks that harden within the earth are called batholiths and plutons , depending on the size . Examples of intrusive igneous rocks are granite , gabbro , and monzonite .

"definition of discovery teaching approach ? The discovery method is a teaching technique that encourages students to take a more active role in their learning process by answering a series of questions or solving problems designed to introduce a general concept . In this teaching approach , the instructor guides the student ’ s thought process by posing a series of questions whose responses would lead to the understanding of a concept before it is explicitly stated . “ Children act as detectives as they solve concept-attainment activities in stimulating learning environments . In doing so , they place a newly introduced object in a category that they have previously discovered or identified. ” This teaching method is believed to increase retention of material because the student organizes the new information and integrates it with information that has already been stored .",0

Or am I hearing Pätrick Henry , `` Give me Liberty or give me death '' ! Dear Fox , I think I can understand what you mean but maybe their definition of freedom is a little defferent from American standard definition.Iraq specially is an ancient civilization , they have been there for the history ( As you know Babylon was there many years B.C . ) and they have many complicated feelings.Iraq is a holy land for Muslims , if you know Islam history you will understand that this is not a common place with common people , they have their own mythes and they love them . The most powerful Islamic schools are there and people believe in Islamic leaders . Even when they were called for vote they got permission for it from their religious leader . They have been guards of many holy shrines there even before crusade wars . you ca n't tell them how to think about freedom , it seems they find clergy government more free than democracy and they are fighting for freedom.This is very important for US because of Domino theory which US hope to happen in middle east and all other countries there see what a beauty is Democracy in Iraq and try to have one but it will not happen , I think the second US leave the Iraq they will overthrow their government and make a new Islamic-Clergy type .",0

"What kind of lies did the Ku Klux Klan tell ? An why did people go along with it for so long ? There are so many articles about the Klu Klux Klan that it boggles the mind . In a nutshell they - like Nazi Germany - beleived that the white race was omnipotent and that all other races are/were subservient or corrupt in some manner . Therefore they agreed that by process of elimination , they would rule as the all powerful white race . This misguided belief was fueled in part by the rife prejudices in the southern parts of the US . Since they beleived that blacks and other races were not in their white power plan , and these races were no better than dogs and should be treated as such , they proceeded with a process called culling . This is where they mistakenly thought that they could rule society and that everyone would go along with their beliefs . They used the bible and twisted its teachings to enforce their beliefs . A lot of people went along with it , in part , because of the slavery and its abolition in later years , but also because it was the `` Christian '' thing to do . Some thought that if they were true christians they had to go along with it , because they beleived the words of the Grand wizard . The Klu Klux Klan was a secret society for a long time . Mostly joined by angry white southern gentlemen who didnt like the abolition of slavery . I use the term gentlemen loosely . If you google the name it will come up and you can read all about it..",0

"Who ran the fastest forty ever at the combine ? A couple of my guesses would be Deion , Darrell Green , maybe even Mike Vick . Also , who do you think ran the fastest forty ever ... .not just at the combine . There is no official world record for 40 yards.The shortest distance that the IAAF , track and field 's international governing body , recognizes for world-record purposes is an indoor 50 meters , or about 54 yards . It is 5.56 seconds and it was set by Canadian sprinter Donovan Bailey in 1996 . There is also a world record for 60 meters -- 6.39 seconds by American Maurice Greene in 1998.But it is another Canadian , Ben Johnson , who is believed to have run 40 yards faster than any human in history . Johnson is best known for injecting copious amounts of steroids and winning the 100 meters at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul in 9.79 seconds , only to have his gold medal and world record stripped after failing a post-race drug test.Timing officials have since broken down that famed race into 10-meter increments , and Johnson was so preposterously fast that he went through 50 meters in 5.52 seconds and 60 meters in 6.37 -- both under the current world records at those distances . He went through 40 yards that day in 4.38 seconds.He was running in spikes . . . on a warm afternoon perfectly suited for sprinting . . . with a slight tailwind . . . with years of training from arguably track 's top coach , Charlie Francis . . . with Carl Lewis and six others of the fastest men on the planet chasing him . . . with 69,000 people roaring at Seoul 's Olympic Stadium . . . with hundreds of millions of people watching on TV . . . with the ultimate prize in sports , an Olympic gold medal , at stake.And , as we learned later , with muscles built with the assistance of the anabolic steroid stanazolol.Four-point-three-eight seconds.Then again , maybe Ben Johnson is n't the fastest 40-yard man in the world.Maybe half the NFL is faster.o o oIt can be the most important few hours of a football player 's career . It is the day NFL scouts come to campus to determine whether prospects have what it takes to play at the next level.Players are measured to the quarter-inch . They 're weighed to the half-pound . They do a vertical jump and a standing broad jump . They see how many times they can bench-press 225 pounds . They do a 20-yard shuttle drill and something called a three-cone drill . They are put through a short workout specific to their position.But it is something else that commands everyone 's attention , something else that interrupts the businesslike atmosphere of players shuffling from one station to the next . Something else that causes scouts and spectators to snap to attention.The 40-yard dash.It is the day 's shortest event , and the most critical . No other statistic carries more influence for an NFL prospect , no single number has more impact on his draft fortunes . It 's not called Pro Scouting Day or Pro Prospect Day or Pro Workout Day . The sign taped to the weight-room door at San Diego State on March 19 says : `` Pro Timing Day . `` Or as local football agent David Caravantes puts it : `` There 's football speed and there 's 40 speed , and the scouts will all tell you they understand that and game film is the most important thing . But how many defensive backs who ran a 4.6 are left on the draft board ahead of guys who ran 4.3 ? `` I 'll give you another example . There 's this DB who was originally projected as a first-rounder . But he did n't run the 40 that fast -- something like 4.6 instead of in the 4.4s -- and now they 're talking about him slipping to the second round . Well , he 's looking at a minimum $ 4 million signing bonus if he goes in the first round and only about $ 1.6 million if he goes in the middle of the second round . `` You do the math . `` The players are inside the SDSU weight room being measured and weighed .

X=2 : We showed that X < =2 and ( X=2 or X=4 ) , you draw the conclusion .",0

God ) ... to express compassion ... to find inner peace ... to gain and exercise power ... to give and receive love ... to give life meaning ( an example of antimetabole ) ... to learn and find enlightenment ... to leave a legacy , such as a work of art or a book ... to live in peace with each other , and in harmony with our natural environment ( see utopia ) ... to produce offspring through sexual reproduction ... to produce useful structure in the universe over and above consumption ( see net creativity ) ... to pursue a dream , vision , or destiny ... to relate , connect , or achieve unity with others ... to seek and acquire virtue , to live a virtuous life ... to seek and find beauty ... to seek freedom , either physically , mentally , financially , or spiritually ... to seek happiness and flourish , experience pleasure or celebrate ... to seek truth , knowledge , understanding , or wisdom ... to serve others , or do good deeds ... to simply live until one dies ( there is no universal or celestial purpose , existence has no meaning beyond which one chooses to give it ) ... to survive , including the pursuit of immortality through scientific means ( see life extension ) ... to try to understand the meaning of life ... to work for justice and democracy ... to worship , serve , or achieve union with God ... or some combination of the above",0
"Why do people ask you `` how are you ? '' When they do n't really care ? Not all people ask that . In Malaysia they ask `` Where are you going ? `` , `` Have you eaten yet ? '' or `` Have you taken your bath yet ? '' . Like Americans , they do n't really care , and the questions are not rude ; it is just a standard greeting.Asking about your health was considered slightly rude , since the state of your internal organs was your business . `` How are you '' is the accepted opening question in the US of A and several other countries . It is just a polite greeting . I used to be offended when people would ask me where I was going , when I was in Malaysia . Then I realized it was just the polite greeting for their culture . If , for instance , someone was going to rob a bank , they would not say so . You have probably seen people on crutches greeted with `` how are you ? '' and heard them reply `` Fine '' .If you visit someone in a hospital and ask how they are doing , you expect a long answer . If you pass them on the street , you do n't ; just a polite ( and empty ) phrase .",0

"What is Eid al Adha ? Eid ul-Adha ( Arabic : عيد الأضحى ) occurs on the tenth day of the Islamic month of Dhul Hijja . It is one of two Eid festivals that Muslims celebrate . Eid ul-Adha is celebrated by Muslims worldwide as a commemoration of Prophet Ibrahim 's willingness to sacrifice his son for God.Muslims believe that God revealed in a dream to Ibrahim ( Prophet Abraham ) to sacrifice his son Isma ’ il . Ibrahim and Isma ’ il set off to Mina for the sacrifice . As they went , the devil attempted to persuade Ibrahim to disobey God and not to sacrifice his beloved son . But Ibrahim stayed true to God , and drove the devil away . As Ibrahim prepared to sacrifice his son , God stopped him and gave him a sheep to sacrifice instead . The story is also a part of the other Abrahamic religionsIt is celebrated on the 10th day of the month of Dhul Hijja ( ذو الحجة ) of the lunar Islamic calendar , after Hajj , the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia . This happens to be approximately 70 days after the end of the month of Ramadan.While Eid ul-Fitr is considered to be three days , Eid ul-Adha is supposed to be four days . The first day is the primary holiday , on which men , women , and children are expected to dress in their finest clothing and perform prayer ( Salah ) in a large congregation . Muslims who can afford to do so sacrifice domestic animals , usually sheep , as a symbol of Ibrahim 's sacrifice ; this sacrifice is called `` Qurban . '' The meat is distributed amongst their neighbors , relatives , and the poor and hungry . The charitable instincts of the Muslim community are demonstrated during Eid ul-Adha by the concerted effort to see that no impoverished Muslim is left without sacrificial food during this day . Coming immediately after the Day of Arafat ( when Muhammad pronounced the final seal on the religion of Islam ) , Eid ul-Adha gives concrete realization to what the Muslim community ethic means in practice .",0

"Why do some people grind their teeth when they sleep ? Teeth grinding , or bruxism , is often related to stress . It also can be caused by crooked or missing teeth or by something that creates an abnormal bite , such as a high spot on a molar . To diagnose bruxism , dentists look for flattened spots on the teeth . Treatment includes smoothing down those high spots and behavior modification for stress reduction . Your dentist also may recommend a mouth guard or a custom-made splint to be worn at night . These prevent teeth from coming together , which interrupts the grinding and gives muscles a chance to relax.Here 's some more information : Bruxism can have a variety of psychological and physical causes . These include stress , the body 's reaction to poor tooth alignment , as a complication of severe brain injury , or as an uncommon side effect of some antidepressant medications .",0

"Why is the ocean blue ? It might sound like i 'm joking.. But i really need to know . Is it because it 's reflecting off the sky ? Water is faint blue . Although water appears clear in small quanities ( like a glass of water ) , the blue color becomes visible the more water we look through . Thus , deep lakes and seas are bluer than a shallow river.Other factors can affect the color we see : 1 . Particles and solutes can absorb light , as in tea or coffee . Green algae in rivers and streams often lend a blue-green color . The red sea has occasional blooms of red Trichodesmium erythraeum algae . 2 . Particles in water can scatter light . The Colorado river is often muddy red because of suspended reddish silt in the water . Some mountain lakes and streams with finely gound rock , such as glacial flour , are tourquise . Light scattering by suspended matter is required in order that the blue light produced by water 's absorption can return to the surface and be observed . Such scattering can also shift the spectrum of the emerging photons toward the green , a color often seen when water laden with suspended particles is observed . 3 . The surface of seas and lakes often reflect blue skylight , making them appear bluer . [ [ [ Montana reflection . ] ] ] The relative contribution of reflected skylight and the light scattered back from the depths is strongly dependent on observation angle .",0

"what is the function of stipules ? wha is the importance of stipules ? There are a number of interesting functions demonstrated for stipules of certain plant species.Also protection of emerging leaves . 1 . Stipules that are green may be leaf-like ( Examples : flowering quince , a geranium , and a sycamore ) , linear , thread-like , or reduced to minute scales , thereby requiring a hand lens to see . Plant biologists have assumed that green stipules are photosynthetic , but ecophysiologists generally have not determined how significant green stipules may be as temporary or persistent photosynthetic structures . Anatomical reports on photosynthetic stipules are exceedingly rare , so that we know little about the presence of stomates and the nature of the mesophyll in stipules . 2 . If hardened with lignin , a stipule may become modified as a spine , i.e. , a stipular spine . In many species , one stipular spine or a pair of stipular spines may be observed at each node , e.g. , among legumes , and for legumes , the stipular spine is the typical type of shoot armature ( Examples : coral tree , Chloroleucon , and a mimosa ) . Obviously , stipular spines were effective in their specific native habitat for many of these cases as an adaptation to reduce predation by vertebrate herbivores . Very large , hollow stipular spines in certain species of bull acacia ( Acacia , Family Mimosaceae ) serve as homes for ants , which defend the plant from all other herbivores . Stipular spines are extremely important forms of shoot armature for the succulent euphorbs ( Family Euphorbiaceae ; examples : crown-of-thorns , young stipular spines , and old stipular spines ) , most species of which occur in thorny scrub and woodland as well as desert habitats in Africa and southern Asia . Stipular spines also are present on certain climbers . 3 . In many groups of plants , stipules are short-lived , nonphotosynthetic structures that abscise before the leaf is fully expanded ( a legume ) . Such stipules tend to be nongreen , often hyaline ( an elm ) , off-white ( ramie ) , yellow , or brownish , but there are some remarkable cases where the stipule is brilliantly colored , especially with anthocyanins , red to purple vacuolar pigments ( Talauma hodgsonii ) . A nongreen stipule probably can be regarded as vestigial , lacking any function for the mature leaf and shoot but perhaps protecting the young leaf while it is at the growing tip . 4 . Sometimes stipules and stipels have evolved as extrafloral nectaries , utilized to nourish mutualistic ants , or other types of glands . 5 . In Smilax , a lianaceous monocotyledon , the stipule may develop as a tendril . 6 . For whatever function , corky stipules are known from certain dryland shrubs , for example , the species of creosote bush ( Larrea young stipules of L. tridentata and older stipules in L. nitida ) in New World deserts and the tough-leaved evergreen species of Ceanothus in California chaparral .",0

"i want to know about climate change in whole world ? Climate change refers to the variation in the Earth 's global climate or regional climates over time . It describes changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere - or average weather - over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years . These changes may come from internal processes , be driven by external forces or , most recently , be caused by human activities.In recent usage , especially in the context of environmental policy , the term `` climate change '' is often used to refer only to the ongoing changes in modern climate , including the average rise in surface temperature known as global warming . In some cases , the term is also used with a presumption of human causation , including in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) . The UNFCCC uses `` climate variability '' for non-human caused variations . ( For a more extensive discussion please refer to the link provided )",0
"What is Socialism ? The following is an excerpt of an essay written by Albert Einstein . This essay was originally published in the first issue of Monthly Review ( May 1949 ) . `` This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism . Our whole educational system suffers from this evil . An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student , who is trained to worship acquisitive success as a preparation for his future career.I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils , namely through the establishment of a socialist economy , accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals . In such an economy , the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion . A planned economy , which adjusts production to the needs of the community , would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man , woman , and child . The education of the individual , in addition to promoting his own innate abilities , would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.Nevertheless , it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is not yet socialism . A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual . The achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems : how is it possible , in view of the far-reaching centralization of political and economic power , to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and overweening ? `` Short Answer ...

It is a period of 40 days when Catholics remember the 40 days Jesus fasted in the desert and his ultimate sacrifice at the end of Lent , Good Friday . Marti Gras ( french for Fat Tuesday ) has traditionally become the time for celebration as a last big fling before Lent arrives and people try to restrict themselves more . Also , during Lent , Catholics are supposed to avoid meat other than fish on fridays . On Ash Wednesday , Catholics go to a church service during which the entire congregation processes up to have the priest place ashes on their forehead as a reminder that `` of dust we were made and to dust we shall return '' and our own mortalities .",0
"How do you start looking for Venture Capital Funding ? For an online company , located in a small rural area , that has been in business for over 5 years , how does one go about attracting venture capital funds and investors ? Venture Capital is just another name for private investor . There are some private investor groups but they are not well advertised . Typically a venture capitalist does not engage in the business of private investing because there is usually no or very little return on the investment . They expect to get their money back at best . That 's why it is hard to find them , it 's not a business . However , there are some organizations that provide business resources , councilling , consulting , advice , and these are usually staffed by successful business people . The chamber of commerce in your city and the state will provide you with local information . Often , those groups will point you in the right direction for fund raising . Another resource is to join a country club and/or a golf club where business executives tend to favor . Networking is key to many aspects of business success .

"CAN ANYBODY CLARIFY ? If a person suffered from amnesia and then was cured would they remember that they forgot ? It is hard to say.The underlying cause of amnesia is critical to answer this question.If you are talking a traumatic event to the brain , then the memories could be permanetly lost . The physical structure of the brain could have been damaged beyond repair and the information contained there would be lost.Sometimes , the area is just injured and takes time to heal . In this case , over time the memories would begin to come back as the brain reroutes synapses to accommodate the injury.If it was a psychological amensia , then it may or may not come back depending on how the person can cope with the experience . In this case , there is usually very little physical brain involvment.In general , in a highly stressfulevent , adrenalize and stres hormones cause memory to be faulty at best . So in an crisis people rarely recollect events in the most accurate manner.For a whole lot of unsubsantiated opinion , see the Wikipedia entry : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmnesiaOr for Types of amnesia : http : //ahsmail.uwaterloo.ca/kin356/amnesia/amnesia2.htmlhttp : //www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php ? newsid=9673For a better reference check out http : //news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/a-b/167771.stm",0
"How do I tell if my wife 's affair went further than the internet and casual meetings ? She has been meeting with this coworker after meetings and IM each other .

My wife says it was just a crush and nothing physical . I 'm not sure this is the truth , since she lied about everything else , until I found out for myself . Lying is part of the Affair . First print a hard copy of the BLog , and all Emails for future referance . Chances are it has gone farther and she is covering it up . The only way to get through the lies is to catch her in the act . I suggest you contact a private investagetor to look into the matter , They have knowledge and resourses that you would not have , plus by having a third party you get honest information and not biased based on how you feel . Now if you learn that she is not cheating , `` yet '' then I suggest you work on the relationship before she does . I would suggest you seek help in counciling . Your not going to be able to resolve the issue by yourself . She is looking at other men probably due to an unmet `` NEED '' at home .

"The End Times : Great Revival or Great Apostasy ? Many prophecies in mainstream Christianity have come out declaring a great influx ( revival ) of souls into the Kingdom of God before Jesus returns . Why then does Jesus declare : And then shall many be offended , and shall betray one another , and shall hate one another . And many false prophets shall rise , and shall deceive many . And because iniquity shall abound , the love of many shall wax cold . But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved . ( Matthew 24:10-13 ) And why would He ask : ... Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ? ( Luke 18:8 ) Just curious to hear others ' opinions ... 2 Thes . 2:1-3 ( NKJV ) Now , brethren , concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him , we ask you , [ 2 ] not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled , either by spirit or by word or by letter , as if from us , as though the day of Christ had come . [ 3 ] Let no one deceive you by any means ; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first , and the man of sin is revealed , the son of perdition , ______________I do not believe in the `` Left Behind '' rapture theory that is being preached in a lot of churches today.There will be a great falling away when the tribulation comes upon us all . It will not be easy being a Christian . Many will depart from us because they are not Christians.The end will not have a great revival . Even the current revivals are not great . I do not see many strong Christians . I see a lot of people professing Christ with their mouths but not with their lives and producing fruit.Where 's the fruit ? No fruit ? No Christian.Luke 3:9 ( NKJV ) And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees . Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire .

I think there is a lot of awareness that there is a thing called autism . But people are woefully ignorant of what autism is like . I know I 've mentioned that my niece has autism & people have said things like `` Have you ever taken her to Las Vegas ? '' Then I have to explain that `` Rain Man '' was FICTION ! Even though the character was inspired by some real people , Hollywood got a hold of the script & had to exsagerate . And `` Autism '' can mean so many things , too . One of the questions here included a description of `` geeks watching Star Trek '' as autism . I guess they were refering to Aspergers . When I hear people saying things like `` Autism does n't need treatment or a cure '' I ca n't help but think they must be refering to Aspergers.Then there 's strict autsim . My brother would keep his baseball mitt mearby for when his daughter would have fits . He 'd use it to `` catch '' her head as she was trying to bang it on tables , walls , or the floor .

It is sown in corruption , it is raised in incorruption : 43 it is sown in dishonor , it is raised in glory : it is sown in weakness , it is raised in power : 44 it is sown a natural body , it is raised a spiritual body . There is a natural body , and there is a spiritual body . 45 And so it is written , The first man Adam was made a living soul ; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit . 46 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual , but that which is natural ; and afterward that which is spiritual . 47 The first man is of the earth , earthy : the second man is the Lord from heaven . 48 As is the earthy , such are they also that are earthy : and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly . 49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy , we shall also bear the image of the heavenly . 50 Now this I say , brethren , that flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God ; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption . 51 ¶ Behold , I show you a mystery ; We shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed , 52 in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trump : for the trumpet shall sound , and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed . 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption , and this mortal must put on immortality . 54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption , and this mortal shall have put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory . 55 O death , where is thy sting ? O grave , where is thy victory ? 56 The sting of death is sin ; and the strength of sin is the law . 57 But thanks be to God , which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ . 58 ¶ Therefore , my beloved brethren , be ye steadfast , unmovable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord .",0

"Where do EBAY powersellers get their merchandise ? It has to do with being at the right place and at the right time . Many of the big powersellers have had access to low cost products in several ways . 1 . Discontinued products . Many times , a product line gets discontinued with a newer model . The older model becomes very difficult to sell . Someone comes in and agree to buy the whole lot for a fraction of the manufactor 's price . It helps the retailer keep their products fresh and minimizes loss.2 . Refurbished . Manufactor refurbishes a product and sells it in a white box for a fraction of the price of the original product sold in the retail box . Manufactors get the products from the retailers as a returned item and has to credit the retailer . This gives the manufactor an opportunity to recover the loss . Some powersellers established a business relationship with the manufactor to purchase those refurbished products.3 . Retailer Returns . A powerseller may have signed a deal with a retailer that says they 'll pay cents on the dollar for everything the retailer gets returned.So lets say retailer buys something for $ 10 from the manufactorer and sells it to the consumer for $ 25 . Items will always get returned either damaged , unopened , or opened and for any variety of reasons . If the retailer returns it to the manufactorer , they may get a credit of about $ 1 or $ 2 . The powerseller buys the products for $ 3 , $ 4 , or $ 5 . Taking the chance , they know that at least a minimum % of the products to be working and can sell the working products.4 . Directly from the manufactor or distributor . As more products you buy in bulk , the greater the discount the manufactor give the buyer .",0
"What can be done to imporove peripheral artery disease ? vze2wy4t RN , I believe you are thinking of venous disease ( as in varicose veins ) when you suggest elevating the limb . Although walking , and smoking cessation are the first steps . Support hose are to help improve VENOUS return.In lower extremity arterial occlusive disease the dependent position ( ie feet down ) aids in circulation to the smaller blood vessels in the feet and lower extremeties . Many patients who complain of pain at rest , have a history of having worse pain at night while in bed sleeping , with relief from `` dangling their feet from the side of the bed '' . Before you decide to do anything , see your physician if you have not already done so . There are other disease proceses that may mimic peripheral artery occlusive disease . If it is arterial disease he will be able to better answer your questions , after a good examination . If it is warranted , ( after more involved tests ) referal to a vascular surgeon might be necessary . Good luck.http : //www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml ? identifier=4692",0
"What exactly do stem cells do ? I 've come across a product that claims to promote the release of adult stem cells : what would be the benefit of that ? Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can , under the right conditions , turn into any other kind of cell . They are of particular interest to scientists in that they may provide a means to replace damaged cells that the body can not naturally replaced ( in the spinal chord , for example ) . Stem cells are often talked about ( not inacurately ) in the context of curing numerous degenerative neurological conditions ( Parkinsons , Altzeimers , ALS , etc . ) as well as other conditions that can be traced to the malfunction of a particular type of cell ( they could be used , for example , to replace insuline-sectreteing cells in type I diabetes ) .Although I have not heard of a product like the one you mentioned , I would be inclined to say it does absolutely nothing . Stem cells are only useful if they can be made to differentiate and become a specific type the specific type of cell that is needed , where that type of cell is needed . Flooding the body with stem cells will not make that happen . My best guess is that it is an attempt to profit off the wide-spread association of the term `` stem cell '' with curing uncurable diseases and , by extention , with improved health in general .",0

"How are geodes formed , where are found and what minerals do they contain ? Geodes ( Greek geoides , `` earthlike '' ) are geological formations common to the United States ( Indiana , Iowa , and Kentucky ) , Brazil , and Mexico . Essentially rock bubbles with internal crystal formations , the exterior of a geode is generally limestone or a related rock , while the interior contains quartz crystals and/or chalcedony deposits . Other geodes are completely filled with crystal , being solid all the way though . These types of geodes are called nodules.Geologists do not yet have a widely accepted theory about how geodes are formed , but it is believed geodes can form in any cavity that is buried . These can be bubbles in igneous rocks , pockets under tree roots , bubbles in lava after a volcanic eruption , or even animal burrows . Over time , the external wall of the cavity hardens , and dissolved silicates and/or calcites are deposited on the inside surface . Over time , this slow feed of minerals allows crystals to form inside the hollow chamber . Then , over millions of years , the geode makes its way back to the surface through normal geologic processes.Follow the link for more information.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geode",0

"How can I start a prison ministry in my church and have it remain safe for children ? Your church should already have guidelines of who should be allowed to be near the children .

We try to have more women than men work with the children.After classes are done , it is the parents responsibility to keep an eye on their children . We return their children directly to the parent and do n't just let the children loose to roam the church grounds.With rules and guidelines in place , a prison ministry should be fine . Pedophiles are required to let the town they move to know about their background . You can check your local listings . They will have a picture of the person and the crime they have committed .

"When and how will U.S. Congress and the White House succeed in destroying the Middle Class American ? It is readily apparent that the Wilsonian Global Market Economy has affected the American job market ; and , will continue to so for the next several years.In addition , it is widely known by many who are not deaf , dumb , and blind that the US Government has begun to do so -- more so in the last 20 years.In actuality , the post-industrial era is all but waned and the new supposed service era has begun . Therefore , the middle class income median that thrived throughout the 90s will ( or already has been ) reduced to a mere pittance above minimum wage—otherwise known as , I think , global wage.Still the question remains : “ How soon will the 1 % wealthy succeed in creating a two class society , that will eventually implode in on itself ? ” You know what I think ?

Whether bearded or shaved , long hair or short , being well-groomed ( clean hair and skin , well-trimmed facial hair ) is probably the most important .

"i need to know phisical chemical properties of sodium thiocyanate ? from the link below , which includes a lot more information : Cyanic acid ( also called fulminic acid ) is an unstable ( explosive ) , poisonous , volatile , clear liquid with the structure of H-O-C=N ( the oxoacid formed from the pseudohalogen cyanide ) , which readily polymerizes to cyamelide and fulminic acid . Cyanuric acid ( also called pyrolithic acid ) , white monoclinic crystal with the structure of [ HOC ( NCOH ) 2N ] , is the compound of polymerized cyanic acid . Cyanic acid hydrolyses to ammonia and carbon dioxide in water . Its salts and esters are cyanates ( or called fulminates ) . Esters of normal cyanic acid are not known . There is another isomeric cyanic acid with the structure of H-N=C=O , which is called isocyanic acid . Its salts and esters are isocyanates . Cyanates ( or Isocyanates ) are used in the manufacturing pharmaceuticals , pesticides , textile softener , lubricants and industrial disinfectants through the conversion to polycyclic compounds ( such as hydantoins and imidazolons ) They are used as plastic additives and as heat treatment salt formulations for metals . Thiocyanate is a salt or ester of thiocyanic acid ( HSCN ) . Aqueous solutions of thiocyanic acid , also called sulfocyanic acid , are very strong acids of the equilibrium mixture of thiocyanic and isothiocyanic . Thiocyanates are bonded through the sulfur ( s ) with the structure R-S-C¡ÕN or the isomeric R-N=C=S ( isothiocyanates ) . Thiocyanates are bonded through the sulfur ( s ) which replace for the oxygen ( O ) atom . Thiocyanates are the sulfur analog of isocyanates . Organic as well as metallic thiocyanates [ CuSCN , Ca ( SCN ) 2 , NaSCN , KSCN ] are very versatile compounds . They have wide range of applications including manufacturing industrial chemicals , pharmaceuticals and pesticides . It is used in freezing solutions , fabric dyeing , electroplating , steel pickling , printing , and corrosion inhibitor against acid gases .

"Did the US government really steal Arizona , Texas and New Mexico ? What is your perception ? Any input ? As far as the story goes , Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana , president of Mexico 150 years ago , sold part of the Mexican territory ( now Arizona , Texas and New Mexico ) to the US government . Others , specially politicians , say it was stolen by the US . That all really depends on your definition of `` stole . '' Technically , the Mexican government signed the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo , ceding all of the territories to which you refer in exchange for $ 15 million and ending the Mexican-American War . One could say , however , that the Mexican-American War was merely a pretext for taking all of the territory , and it is likely not far from the truth . Also , a large chunk of Arizona and a section of New Mexico were purchased after the stealing of the rest in 1853 as the Gadsden Purchase , in which the US paid Mexico $ 10 million , about $ 343,826,098 accounting for inflation .",0

"When buying DVD Movies , what is the difference between full frame and wide screen movies ? The difference is due to something called `` aspect ratio '' . Widescreen movies have a 16:9 aspect ratio , meaning that they are more rectangular than square in the shape of the screen ( the screen is wider than regular , hence the term `` widescreen '' ) . The difference in the picture is that with widescreen , you see more on the edges of the picture . For instance , if there were 100 trees in a shot , with full frame you might only see 70 of them because the edges are cut off a bit . To me , this makes a difference in the movie , but not so much that you would have a different understanding of the film . Moving forward , I would say that you should buy your movies in 16:9 or widescreen format because more and more TV 's are now in that format .",0

"The Practice of Tithing : for today ? Is the practice of Tithing as described in the Old Testament Laws , and Malachi still to be practiced by Gentile Christians and/or Israeli Christians today , or has the new covenant practice of Giving cheerfully out of ones abundance and ability , as mentioned in II Corinthians replaced the old way ? Can a church today survive without a legalistic tenth of the congregations income , relying only on the abundant non percentage giving of those who are willing and able ? You are correct , it is unbiblical for a preacher to require members to tithe of income . Also tithing was always food never money and the tithe was always eaten by the tither . Read Deut . 12 and 14 . Can a church survive ? Yes but not as a mega church . the churches would be smaller and be more quality than quantity ( Jesus himself only had twelve apostles ) . Eliminate tithing and the pastor is forced to live by faith , not many of them want to do that though.Our church does not believe in tithing of income nor do I take an offering ( some do give anyway ) . When God decides it is time to close up then we will close up . All churches should run on faith not business tactics . The only thing most pastors have faith in is their ability to con their members out of more money.And in Malachi when it mentions will a man rob God ( preachers love that one ) no one mentions that this is written to the Levitical priests Mal 2:1 . It was the priests stealing the tithe from the tithers . It must be an honest mistake that they forgot this . lol . Malachi 3:8 ties in with I Samuel 2:12-17 .

"Is Scientology the biggest scam of all time ? In his own spiritual life , Tom Cruise has continued to climb the `` Bridge to Total Freedom , '' Scientology 's path to enlightenment . International Scientology News , a church magazine , reported last year that the actor had embarked on one of the highest levels of training , `` OT VII '' — for Operating Thetan VII.At these higher levels — and at a potential cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars — Scientologists learn Hubbard 's secret theory of human suffering , which he traces to a galactic battle waged 75 million years ago by an evil tyrant named Xenu.According to court documents made public by The Times in the 1980s , Hubbard espoused the belief that Xenu captured the souls , or thetans , of enemies and electronically implanted false concepts in them to keep them confused about his dirty work . The goal of these advanced courses is to become aware of the trauma and free of its effects . Is Scientology posing a real threat to Christian America or summink ? This is the third or fourth paranoid question about that organisation in a week ! If they 're crackpots let them carry on cracking pots .

Some Christians find the real answer to that question and carry on believing in their faith .

"Explain how spectral observations ( red shift ) have led to the theory of the big bang. ? im in 10th garde and i need a detailed answerthank you Actually Einstein predicted the Big Bang before Hubble found the first observational evidence.Einstein found that in his theory of General Relativity that the universe as a whole should be either expanding or contracting . He did n't like this so he added an extra term the `` cosmological constant '' to balance the equations and have a universe that was not expanding or contracting . That sort of static universe was what was expected in those days.Meanwhile , Edmund Hubble began making observations in the 1920s from the Mt Wilson Observatory of distant `` nebulae . '' He had discovered previosuly that many of this faint blobs , previously thought to be gas clouds , were in fact galaxies like our own Milky Way . This was a big surprise since previosuly the Milky Way was the only galaxy , or what they called at the time , an `` island universe . `` So , it was natural for Hubble to look at the spectra of some of these distant galaxies . What he found was that , except for a couple of very nearby galaxies like M-31 the Andromeda Galaxy , all the other galaxies had shifted spectra . That is , these other galaxies has spectra which were redshifted , indicating that they were moving away from us.Further he found that the fainter galaxies ( which on average are farther away ) had the largest redshifts . This lead to the famous `` Hubble 's Law '' that says that the observed redshift is proportional to the distance a galaxy is from us.Einstein found out about Hubble 's discovery and realized what it meant - the whole universe is expanding . Although naively it looks like everything is moving away from us , all of space is expanding , so that an observor in any galaxy would detect the same thing - that every galaxy is moving away from them.The usual analogy is to think of rasins in rasin bread . As the bread rises all the dough ( space ) expands , so the distance between all rasins ( galaxies ) grows . Thus from any one rasin ( galaxy ) all the rest look like they are moving away.Einstein realized that his `` cosmological constant '' was unneccessary . He famously called it his `` greatest blunder '' and that he could have officially predicted the expansion of the universe before Hubble confirmed it with observations . ( And in fact , before Hubble 's discovery , other scientists like Willem de Sitter and Alexander Friedmann used the equantions of General Relativity to calculate an expanding universe . ) At that point it was realized that if space is expanding that in the past it must have been all bunched up in one spot . Just before Hubble Georges Lemaître realized this and thought that at first there was some sort of `` primaval atom '' from which everything else came from.Fred Hoyle did n't like Lemaitre 's idea at all , not the least of which was because Lemaitre insisted that God started the whole thing . Hoyle developed a rival theory the Steady State universe , and dismissed the other type of ideas as a `` hot big bang . '' Of course Hoyle 's term , meant as a put-down , became the offical name . ( Hoyle 's Steady State Theory was a serious rival to the Big Bang until the 1960s and the discovery of the microwave background . ) It was n't until 1948 that the modern aspects of the Big Bang were proposed by George Gamow and Ralph Alpher . These guys showed that from an initial explosion of compressed everything one would get the correct mixture of hydrogen and helium and other trace elements observed in the whole universe . That is , if one starts from a hot subatomic , compressed mixture and lets it go , it will recombine into the right ratio of atoms . ( Right being the ration actually observed . ) And so it goes from there , to much more observational evidence for the Big Bang , as well as lots of theoretical progress . At the moment we know that the old cyclical idea , that the universe expands and then contracts , is wrong . In fact the universe seems to be accelerating , tha",0

"Where do babies come from ? I mean i dont understand the process ... Well ... bear with me , because I may use some off-hand phrases and different words . And in the interest of education , do n't laugh when you hear some ... familiar words.There is a process in which it is done . The mature egg in the woman 's vagina is met with the mature sperm in the man 's testicles through intercourse . This is called fertilization . As soon as the egg is fertile , it becomes known as a zygote . The zygote is then transported to the womb , an organ in the female reproduction system that can expand to the size of a basketball , if the circumstances permit it to . The egg sticks to the side of the womb and grows , multiplying in cell count , fron 1 to 2 , to 4 , to 8 , and et cetra , for the first four months , also called the first Trimester . then it is called an Embyro . for the next trimester , the embyro will assume human characteristics , like arms and legs , and the heart will start beating . For the final trimester , the baby will gain muscle mass and fatty tissue , the tissue that will protect the new baby from harmful impact and harsh weather . After the final trimester , the baby can be given birth via vaginal birth , where the baby comes through the vagina of the mother ( a process that is , indeed , very painful ) , or Cisarean section , also known as C-section , where the mother is surgically cut open to remove the baby ( do n't worry , the doctors put her back together ) . The baby is then taken to a maternity ward for 3 days , so it can get used to the air and oxygen ( 12 months in water does make for a environmental shock ! ) . Then the mother is able to take home the baby , her new son or daughter .",0

"What are the rules of the basketball game ? basketball , game played generally indoors by two opposing teams of five players each . Basketball was conceived in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith , a physical education instructor at the YMCA college in Springfield , Mass. , as a way to condition outdoor athletes during the winter months . His original list of 13 rules has undergone a century of revision , leading to faster pacing and greater athleticism . Today basketball is one of the most popular American sports and one the rest of the world has adopted.Basic RulesAt each end of the court—usually about 92 ft ( 28 m ) long and 50 ft ( 15 m ) wide—is a bottomless basket made of white cord net and suspended from a metal ring , 18 in . ( 46 cm ) in diameter , which is attached 10 ft ( 3.05 m ) above the floor ( usually hardwood ) to a backboard made of fiberglass , wood , or other material . Players may throw , dribble ( bounce ) , or shoot the basketball ( an inflated ball usually made of leather or rubber ) but may not run with it or kick it.Teams try to advance the ball and shoot it through one basket ( the ball must enter from above ) and to keep the opposition from scoring through the other . Each field goal , or basket , scores two points , or three points if shot from beyond a specified distance ( 21 ft/6 m in U.S. colleges , slightly longer in international and professional play ) . Teams must shoot the ball within a prescribed time limit ( 24 sec in the National Basketball Association ; 30 sec in international games and in most women 's play ; 45 sec in men 's collegiate play ) .Any player making illegal body contact with an opposing player is assessed a foul ; the opposing team may be given possession of the ball , or an opposing player awarded free throws at the basket from the foul line . Each made foul shot is worth one point . Players who exceed the foul limit ( usually five , but six in the NBA ) are disqualified from the game . International and collegiate basketball games have two 20-min halves , professionals play four 12-min quarters , and high schoolers play four 8-min quarters .",0

"Will we ever evolve to Homo sapiens futuria as it has been predicted ? Is nature that predictable I would have to disagree with David to some extent . To evolve into a different species we would have changed enough so that different subpopulations of humans could no longer interbreed . Humans display a range of social and technological aptitudes and capacities throughout earth , the majority of which have n't even heard a dialtone let alone participated in any form of advanced travel or communications processes . However , none of these people are incabable of doing so if provided with the appropriate education needed . This suggest that there has n't been any change in our molecular ( genetic ) makeup that provides us with these advanced technologies -- which is where the changes are needed to happen for biological evolution to occur . Even if you wanted to argue that social evolution has distinguished industrialized man from our primitive brethern enough to warrant a new species distinction , I would argue that we still have n't met one of the key requirements for doing so , there are no subgroups of humans on earth that are incapable of interbreeding with one another . Until that happens , no we have n't evolved from Homo sapiens sapiens to Homo sapiens futura . However , we will evolve into someting different ! This is a certainty -- as long as our species does n't become extint before that can happen ! But do n't expect that Homo sapiens will evolve into just one different species . Depending on what our environment ( s ) dictates , humans could evolve into numerous other species . Through the process of evolution , it is inevitable , but at the same time it is not predictable .",0

"can blocked nose cause headcahe , if yes why ? ? i dont know what type of headacahe it is , its not pain , but stiff head , like my head is knottted with robe and this also cause blocked nose and buzz in ears ? ? what do u say about it ... ManyThanks ... Cheers ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Sohail Gagaigagai @ hotmail.com Yeah , that definitely sounds like a sinus headache . Nose blockage can definitely cause headaches . I get sinus headaches from time to time , and Tylenol Sinus works everytime . So does using ice against your forehead . A third remedy is to take dry ginger powderand mix it with water and apply on your forehead ... works like a charm.You 're probably coming down with some sort of ENT infection , since you have a blocked nose and buzzing ears . I 'd say go to the doctor before it gets worse ! Hope you feel better soon ^_^",0

"do you think us gov is going correct ? noooooooooo ! ! ! ! they are always arrogant and think they are superior to others By `` us gov '' I assume you mean the current administration . Or do you mean to include congress ? In either case , the answer is generally , no . I 'm terribly disappointed . Or rather , not really disappointed , because I did not expect much from GWB . But the structure of our government is still pretty good , and our Constitution is just fine , thank you . Do n't you wish the current crop of idiots paid attention to it once in awhile ? The problem I see in this country is that the vast majority of voters figure their choices are limited to the two largest parties . Problem is , they have been trading off power trips and making back-room deals between them for so long , that does not give us much in the way of a choice.But we have a strong and promising third party coming up fast : the Libertarian Party . We libertarians believe that a government should be small enough to fit inside the Constitution . We would disassemble the beaurocracy , stop butting into other countries ' business , and trust the individual adult citizen to make his or her own choices about private matters . We believe market forces would solve many of the problems that protectionism and favoritism only make worse . And we believe that taxes should be eliminated if possible , or at least reduced to no more than it would take to run those operations that can not be accomplished any other way . If the state can do it , then the feds should let them . If the county can do it , the state should let them . If the individual can do it , then let him alone . If the individual can not do it , let voluntary organizations and other structures at the local level help . Because the larger the unit set with the task of solving a given problem , the less efficient it will inevitably be . Perhaps the coordination necessary for defense operations would require a federal structure , but I personally can not think of anything else that needs to be done on such a scale . Can you ?",0

"What exactly is a black hole ? A blackhole is a collection of matter with gravity so immense that nothing can escape how strong the pull of it is unless when you are in it 's pull you can accelerate faster than the speed of light and beyond , thus the blackhole swallows up light as well.What happens is large masses collapse under their own weight . Think of a house of cards . The more you pile on , the greater the weight becomes until the cards on the bottom ca n't take the weight anymore . When the house of cards falls , the cards still exist but have lost their structure do to gravity.Now instead of a house of cards , replace that with an enormous sun that has tons of matter inside . The sun is teetering on the brink of collapsing as the matter inside grows and grows until eventually , like the house of cards , it falls down . Except since this is a sphere in space is is being pulled inward by it 's onw gravity , and not down like earth gravity , the sun does n't fall down , it falls IN.When this does happen the gravity does n't stop existing because the matter does n't either , it becomes smaller and the gravity grows as it pulls larger and larger amounts of matter into it 's core . Eventually it because so dense and so massive and so small that the gravity involved will not allow even Photons , or light particles , the fastest thing in the universe to pass through it.There ya have it !",0

Even in dark , cool conditions , fluorine reacts explosively with hydrogen . - > It is so reactive that glass , metals , and even water , as well as other substances , burn with a bright flame in a jet of fluorine gas . - > It is far too reactive to be found in elemental form and has such an affinity for most elements , including silicon , that it can neither be prepared nor should be kept in glass vessels . In moist air it reacts with water to form the equally dangerous hydrofluoric acid.- > In aqueous solution , fluorine commonly occurs as the fluoride ion F- . Other forms are fluoro-complexes ( such as [ FeF4 ] - ) or H2F+.- > Fluorides are compounds that combine fluoride with some positively charged counterpart . They often consist of ions .

"is yahoo better or google ? My answer is google for the following reasons : Pros of Google : As a seach engine , google has the best relevance and presents the results in a way that I find easy to decide what pages are best for me . Its the best in terms of researching information.For makin money , a # 1 on google is worth many times more than a # 1 on yahoo . Yahoo ! blocks the top of the SERPs with sponsored ads.Google also has a neat interface . Yahoo is not bad too , but its interface is not that neat . The reason for that being it to be a portal . I think a nice interface is very important since people will come back more often if so.The relevance of search results make its 'Feeling Lucky ' feature pretty useful . Firefox address bar by defaults goes to 1 site listed on your search results.Google has tried to stay away from Spam/ misleading sites better than other search engines.Cons of Google : However , few problems with google , its web crawler dose n't capture hyperlinks from PDF files stored on net , a feature which Yahoo provides.Also , Google at present does not provide an index for video aggregation through the web crawler , a feature which Altavista provided since 1999 . The problems include accuracy of the media file . That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.Due to a larger share of 'searching ' community , Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs . Because most bloggers mention the word failure with President Bush 's name , the # 1 site on searching Failure is the website of President Bush.Yahoo is doing pretty good research in Search Technologies , for example Grokker.http : //www.grokker.com/grokker.html ? query=Anirudh % 20Koul & Yahoo=true & Daypop=true & numResults=250",0

how does a flourescent lamp gives us light ? 1.First of all it is cheaper then the standard lightbulb . I use it all the time instead of the standard filament bulbs that use the wire to heat up . 2 . It uses your power ( electricity ) to move Mercury vapor in argon or neon.3 . Did you know that that type of light does not stay on steady ? It makes many many blinks too fast for your eye to catch . I tried experimenting with using a `` fan '' . Only way to fully see the blinks very well is when it is reaching end of its life.4 . A modified version you could use to grow plants . But it is not your standard `` flourescent '' light.You could try ( likely ) to check howstuffworks because if I would explain would run out of space.Word of caution as always : Never attempt to open one flourescent up it will explode . It will release Gas and could be more dangerous if you break it near yourself then a standard bulb ! I LOVE IT we have brains on Q /A today ! Now that could be used on the message boards too .,0

"Best way to get into Voice Over work ? Where in the name of heaven do I find job postings for voice over work ? It seems to be a very insular community . Is the only `` in '' through taking high-priced classes ? Maybe I do n't know the best way , but my father is a Voice Actor , and is very successful . He offers great work shops in the L.A. area and often takes serious aspiring voice actors under his wing . I 've noticed that in his field there are some tricks . 1 . Of course you have to have a good agent . He works with a well known agency . 2 . You have to understand the trends of the business . When I was younger , he worked on a lot of cartoons like Duck Tales , Gummi Bears , Bearnstien Bears , Snorks , and a bunch of other ones . But these days , the younger voices seem to be a trend . He has had to tailor his work in a new way to get into the right realm of voice acting again . Good thing he has a great agent . 3 . This is the most important in my opinion . You have to be honest and HARD WORKING . I noticed that a lot of people in entertainment are ego-centric . They wo n't take a job unless it has a great image attached to it . When my father got his job , he took any and every job he could get . The side product was that he became extremely good at it . He has more practice than anybody , and he now bears the nick-name `` one-take Brian '' to most of his collegues in Hollywood . So when a commercial is done and they need to lay the VO tracks on the video ... he 's the man they call in crunch time because they know he 'll get it done fast . He saves sound engineers money on reduced studio time too . So I guess hard work and integrity pay off in a business where there 's a lot of less honest and less hard working people . It 's a great business and he loves it . It 's very lucrative for him too . However , I 've seen a lot of people fail at it . Get out there.. make demos , get your name known , practice your trade , and take what you can get . I hope it works out . If you live in the L.A. area and are interested in a good contact or his workshops , contact me . He has a good repetoire of well known roles and he knows most of the famous Voice Actors out there from Jim Cummings to Gary Owens .",0

It is not necessarily a position where the person says affirmatively that God does not exist . Atheist is a general statement about a non belief in any God concept.Hard Atheist : This is the person who says that God does not exist , affirmatively.Weak Atheist : This is a person who does not feel that there is any quality evidence for the existence of God .

It took ten years for my poor poor heart to mend after I divorced my husband of 13 years b/c he had a baby with an aquaitance of mine and I felt sorry for her not being married and all gave her a baby shower and gave her all my childs things ( i did not know it was his child til later ) . It just takes time . I dove into my work and made new friends ( seeing as how all my old friends knew it was his child and did not tell me ) and spent some quality time with myself . I got to know me really well and decided I really liked the new me . Just give yourself time to heal and get involved with work and friends . It does help . Oh and try not to drown your sorrows in alchol and drugs . I tried that I lost everything I had AGAIN and had to start over .

"What is a Rife Generator and how does it work ? I 'll post here my answer that I gave when another person asked the same question a month or so ago.The Rife machine is legit depending on what model or manufacturer you got it from . There was a company in the late 80 's to early 90 's called LER that made what they named the REM SuperPro Generator . Though I ca n't vouch for any of the newer models , I can say that Rife 's technology was right on if you can find an original model.YES it shattered cancer cells , YES he was heralded as having found the cure for all diseases , YES he had 100 % success rate on the patients in the Pasadena county hospital . A Rife machine uses scalar waves , along the now established fact that every organism operates at its own distinct frequency . By increasing the resonance , a particular organism can be destroyed without harming the tissue around it . Rife meticulousy recorded the M.O.R . ( mortal oscillatory rate ) for the thousands of micro-organisms he could see under his universal microscope . A properly built Rife frequency generator can not hurt , except for a brief healing crisis , followed by an incredible feeling of health and well-being taken from years of testimonials ( unless you have a pacemaker from what I 've heard ) . A good amount of reading on Rife 's story can be found at some of the links below.Unfortunately most of his work was destroyed because of the newly created AMA and FDA that came into power . They ruled Rife 's work did not fall under their now established guidelines for medical practice , and with the government to back them up , it was the end for his discovery .",0

"lemon juice is a preservative , no ? so if i put some on a curry and put it in the fridge will it last longer ? Food is perserved by controlling the acidity ( by adding acids ) , or by controlling the water activity ( by removing the amount of water available to microbes through cooking out water , or by adding salts ) . By adding lemon juice , you can significantly lower the pH , which would make it difficult for some microbes to live ( or to readily take over ) . However , to make the curry last , you may have to add so much lemon juice as to make the curry unpaletable . Lowering the pH will get rid of some microbes , but not others .

"someone tell me inlaymans terms , why it is impossible for physical objects to travel at the speed of light ? Here are two explanations ( neither particularly satisfying I will tell you in advance . ) The first is that the speed of light ( in a vaccuum ) is a property of the universe that is measured the same by everyone , regardless of their motion relative to anyone else . This is a true statement born out by experiment , but it implies some very weird stuff . One is that distance and time are not measured the same by people in relative motion . Another is that you can never get closer to a beam of light going away from you ( i.e . go faster than the speed of light ) . If you could , you would measure the speed of light differently than someone else , and you would be special . The basic idea behind relativity is that , with regard to the laws of physics , no one is special . The second unsatisfying answer is E=mc^2 . In order to go faster , you have to accelerate . Acceleration takes energy , and an accelerating body has more mass than a body in a constant state of motion ( increase E in that equation m has go up , because c is the constant speed of light ) . It just so happens that the mass does n't go up in proportion to the rate of acceleration , but in relationship to how close you are to the speed of light . Everytime you halve the distance between your speed and the speed of light , your mass doubles , and the amount of effort needed to get that next bit of acceleration doubles . Getting to the speed of light would require infinite energy .",0

"information about light ? Light , form of electromagnetic radiation similar to radiant heat , radio waves , and X rays . Light consists of extremely fast oscillations of an electromagnetic field in a particular range of frequencies that can be detected by the human eye . Different colour sensations are produced by light vibrating at different frequencies , ranging from about 4 × 1014 vibrations per second for red light to about 7.5 × 1014 vibrations per second for violet light . The visible spectrum of light is usually defined by its wavelength , ranging from the smallest visible wavelength for violet , about 40 millionths of a centimetre ( 16 millionths of an inch ) , to 75 millionths of a centimetre ( about 30 millionths of an inch ) for red . Higher frequencies , corresponding to shorter wavelengths , comprise ultraviolet radiation , and still higher frequencies are associated with X-rays . Lower frequencies , which are at longer wavelengths , are called infrared radiation , and still lower frequencies are characteristic of radio waves . Most light comes from electrons that vibrate at these high frequencies when heated to a high temperature . The higher the temperature , the greater the frequency of vibration and the bluer the light produced.Light is emitted from a source in straight lines and spreads out over a larger and larger area as it travels ; the light per unit area diminishes as the square of the distance . When light strikes an object , it is either absorbed or reflected ; light reflected from a rough surface is scattered in all directions . Some frequencies are reflected more strongly than others , and this gives objects their characteristic colour . White surfaces scatter light of all wavelengths equally , and black surfaces absorb nearly all light . Image-forming reflection , on the other hand , requires a highly polished surface such as that of a mirror.Defining the nature of light has always been a fundamental problem in physics . The English mathematician and physicist Sir Isaac Newton described light as an emission of particles , and the Dutch astronomer , mathematician , and physicist Christiaan Huygens developed the theory that light travels by a wave motion.It is now believed that these two theories are essentially complementary , and the development of quantum theory has led to the recognition that in some experiments light acts like a series of particles and in other experiments it acts like a wave . In those situations in which it travels in wave motion , the wave vibrates at right angles to the direction of travel ; therefore light can be polarized in two mutually perpendicular planes ( see Optics ) .III VELOCITY The speed of light was first measured in a laboratory experiment by the French physicist Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau , although earlier astronomical observations had yielded approximately the right velocity . By the 1970s the speed of light had been measured very precisely as 299,792,458 m/sec ( 186,282.397 mi/sec ) in a vacuum , and could be used to measure large distances by the time it took for a pulse of light or radio waves to reach a target and return . This is the principle of radar and sonar . Accurate knowledge of the speed and the wavelength of light also permits accurate measurement of length . In fact , in 1983 the metre was redefined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second . The velocity of light in air varies slightly with wavelength , averaging about 3 per cent less than in vacuum ; the speed in water is about 25 per cent less , and in glass , 33 per cent less.Light has an important effect on many chemicals . Sunlight , for example , is used by plants to carry out photosynthesis , and the exposure of certain silver-containing chemicals to light causes them to turn dark in the presence of other chemicals , as is the case in photography .",0

"Do men and women see things differently ? The short answer is 'yes ' unless you are referring to sight.The right and left hemispheres of the human brain are connected by a huge nerve bundle called the corpus callosum . In the male fetus when male hormones are generated the corpus callosum shrinks reducing cross-communication . Because the left hemisphere deals with logic and the right hemisphere deals with emotion , women connect all logic better with emotion than men do . Although a man can chose , he is always either logical or emotional but rarely both at the same time . A man either flies off the handle or thinks the problem through . A woman can weep or laugh when she discovers something that makes sense . This explains why women are better at nurturing ( cranky ) children and men are better at hunting for bears ( or a six pack ) . Of course men can care for their children and women can hunt bare ; I mean bear .",0

However , if someone repeats crime over and over again his conciouseness get used to it more and more so he/she lives pretty good with stealing. -- Also , ( it is not excuse though ) , people can steal for a different purposes ... self-preservation most powerful probably ... 2 ) -- Second question I do n't uderstand .

In his youth he sought out many of India 's Hindu sages and saints , hoping to find an illumined teacher to guide him in his spiritual quest.Yogananda met his guru , Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri , in 1910 , at the age of 17 . After passing his Intermediate Examination in Arts from the Scottish Church College , Calcutta , he did his graduation in religious studies from the Serampore College , a constituent college of the University of Calcutta .",0

"How do I get rid of `` Love Handles '' ? I ended up with big love handles after having my son . I would look so much smaller if they matched the rest of my body . My pants fit at the waist , but I always have 2 pudgy blobs hangin ' over the back of my pants . Is there a miricle diet that targets that area ? j/k or An exercize that can take care of them ? The only way to reduce love handles is to reduce your overall body fat level . Unfortunately many people have certain limited areas where fat tends to deposit first and go away last . There is nothing you can do about this . It is controlled by genetics and may change with age . You may be able to make it look beter by developing the underlying muscles . A good all round weight training program coupled with a reasonable diet is the best plan . Another exercise that affect the underlying muscles are hanging , twisting knee or leg raises . I 'd recommend doing ses of high reps ( 50-100 or more ) .",0

"What is a PIC ( ? ) tube or insert ? My brother starts Chemo & radiation next week and they set up his feeding tube for when he needs it down the line . PIC stands for percutaneous intravenous catheter . Sometimes it is necessary to receive medicine or other fluids intravenously ( in the vein ) . If it is needed for a long period of time , the doctor might consider a PIC line as the best option . PIC lines are long , flexible tubes inserted into a large vein , usually near the elbow . The tube ( medically speaking , all tubes are called catheters ) is threaded up the vein until its tip reaches the large veins inside the chest.A PIC line can remain in place for several weeks or more . They are especially helpful for patients who need to receive medication at home for a long time . It is not uncomfortable . Most people have no trouble with them , and they can remain quite active while having one in place . PIC lines have bandages which are placed over the insertion site to make sure it does n't get accidentally tugged . This bandage has to be changed every day or two . A PIC line can be used for several kinds of injections , therefore , the patient does not have to be poked so many times .",0

"What is gravity ? A simple answer : it is the force exerted by two bits of matter on each other , pulling them towards each other . The size of the force is F=G*M*m/r^2 , where M is the mass of one object , m is the mass of the other , r is how far apart they are , and G is the universal gravitational constant.Einstein described gravity as a `` well '' created by mass -- a deformation of the shape of the universe that changed how particles moved like the bumps and valleys in a miniature golf course change the movement of your golf ball.At another level , gravity is one of the four basic forces in nature ; it 's the one that , at the moment , is probably best described and perhaps least understood .

"Are there any tried and true ways to stop psoriasis flare ups ? Keep your skin moist and lubricated . Avoid cold , dry climates . Cold weather may worsen symptoms , while hot , humid weather and sunlight may improve symptoms . ( However , hot humid weather may worsen certain types of psoriasis . ) Avoid scratching and picking skin and skin injuries ( cuts or scrapes ) . An injury to the skin can cause psoriasis patches to form anywhere on the body , including the site of the injury . This includes injuries to your nails or nearby skin while trimming your nails . Avoid stress and anxiety . Stress may cause psoriasis to appear suddenly ( flare ) or can make symptoms worse , although this has not been proven in studies . Avoid infection . Infections such as strep throat can cause psoriasis to appear suddenly ( called guttate psoriasis ) , especially in children . Try to avoid certain medications . Some , including beta-blockers and lithium , have been found to worsen psoriasis symptoms . Tell your doctor you have psoriasis before any medications are prescribed for you . Limit alcohol . This may help control psoriasis , especially for men .",0

"can antigravity be achieved ? Anti-gravity in the context of mainstream physicsNewton 's Law of Gravitation considered gravity to be a force between two objects , causing attraction in proportion to the objects ' mass . Under this interpretation , an object with negative mass would repel ordinary matter , and could be used to produce an anti-gravity effect . Alternatively , depending on the mechanism assumed to underlie the gravitational force , it may seem reasonable to postulate a material that shields against gravity or otherwise interferes with the force . An example of such a material , cavorite , is a major deus ex machina of H. G. Wells ' famous book , The First Men in the Moon , though it should be noted that Cavorite is n't consistent with even a Newtonian view of the universe ( it causes violations of conservation laws ) . Neither negative-mass exotic matter nor a gravity-screening material have been observed experimentally . While the potential existence of exotic matter is still debated , general relativity presents persuasive arguments against the existence of screening materials . Einstein 's theory of general relativity , published in 1915 , supplanted Newton 's model of gravity with an entirely different mechanism - one based entirely on the geometry of the universe . Gravity was no longer a force at all , but simply the consequence of the local slope of the universe in a direction the human eye can not see : time . You stick to the floor not because gravity is pulling you down , but because that is the shortest distance between today and tomorrow . Under this model , gravity in a universe containing only matter with positive mass is purely attractive . No arrangement of ordinary matter can produce an anti-gravity effect . Spacetime geometries corresponding to true anti-gravity in general relativity require negative mass . Some models of anti-gravity claim to derive from general relativity.The model of gravity proposed by the theory of general relativity breaks down under extreme conditions ( too far inside a black hole , and in the very early life of the universe under the big bang model ) . In particular , most physicists believe that at extremely high energies , gravity and the other fundamental forces unify , which would allow gravity to be manipulated in ways that are not readily apparent now . Candidate models for this regime are theories of everything , which attempt to model all four forces ( example : string theory ) , and theories of quantum gravity , which attempt to produce a model of gravity that is consistent with quantum mechanics , though not necessarily unified with the other forces . Some models of anti-gravity claim to be based on quantum gravity models , though the connection of these to mainstream quantum gravity models is often tenuous.Conventional effects that look like anti-gravityMagnetic levitation suspends an object against gravity by use of electromagnetic effects . While visually impressive , this is not an anti-gravity effect . Critics of various alleged anti-gravity devices often suggest that unusual effects observed around them are due to electromagnetism.A tidal force causes objects to move along diverging paths near a massive body ( such as a planet or star ) , producing effects that seem like repulsion or disruptive forces when observed locally . This is not anti-gravity . In Newtonian mechanics , the tidal force is the effect of the larger object 's gravitational force being different at the differing locations of the diverging bodies . In Einsteinian gravity , the tidal force is the effect of the diverging bodies following different paths in the negatively curved spacetime around the larger body . Large amounts of normal matter can be used to produce a gravitational field that compensates for the effects of another gravitational field , though the entire assembly will still be attracted to the source of the larger field . Physicist Robert L. Forward proposed using lumps of degenerate matter to locally compensate for th",0

"What is the church of scientology ? Literally , Scientology means the study of truth . Scientologists believe that man is an immortal spiritual being whose experiences extend far beyond just this lifetime . According to Scientology , man 's capabilities are unlimited , even if they are not presently realized.Scientologists believe that painful memories from our past can hinder our ability to realize our limitless potential . For this , Scientologists offer auditing which enables people to remove the painful effects of these bad memories . Practically , auditing is a type of counseling using a lie detetector called an E-meter . In auditing , the auditor never invalidates what the pre-clear says . The ultimate aim of auditing is so people can attain the state of `` Clear , '' or a state of freedom from painful past memories . Clears are free from psychosomoatic illnesses , self determined , vigorous and persistent.Scientology 's aims are a civilization without insanity , without criminals and without wars . Where the able can prosper , where honest beings can have rights and where man is free to rise to greater heights.For this purpose , Scientologists run many humanitarian organizations including Narconon and Criminon , helping people get off drugs , the Citizens Commission on Human Rights , which fights psychiatric abuse , the Applied Scholastics educational system and the Way to Happiness Foundation .",0

"compare Sabine 's equation with Eyring and Millinton-Sette 's equation ? All of these people worked on models to aid in acoustical design of ampitheatres ( or any space where clearly hearing sound is important ) . The three equations that you listed all take the same general form , and the latter two are subsequent improvements in Sabine 's original work. '' W.C . Sabine carried out a considerable amount of research in this area and arrived at an empirical relationship between the volume of an auditorium , the amount of absorptive material within it and a quantity which he called the Reverberation Time ( RT ) . As defined by Sabine , the RT is the time taken for a continuous sound within a room to decay by 60 dB after being abruptly switched off and is given by : RT = ( 0.161V ) / Awhere V is the volume of the enclosure ( m³ ) and A is the total absorption within the enclosure ( sabine ) . `` `` Several different approaches have been used to derive equations which give values of reverberation time in better agreement with measured results from less reverberant rooms . One of these , the Norris-Eyring formula , assumes an intermittent decay with the arrival of fewer and fewer reflections . This gives the following formula : '' RT = ( 0.161V ) / ( -S ln ( 1-a ) ) '' where S is the total surface area ( m² ) and a becomes the average absorption coefficient . `` `` When the materials of a room have a wide variety of absorption coefficients , the best predictions are obtained by the Millington-Sette equation . This is simply a matter of substituting an effective absorption coefficient ae = -ln ( 1-ai ) into Sabine 's equation to give : '' RT = ( 0.161V ) / ( sum ( -Si ln ( 1-Ai ) ) where Si is the surface area of the ith material , and Ai is its actual absorption coefficient .",0

"Which religion preaches most hatred & violence ? please Be honest and speak out even if it is ur own religion. ? All religions resort to hatred and violence . It just happens that Islam is the one doing it now . Christianity used to be the evil one , killing people who did n't `` believe '' for political reasons , invading the `` holy land '' for power grabs . Even today , Christianity still uses hatred for its unifying effect , labelling gays as evil , vile sinners - any religion gets stronger when it devises a common enemy . Religion is simply a way to control people , so violence and hatred go hand in hand with this - if you want to strengthen your hold on people , give them a common enemy - then they 'll do anything you ask . Works for Islam , works for Christianity .",0
"Pope Benedict 's stance on the Charasmatic Renewal ? What is Pope Benedicts stance on the Charasmatic Renewal of the Catholic Church . I recieved the Holy Ghost , with tongues , in Catholicism.I was under the impression then that Pope John Paul II had a favorable attitude towards it , but what about the current Pope Benedics ? I think that Pope Benedict is in support of this movement in general , though he , like others in the Catholic hierarchy , has some concerns about it . He seems to support the movement , but reminds members to stay connected to the whole Church . The quotation below is from before he was elected Pope . For his part , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , has added his voice to the Pope 's in acknowledging the good occurring in the Charismatic Renewal and providing some cautions . In a forward to a book by Cardinal Suenens , at that time the Pope 's delegate to the Charismatic Renewal , the Prefect comments on the Post-Conciliar period stating , '' At the heart of a world imbued with a rationalistic skepticism , a new experience of the Holy Spirit suddenly burst forth . And , since then , that experience has assumed a breadth of a worldwide Renewal movement . What the New Testament tells us about the charisms - which were seen as visible signs of the coming of the Spirit - is not just ancient history , over and done with , for it is once again becoming extremely topical . `` Speaking of the book 's subject , renewal and the powers of darkness , he says , '' What is the relation between personal experience and the common faith of the Church ? Both factors are important : a dogmatic faith unsupported by personal experience remains empty ; mere personal experience unrelated to the faith of the Church remains blind . `` Finally , he urges those who read the book to pay special attention to the author 's double plea , '' ... to those responsible for the ecclesiastical ministry - from parish priests to bishops - not to let the Renewal pass them by but to welcome it fully ; and on the other ( hand ) ... to the members of the Renewal to cherish and maintain their link with the whole Church and with the charisms of their pastors . `` [ Renewal and the Powers of Darkness , Leo Cardinal Suenens ( Ann Arbor : Servant Books , 1983 ) ]",0

"What is Cancer ? Development of cancer , Types of treatment , effects of cancer Cancer is a disease of cells . It is an abnormal growth of cells which tend to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and , in some cases , to metastasize ( spread ) . Cancer is also called malignancy . A cancerous growth or tumor is sometimes referred to as a malignant growth or tumor . A non-malignant growth or tumor is referred to as benign . Benign tumors are not cancer . Cancer is not one disease . It is a group of more than 100 different and distinctive diseases . Cancer is NOT contagious.Cancer can involve any tissue of the body and have many different forms in each body area . Most cancers are named for the type of cell or organ in which they start . If a cancer spreads ( metastasizes ) , the new tumor bears the same name as the original ( primary ) tumor . The frequency of a particular cancer may depend on gender . While skin cancer is the most common type of malignancy for both men and women , the second most common type in men is prostate cancer and in women , breast cancer . Cancer frequency does not equate to cancer mortality . Skin cancers are often curable . Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer for both men and women in the United States today.Cancer is the Latin word for crab . The ancients used the word to mean a malignancy , doubtless because of the crab-like tenacity a malignant tumor sometimes seems to show in grasping the tissues it invades . Cancer may also be called malignancy , a malignant tumor , or a neoplasm ( literally , a new growth ) .TreatmentDevelopments in the treatment of cancer have led to greatly improved survival and quality of life for cancer patients in the past three decades . Traditionally , cancer has been treated by surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation therapy . In recent years immunotherapy has been added to that list . New drugs and techniques are constantly being researched and developed , such as antiangiogenic agents ( e.g. , angiostatin and endostatin ) , genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies , retinoid agents , and vaccine agents ( stimulating the immune system ) .",0

"This is question for science lovers ? If you dig a hole right through the earth along its diameter & drop a ball in the hole , what will be the motion shown by the ball ? This could not be done on earth because of its liquid core , but perhaps it could be done on the solid moon.At the surface of the earth , a ball ( let 's say of lead ) would have a potential energy ( PE - energy of position ) relative to the center of gravity at the center of the earth . As the ball is released into the theoretical hole , it would accelerate ( like dropping it into a well ) and some of the PE would be converted to kinetic energy ( KE - energy of motion ) . Because energy can neither be created nor destroyed , as the ball drops its speed increases and it has more KE but less PE . The ball will continue to accelerate until it reaches the center of the earth but with less attraction from the earth 's gravitational field because more and more of the earth 's mass is now above ( or behind ) it . At the very center of the earth the ball would have maximum KE but minimum PE . Passing the center the process is reversed and the ball slows as it reaches the other side of the earth 's surface , all the while reconverting KE to PE . At the opposite surface the ball would have maximum PE ( equal to the original PE but of opposite sign ( say - instead of + ) .The process could repeat forever if there is no wind resistance ( perfect vacuum - like on the moon ) and the hole was perfectly smooth exerting no friction as the earth spins on its axis constantly touching the ball to the sides of the hole.Of course this must be a mental exercise ; but it is an interesting demonstration of physics and energy conversion in particular . Good luck .",0
"whats a quik way to lose fat ? ? in a pretty simple workout ? It was n't quick to put on fat and it wo n't be quick to lose it . It 's best to lose 1 - 2 pounds per week .

Muscle burns fat even when you are n't doing anything , so you want muscle.A simple cardio workout is walking or running . You do n't need any special equipment except for a good pair of sneakers . If you have n't run before , start with walking , and progress slowly with running intervals until you can run for 30 minutes straight.A simple resistance workout can include pushups , tricep dips , crunches , squats , and lunges . If you have or buy dumbells , you can also do bicep curls , chest presses , rowing , etc .",0

"How deep can a scuba diver descend before encountering a dangerous level of pressure ? Is there a way this is calculated ? If so , how ? The main dangers a suba diver are subjected to dealing with depth are not just because of pressure , but because of the pressure of Nitrogen or Oxygen in the lungs.Too much nitrogen forced into the blood causes nitrogen narcosis , which is like being drugged by a narcotic . How deep you go depends on how the percentage of nitrogen in your air and how long you are down.Too mush Oxygen forced into the blood is toxic , and can directly cause brain damage or death . Again , how deep you go depends on the percentage of oxygen in the tank and how long you are going to be down.http : //www.scubadiving.com/training/specialty_and_advanced/what % 27s_in_your_tank % 3f/Finally , the more air that gets dissolved in you blood , the more at risk you are of having the air boil out of your blood as you come back to the surface ( this is called the bends ) and is also very dangerous . SCUBA diver have tables or dive computers that let them know , based on how deep they have been and for how long , whether they are at risk of getting the bends and if so , how slowly they need to come up in order to let the gases gradually go back out of the blood and into the lungs.With helium and ( small amount of ) oxygen in a tank , Mark Ellyatt dived to 313 m ( 1025 feet ) . http : //www.inspired-training.com/depth_record.htmThe depth limit for a Los Angeles class nuclear submarine is only 950 feet.http : //www.navsource.org/archives/08/08688.htm",0

"Receiving child support from someone on public assistance ? My husband has custody of his daughter and his daughter 's mother ( who does not see her anymore -- it 's been almost 10 months now ) is on public assistance and disability ( because of having bi-polar disorder , I guess ) . He wants to file for support because when HE did not have custody he paid his support faithfully . And he feels she needs to support her kid too . But he is curious if he will GET any support . I was told they would just subtract the support amount from the assistance amount and send the custodial parent the difference . But it would be nice to see if anyone else has had this experience before he files and takes time off work to do it . As long as there is not a medical condition preventing her from working she will be required to pay child support . The child support can be deducted out of her pay check .

"what are the effects of the emergence of overseas filipino workers to the economy of the philippines ? One can certainly write a book about this topic , but here are a few consequences stemming from the increasing numbers of overseas Filipino workers , of OFWs.Sociological : many observers have noticed changes in the traditional family structure ; as a substantial portion of OFWs are women , they often work abroad to send money home to put their children through school ; thus , children often live in single parent households where the primary breadwinner is absent and gender roles are reversed , i.e . the mother is the breadwinner , while the father takes on the role of homemaker.Economic : overseas remittances are important in keeping the Philippines ' balance of payments in surplus ; as such , this preserves the level of reserve assets held by the Philippines , thus contributing to debt sustainability ( the country is one of the largest issuers of sovereign debt in the developing world ) and propping up the exchange rate ( thanks in part to the large inflow of overseas remittances from OFWs , the Philippine peso was one of the strongest performers vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar in 2005 ) .Political : given their increased importance in the economy , OFWs have rightly gained increased influence as a political constituency -- up until 2004 , overseas Filipinos were denied the right to vote ; because of their large numbers -- some estimates go as high as 8 million -- their vote could potentially swing an election ; however , as evidenced by the low turnout by eligible overseas Filipino voters in 2004 , huge logistics problems need to be tackled to fulfill that potential .",0

The sun is really yellow and if you were on a planet far far away and looked at our sun , depending on how far you really are ( faint stars are hard to make out period ) , you 'd see a star with a yellowish tinge.You can go out on your backyard on a clear night and see stars of various colors.Capella is a bright yellow star in Auriga , Betelgeuse is a red star in Orion , etc.Stars come in various colors : white , red , blue , yellow.You can mainly tell how hot a star is by its color : I believe the order is blue ( hottest ) , white , yellow , red ( coolest ) .Light is radiation , things at different temperatures radiate different wavelengths of light . You can see this in real life : A candle flame is yellow , but a blowtorch , which is much hotter , is blue.Color also gives astronomers an indication of how old the star is : Stars cool down as they age , so a red star would be very old and on its way to dyinng ( Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star , on its way out ) , while white and blue stars are more recently formed",0

"What is the law on assault on minors in Virginia ? I have a 17 yr old boy and his 14 yr old girlfreind harrsing us . It 's the same as everywhere ; you or your b/f hurt her , you go to jail unless it 's self defense and you 'd better be able to prove it . I 'm a former police officer and if you attacked her , I would arrest you . What you need to do is to talk to the girl 's parents . She sounds obsessive and that can be dangerous . You need to document every offense , possibly video tape her doing it or recording her with a hidden tape recorder , which , in Texas , you can legally do as long as one party in the conversation is aware that it 's being taped , i.e . you or your boyfriend talking to her . If she shows up at your home , call the police . If her parents refuse to put a stop to it , go to the school principal if you are all in the same school and if need be , the police but do not lay a hand on her unless she attacks you . Where do you think sympathy might lie in a court of law ? With you and your b/f who are older , or what they would consider a child misbehaving ? Right or wrong , sympathy will be on her side because of her age . You both have to be the mature ones in this case . Do n't try to solve it on your own . Do tell her when you speak to her that you are going to call the police or go to her parents and if that does n't work , do as I instructed . It 's the safesty way for anyone .

"What diet plans that you know of , really work ? Honestly. ? All diets may work temporarilly . Some of them though may leave you malnourished and fatigued . No diet where you eliminate a certain food group or an entire group of foods based on carb intake is good for your body . Drink lots of water , cut out soda . Get rid of the salty , sugary snacks . Eat until you are full of healthy foods . Eat slowly so you will feel your stomach get full . Excercise . If nothing else just go for a walk . Cardio is the best , jogging , jumping jacks ... . Consistency is key . You cant expect pounds to melt off in a matter of weeks that took a lifetime of bad habits to put on . You have to burn fat off . Eat small meals throughout the day to reduce temptation to overeat . If you want a snack have healthy snacks available ... Homeade granola ( the storebought kind is usually LOADED with sugar and salt ) , veggies and dip.. whole wheat crackers with cream cheese and peanut butter ... Eat yogurt . Try tofu . Eat lots of fruit . You dont have to starve yourself just eat right and excercise .",0
"american culture values ? Interesting question . If you refer to an identity for american culture , my guess is that identity comes from multiculturalism , the meeting point of various cultures and cultural values and cultural viewpoints . America ( both as a continent and as the US of A ) is home to so many nationalities that one might get lost in trying to find what American culture is about or what being an american really is.So my opinion is that multi ( or pluriculturalism , not sure which is best used ) is the identifier here . At least it should be , because an environment which harbors such diversity should promote understanding , empathy and coexistance for those cultures which are part of it , something that the USA declares itself to be upholding , but its internal and external policies seem to disagree .",0

"what is day saving time ? Daylight Saving Time ( or Summer Time as it is called in many countries ) is a way of getting more out of the summer days by advancing the clocks by one hour during the summer . Then , the sun will appear to rise one hour later in the morning when people are usually asleep anyway , at the benefit of one hour longer evenings when awake : The sunset and sunrise are one hour later than during normal time . DST could save energy ( less artificial light is needed during the evening ) and make the country more efficient in addition to the pleasing effect of lighter evenings . To make DST work , the clocks have to be adjusted one hour ahead when DST begins ( during spring ) , and adjusted back one hour to standard time every autumn . There are many countries observing DST , and many who do not . Benjamin Franklin suggested the method in 1784 , but it was first during World War I , in 1916 in several counties in Europe that DST was adopted , although it was proposed several times before , but rejected .",0

"what are the complications of unrepaired severed flexor tendons ? Hello I severed the FDP tendon of my right pinky finger last May . I am an art student , an oil painter and was horrified by the procedure and typical results of the recommended surgery so I did not have it . My injury does not impair my abilities at all , however it can get painful sometimes ... I was wondering if I can expect more serious complications of leaving the tendon unrepaired in the future ? Dynamic splinting after flexor tendon injuries of the hand in childhood ] [ Article in German ] Fasching G , Schmidt B , Friedrich H , Mayr J.Kinderchirurgischen Abteilung , Preyersches Kinderspital , Wien.Ninety severed flexor tendons were repaired in 24 boys and 14 girls in a four-year-period at the Department of Pediatric Surgery in Graz . Mean age was 4.9 years . In 16 patients ( 42 % ) additional lesions were found . Direct repair was performed with modified techniques of Kirchmayr ( 23 ) or Kleinert ( 8 ) . In four fingers , flexor tendon reconstructions were carried out . Postoperatively , the dynamic Kleinert splint was used for early nonresistive motion , beginning on average on the second postoperative day . Intensive training of motion was performed in physiotherapeutic sessions during a mean period of five months , postoperatively . In five cases tenolysis was performed ; in one case a rupture of a sutured tendon had to be corrected . 27 patients ( 71 % ) with 42 injured fingers were followed-up on average 2.7 years after the operation . In accordance with the Buck-Gramcko classification , very good results were achieved in 37 cases ( 88 % ) , and a poor result in one patient ( 2 % ) . Atraumatic technique , dynamic splinting , consequent physiotherapeutic training by experienced physiotherapists , and well informed parents will yield excellent results after flexor tendon repair in the paediatric age group.PMID : 9746876 [ PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE ] ==================================================I read this and other pubmed articles on your condition and it seems to me that the younger you are , the better your chances of not having complications . Also , the splinting and stitch type is important . In all tendon repair , the zig zag cut with cross stitch seems prefered and the scaring is the main complication . Physical therapy to reduce and stretch scaring is as vital as finding the right doctor for the operation . If you choose not to have the operation , you can reduce your pain with physical therapy such as strengh training , and my favorite , nerve stimulation . Get a shoe box and fill it with rice , dry beans , bean bag beads or other small rounded material and run the injured hand through it for about five minutes three times a day . This increases the blood flow and stimulates the nerves . Its a good way to relax arthritic hands too.The tendons in your hand have little room for blood flow to aid healing . Hot parafin wax treatments help greatly to aid the opening of small capillaries.I injured my hand in a fall about 6 years ago and still have stiffness even after doing all of the above for a very long time . But then again , I am much older and have other ailments that interfere with my healing process.Good luck in what ever you decide to do .",0

"Since reparations has been given due to past crimes against humanity should n't African Americans receive also ? Due to slavery and 400 yr+ of oppression also the unequal treatment of blacks in America due to White supremacy and injustice . Reparations in the United States have generally been limited to the survivors of government harm . Watch your terminology , though - slavery was not a crime until 1865 , since the government permitted slavery and only outlawed it through the Thirteenth Amendment after the Civil War.For instance , the United States paid survivors of Japanese internment programs from WWII . The program , however , was limited to survivors . No survivors of slavery exist today.A current reparations program would be too bizarre to fathom . All African-Americans were not harmed by slavery , after all , since some immigrated to America after slavery , or since some have no slave ancestors . It would be virtually impossible to require proof of slave ancestry , and then to divide some sum proportionately.Additionally , the vague `` 400 yr+ of oppression '' is unhelpful in crafting legislation . Slavery ended . Segregation did exist also , that 's ended for over 50 years now . If you 're problem with `` White supremacy and injustice , '' then I 'm afraid that no amount of money will solve the problem . Instead , educating future generations and winning over hearts and minds is the most effective remedy to injustice .",0
"How come you never see dead pigeons ? From straightdope : '' You do n't see many dead city pigeons for a couple of reasons . The first is that scavengers make pretty quick work of them . Insects alone can reduce a deceased pigeon to a heap of feathers and bones in a week or two . Rats , dogs , or other animals may drag the carcass off into some secret corner for a late snack . City sanitation crews occasionally stir themselves to scoop up a couple.The other reason you do n't see dead pigeons is that old and feeble ones usually hole up in some out-of-the-way place so they wo n't be seen by predators . Nooks and crannies in and around buildings are always popular , but I 'd say the pigeons ' favorite spot is the ironwork underneath viaducts . I recently inspected one near the office of the newspaper that publishes my column . I found the surrounding area littered with decaying remains . Mostly these were former editors sleeping it off . However , there were a bunch of dead pigeons , too . Naturally , I paused for a moment of respectful silence . For the pigeons . I mean , pigeons and editors both do the icky on the stuff you cherish most . But at least the pigeons do n't think , `` Wow , now it sings . '' ''",0

"Is the new King Kong a good movie ? It was great . It 's a plot you go into the movie knowing , and to have the movie move you still , means it is a great movie ! I 've seen many people claim it 's too long and that they should remove stuff before they reach Skull Island . I think the opposite , some of the special effect sequences ( which were great ) could be removed . The story of this movie is more about the relationship between the characters and the ape , not so much an action flick.I can see why Jackson did it that way though . For a movie to be financially successful it generally has to do well in the US market . The US movie-goer is very hooked on action and special effects , so that had to be in there along side the emotional story in order for it to be liked in the US .",0
"city ordinances adopted by the city jof braselton , ga ? the main focus of the search is for traffic ordinances that were changed from the official georgia code . Unforunately , Braselton does n't seem to have its city ordinances online . Your best choice is to visit the Braselton Public Library , at 65 Frances St. , 706-654-1992 , for more information . Contact the library , which should have the city ordinances compiled and available for public reference . If the library does not have the ordinances , you 'll have to contact city hall at 4982 Highway 53 , 706-654-3915 , for details on where to obtain the ordinances . The Braselton Public Library , or perhaps a larger library like the county or a university library , should also have the Georgia Annotated Statutes , where you can compare and contrast the Braselton ordinances with the Georige code .

"how can i quit smoking ? I quit once for 5 1/2 yrs , but now have been smoking for 3 yrs . I know i need to quit , but it is so hard . I used to smoke , the only way that I did it was pure willpower and mind over matter . You can do anything that you set your mind to , if you truly want it bad enough . So , go over again the reasons why you want to stop smoking , is it for yourself or for someone else ? If it is for yourself , then you are already half way there . Also , while you are trying to quit , do n't put yourself into situations or environments where you are going to be tempted to smoke because other people are smoking . Last but not least , make sure you have the support of your friends and family . If you are trying to stop smoking , others should respect this and not smoke around you .",0
"How do you really know when your in love with someone is it the sex , or just infatuation with their looks ? Simple ! Do one at a time . To find out if it 's love , do n't have sex or see that person , only talk on the phone . Actually talking only on the phone will tell you everything . If it 's the sex , then you will get bored and horny . If it is the looks then you will get bored and want to see that person . But , if it is love , then you miss seeing that person , and maybe even the sex , but you will not get bored because just hearing the person 's voice will make your heart skip a beat . But , my advice to you is that you should n't have sex with a person until you have established that fact anyhow . Sex complicates things !",0
"Do vitamins and other supplements really benefit you ? I am the world 's pickiest eater . I do not eat vegetables and I rarly eat fruit . Little meat and a lot of carbs . But I still want to stay healthy . So I want to know if this is a good way to do so without changing the way I am ? The human body comprises chemical compounds such as water , amino acids ( proteins ) , fatty acids ( lipids ) , nucleic acids ( DNA/RNA ) , and carbohydrates ( e.g . sugars ) . These compounds in turn consist of elements such as carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , and phosphorus , and may or may not contain minerals such as calcium , iron , and zinc . Minerals also ubiquitously occur in the form of salts and electrolytes . All of these chemical compounds and elements occur in various forms and combinations ( e.g . hormones/vitamins , phospholipids , hydroxyapatite ) , both in the human body and in organisms ( e.g . plants , animals ) that humans eat.The human body must necessarily comprise those elements that humans eat and absorb into the bloodstream . The digestive system , except in the unborn fetus , is the first step in helping to make the different chemical compounds and elements in food available for the trillions of cells of the body . In the digestive process of an average adult , about seven litres of liquid , known as digestive juices , exit the internal body and enter the lumen of the digestive tract . The digestive juices help break chemical bonds between ingested compounds as well as modulate the conformation and/or energetic state of the compounds/elements . Yet many compounds/elements are absorbed into the bloodstream unchanged , though the digestive process helps to release them from the matrix of the foods where they occur . Any unabsorbed matter is eliminated in the feces . Only a minimal amount of digestive juice is eliminated this way ; the intestines reabsorb most of it otherwise the body would rapidly dehydrate ( hence the devastating effects of persistent diarrhea ) .Study in this field must take into careful account the state of the body before ingestion and after digestion as well as the chemical content of both the food and the waste . The specific types of compounds and elements that are absorbed by the body can be determined by comparing the waste to the food . The effect that the absorbed matter has on the body can be determined by finding the difference between the pre-ingestion state and the post-digestion state . The effect may only be discernible after an extended period of time in which all food and ingestion must be exactly regulated and all waste must be analyzed . The number of variables ( e.g . 'confounding factors ' ) involved in this type of experimentation is very high . This makes scientifically valid nutritional study very time-consuming and expensive , which accounts for why a proper science of human nutrition is rather new.In general , eating a variety of fresh , whole ( unprocessed ) foods has proven hormonally and metabolically favourable compared to eating a monotonous diet based on processed foods . In particular , fresh , whole foods provide higher amounts and a more favourable balance of essential and vital nutrients per unit of energy , resulting in better management of cell growth , maintenance , and mitosis ( cell division ) as well as of appetite and energy balance . A generally more regular eating pattern ( e.g . eating medium-sized meals every 3 to 4 hours ) has also proven more hormonally and metabolically favourable than infrequent , haphazard food intake.Vitamins give you a complement among all the nutrients your body requires . It is not advisable at all to substitute entirely your meals with vitamins and dietary or food supplements . I recommend you to look for a nutritional advisor and discuss in which way you can adjust your meals , having all the necessary elements your body needs , plus , eating only what you like .",0

"When does state law supercede Federal law ? Federal law is , by virtue of the constitution , the `` law of the land , '' meaning that it supersedes in every instance where they may pass laws covering the same issue . On things like minimum wage , it 's not really an issue of superseding ; if federal law says it must be $ 5.15 or more , and state law says it must be $ 7.50 or more , the state law is within the requirements of the federal law . If the state law were less than $ 5.15 , the federal law would supersede it , because it would not be within the federal law 's requirements .",0

"What are the best studio monitor speakers for under $ 500 ? I assume here that you are asking about nearfield active monitors , and that you are aiming for sub- $ 500 for the pair ( not each ) . There are a few factors which play into the decision , including ( a ) the type of music you will be working with , ( b ) your workstation setup , and ( c ) the room.The type of music can determine whether or not you need a subwoofer . If you do , that 's an additional component which you will need to factor into your overall budget.The workstation setup will play into the positioning and power of the speakers . How much space do you have ? Where will the speakers go , and will they be near any walls or corners ? How will they be positioned relative to your head ? ( assuming nearfield ) The room can play a bit into the monitor decision , but it 's probably a bit more of a factor in tuning your setup once you have your monitors . Look into room acoustics as you 're making your monitor decision to understand what your overall monitoring/room setup will entail.Having thought a bit about the above , the key thing for monitors is to have something sufficiently detailed and revealing to make accurate mixes . Ideally , it wo n't be too fatiguing , as you will most likely be listening to them for extended periods of time . On top of that , it 's mostly a matter of getting accustomed to them so you can make accurate mixing decisions . The net of all of this is that monitor choices are fairly personal . Keep in mind that the goal is to get something accurate which will allow you to hear everything you need to hear , which is NOT the same as `` sounding good '' . Take some CDs and audition your top candidates against music you know well , focusing on key portions that highlight particular ranges or potential problem areas ( extended low bass , detailed highs , stereo imaging , etc . ) It can help to take some of your own mixes , if possible.Some specific inexpensive monitors I 've heard good things about are the KRK Rokits and the lower-end Events . Again , the key is to be familiar with the speakers so you can make accurate mixes .",0

"Though electron affinity of fluorine is greater than flourine , Flourine acts as a better oxidising agent.Why ? I am assuming you are talking about fluorine and chlorine . But electron affinity deals only with the atoms ability to accept an electron . Oxidation deals with interactions between atoms . Fluorine being smaller has more atoms that are close to the atom being oxidized and thus greater charge density around the atom it 's oxidizing . Electron affinity deals only with electrons and no atoms thus electron repulsion of the smaller fluorine orbitals cause a decrease in electron affinity when compared to the larger atom of chlorine . I am not sure this is correct but it is all I could think of . Good luck .",0

"Is LeBron James the next Michael Jordan ? Both number 23 ... Well , the thing that made Jordan great was not his skills . Yes he was a great player ( possibly one of the top two along with Wilt Chamberlain ) , he was a complete player . He could do everything excellently . He scored 30 points per game , grabbed over 5 boards , 3-4 assits , 2-3 steals , and even one season averaged a block per game . He was an all-around excellent player . There are other players even in his era who had just as many skills and were just as talented with natural ability . Scottie Pippen I think had more natural potential as was more graceful . Certainly Dominique Wlikens was more powerful.The thing that made Jordan great was his intelligence and his primacy ; his ability to get up for a game and take it to the next level . He thrived on pressure . He could get into another players head and totally shut them down from the inside out . When the game was on the line he took the game to another emotional level that had so much stress and pressure to it that every other opposing player was crushed by it and all his teammates fed off of it . Jordan 's natural talent was limited . He was n't even picked for his high school team the first time around . Lebron only went to high school . He is not mentally the same player as Jordan , and he never will be .",0

"how to concentrate a UV light to a coherent light ? this question does n't make sense ( it 's incoherent HAH ! sorry.. corny joke . ) light from a light bulb is called incoherent light because it 's made up of many different waves . waves as you know have a property called phase , which tells you where along the wave-front you are at a given position and time . incoherent light is a mixture of light waves with random phases.coherent light on the other hand , is used to describe light where all of the waves have the same phase - so the waves peak and trough at exactly the same time and position . coherent light is much more intense than incoherent light because all of the phase fronts add up constructively , and so you end up with a very large amplitude wave.so , if you `` concentrate '' UV light , by using a lens or some other sort of focusing device , it will be more intense than the spread-out light , but it wo n't be coherent . the only way to get coherent light is at the source - for instance , an excimer laser can be tuned to emit in the ultraviolet , and the light will be coherent . there is no ( known ) way to convert incoherent light into coherent light , though that 's not to say it 's impossible - such a thing just has n't been invented .",0

"*Ali versus Tyson* Who would win ? This is a theoretical question ( of course Tyson would win today ) . If both men were in their prime at the peak of their success and squared off who would win ? Mike Tyson in his prime was a monster . With his power and skill combined , you 'd think he was unbeatable . He knew how to bob and weave right under an opponent 's punches and come back with vicious combos to the head and body.However , I do n't think any heavyweight boxer ever could outbox Ali . Muhammad Ali knew how to use the ring and could use his reach advantage to keep Tyson at the perfect distance to land punches while avoiding being hit himself . Not that I do n't think Ali could n't take Tyson 's punches , but those body shots would have worn him down a bit by the later rounds.Overall , I say an unanimous decision victory for Ali , though not a very impressive one .",0

Lightning causes the air to displace and when it contracts again ( immediately ) you get thunder , the sound of air filling a gap .

You can generally determine how far away you are from the place of origin by counting 1 one-hundred , 2 one hundred , etc until you hear thunder and divide that number by two . That is how many miles away you are.BTW , if you see lightning and hear thunder at the same time , the event is right where you are !",0
"What is the bladder 's job ? In the anatomy of mammals , the urinary bladder is the organ that collects urine excreted by the kidneys prior to disposal by urination . Urine enters the bladder via the ureters and exits via the urethra. -- -- -- -- -AnatomyThe urinary bladder is a hollow , muscular and distensible organ that sits on the pelvic floor ( superior to the prostate in males ) . On its anterior border lies the pubic symphysis and , on its posterior border , the vagina ( in females ) and rectum ( in males ) . The urinary bladder is normally capable of storing 1.1-1.3 liters of urine , but because it is made up of transitional epithelium it is able to stretch to volumes of even several litres.The ureters enter the bladder diagonally from its dorsolateral floor in an area called the trigone . The trigone is a triangular shaped area on the postero-inferior wall of the bladder . The urethra exits at the lowest point of the triangle of the trigone -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Detrusor muscleThe detrusor muscle is a layer of the urinary bladder wall , made up of smooth muscle fibers arranged in inner and outer longitudinal layers and a middle circular layer . Contraction of the detrusor muscle causes the bladdar to expel urine through the urethra . Problems with this muscle can lead to incontinence .",0
"Is body odor really an aphrodisiac ? Here 's some text from a 2002 study reported in Neuroendrocrinology Letters that indicates male pheremones ( at the heart of `` body odor '' ) may have a positive attractiveness effect to a majority of women.Previous research has revealed that natural and synthetic pheromones can enhance ratings of opposite sex attractiveness . The present study investigated the effects of exposure to male axillary secretions on female ratings of the sexual attractiveness of male stimuli . Thirty-two female undergraduates , half of whom were contraceptive pill users , rated male vignette characters and photographs of male faces on aspects of attractiveness . On two separate study days , corresponding to different phases of their menstrual cycle , stimuli were presented while exposed to male axillary pheromones and under a control condition ( no pheromone ) . The order of testing was balanced with respect to pheromone/control condition and menstrual cycle phase . Pheromone exposure resulted in significantly higher attractiveness ratings of vignette characters and faces . Use of the contraceptive pill or menstrual cycle phase had equivocal effects on some vignette items and neither had any influence on female ratings of male facial attractiveness . The results of this study suggest that exposure to natural male axillary pheromones can significantly enhance female perceptions of various aspects of male attractiveness. -- -- -There 's no question that overt and extreme body odor is repellent to many ( and certainly it can be ! ) -- especially since we 've been trained by countless advertisements to find it so . However , it 's an evolutionary adaptation of some kind , which ( certainly in the pre-bath eras ) must have operated as a signal of some kind to females : of health , of strength , of non-sickness perhaps .",0

Crystals of salt , icing sugar , etc.2 . Fibres of cotton , wool , synthetics , string , etc.3 . The torn edges of paper.4 . The individual dots of colour from non-glossy pictures . You will probably have to add a bit more illumination from above the sample for this by shining a light onto it ( e.g . desk light ) .5 . Leaf 'skeletons'.6 .

"My friend is a marathon runner and he is getting cramps at mile 18 . What can he do ? He has run 4 marathons. ? Cramps are usually the result of mineral depletion . Others have advised about replenishing water and sodium , but overlook the importance of potassium , and , to a lesser extent , magnesium . While in training , he should have his potassium level checked to see if it is well within normal range ( 4.0 to 5.0 ) If not , he should ask his doctor about possible daily supplements . If it is normal , he should consider potassium loading before the race ( good foods include bananas , sweet potatoes , oranges ) and then supplementing during the race , either with pills ( preferably with a doctor 's OK ) , or , if his gastro system can handle it , orange juice or other high potassium fluids ; most sports drinks have only trace amounts of potassium . I 've run a few marathons and run at a relaxed pace , and thus it does n't bother my stomach to drink a quart of OJ an hour before the race and a pint at mile 14 ( supplied by a waiting family member ) , and this has helped reduce cramping a lot - I used to get severe charley horses at mile 19 . Tell your friend to search potassium loading on the web , there are a few references to it in marathon forums . The caveat is that a high potassium level is dangerous ; in people with normal kidney function , the kidney sloughs off any excess harmlessly ; but if renal function is impaired , high doses of potassium are contraindicated .",0

"How can you ? how can you tell that chlorine is a gas at room temperature ? Well , do you know about intermolecular forces ? There are four types of intermolecular forces : 1 . London dispersion2 . Dipole-dipole3 . Hydrogen bonding4 . Ion-dipoleThe weakest of these four forces is the first one , London dispersion , which happens to be the only one that chlorine molecules exert on each other . Chlorine molecules ( Cl2 ) are diatomic and nonpolar ( two identical atoms bonded together can not have polarity because they pull on the electrons with the same strength ) . That means that they only exert London dispersion forces on each other , which is weak . That means that chlorine molecules are n't really attached to each other that well , so they can just fly away from each other as gas very easily . This is why chlorine is a gas at room temperature , and that 's how you can tell ( or at least make a smart prediction ; it 's hard to know for sure ) with chlorine and other molecules and compounds . Figure out what kind of intermolecular forces you 're dealing with .",0

"Why does science and religion conflict with each other so much ? Old Goat is correct . It would help to know specifics . But consider just ONE example . The book of Job is the oldest book in the Bible . It even predates Moses . So , in that period of time , how did other cultures view the earth ? Flat , supported by Atlas or giant elephants ... But look what it reads in the book of Job ... `` God hangs the earth on nothing . '' And in Isaiah it reads , `` It is God who sits above the circle of the earth . '' That word `` circle '' in Hebrew is ball or sphere . So if people poopoo the Bible with their lofty scientific thinking , they have probably not even read the Bible to check . I know scientists who have read the Bible , and are amazed at how accurate it is.We know that all matter is made up of atoms and electrons . I nor any scientist has ever seen an electron . But because of scientific study , we know they exist . The Bible reads in Hebrews 11:3 ... '' Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear . `` So the only conflict comes when secular scientist blow off the Bible without cause .

"Is it possible to continue to move forward and never reach a destination ? Example , if I draw a dot 10 spaces apart from each other , I begin at point A and move one full space towards point B ( now 9 full spaces away , but on every next move I take 1/2 of my previous move , i.e . after the next move point B is 8 1/2 spaces away . If I continue the movements at 1/2 increments of my proevious move , I am still moving forward but theoretically I never reach my destination which is a fixed point . Is that correct ? Does that mean that there are an infinite amount of numbers between 1 & 2 ? What you are describing is an infinite series using a decreasing geometric progression . The sum of such a series can be described by this proof : Let T = total distance traveled ( in spaces ) Then T = 1 + ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ... Also T - 1 = ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ... And if we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:2* ( T - 1 ) = 2* ( ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ... ) Multiplying through:2T - 2 = 1 + ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ...

"Is it better to rent , own or build a home in California these days ? Seems that renting is cheaper and you could save money .

California is among the most overheated markets in real estate so buying now MAY get you into a financial mess by overpaying . Renting is always a waste of money .

One man was wearing a red suit ; one a green suit ; and the other a blue suit . `` Have you noticed , '' said the man the blue suit , `` that although our suits have colors corresponding to our names , not one of us is wearing a suit that matches our own names ? '' Mr. Red looked at the other two and said , `` You 're absolutely correct . `` What color suit is each man wearing ? If we apply logic to this , we can assume that since Mr. Red LOOKED at the man with the blue suit , so hence , Mr. Red is n't wearing blue , and since he ca n't wear his own color , then he must be wearing green . Following this , then , the man in the blue suit has to be either Mr. Green , or Mr. Blue .

It will be a word that you should have been studying in class.Ie. , Adaptation - mutations that give an organism an advantageMutation - alterations in genetic makeupEvolution - changes in organisms over time due to adaptationNatural Selection - conditions which select adaptationsI would go with adaptation , but no guarantees . The concept here is that as we take antibiotics we kill a lot of bacteria , but not all of them . The remaining few that survive are the `` tougher '' ones , at least ones that are n't affected as much by the antibiotics . These remaining bacteria may continue to grow in numbers . If they ever succeed in infecting more people , the antibiotics will now do nothing.P.S ... A lot of people think that bacteria randomly mutate until one of them becomes resistant . This is only part of the story . Antibiotics almost always originate from other bacteria , or some other organism trying to fend off bacteria . These antibiotics are not new , just new to medicine . Bacteria have been resisting these antibiotics for millions of years . Maybe not actively , but somewhere in their past it has probably been encountered .

"why do guys hurt girls but they say they love u and would do anything for you ? they are just ass holes that dont no what they want untill they lose you so why is that why do guys have to hurt you and you are really in love with them can some one answer that for me . Some guys never figure out what they really want & others think that the sole aim in life is to have someone that will sleep with them on a regular basis . There are , however , good men out there ... it just normally takes them awhile to gain the maturity needed to be a partner in a relationship.Why do they lose you & then want you back ? Simple ; some are incapable of seeing how good a thing they had until it is gone & immature enough to think that a little `` I love you '' will make everything better . They do n't understand that , if a man really loves a woman , he does n't intentionally hurt her ... whether physically or emotionally.Good luck & keep trying ! You 'll find a good guy . I know they are n't all taken : )",0

We are very alike , and she said I was more mature than her ex . She also mentioned that maturity was big with her . So then the movie she wanted to see started in 2 hours . To my surprise she wanted to wait . We then went to some benches and started talking , where I went noble and told everything . It did n't kill things as we still talked .

"what do you do for excessive mucus production ? I have excessive mucus production . I have two sinus surgerys , but the mucus was there befor the surgerys . It is so bad that it comes from my gums . I have a bad cough , it always produces a mouth full of mucus . It pockets in the back of my throat . It has gotten so bad that it disrupts my sleep . I take a cloth to bed each night to clean my mouth . If any one has ever had this problem , please let me know what you did for relife . I have spent a small fortune on doctors and medicine . As of now , no help . Thank you . I had the same problem , I could n't breathe through my nose because , my nose and mouth were constantly full of mucus and I was constantly spitting out this gunk . Sometimes , I would be choking and gagging in my sleep . A relative sent me a print-out of the side effects of the medication I was taking . It included breathing problems , mucus buildup , nodules ( which I now have exactly where my sinuses are ) and a lot of other dangerous side effects . I went off the med . and while I still have some mucus production it is no where near what it used to be . My doctor tried to get me to go back on the same med . even after I told him about the mucus problems it caused . He said it did n't do that . When I insisted that it did , he looked it up on his computer and then said `` if that happens again , you can always go off it '' . Needless to say , I refused to take it . Also , on one exam , the nurse told me I had polyps in my nose . She told me to see an ENT and have them removed ( surgically ) . I am glad I did n't . I just saw an M.D . on tv who said that when polyps in your nose are removed , they usually will come back . He said a safe non-surgical way to get rid of them is to use Nasonex twice a day and it is safe to do that . I think I 'll take his advice and try it . I do n't know why some doctors first advice is surgery especially if there is a non-surgical way to remedy a problem . I hope you find a solution to your problems .",0

"why are you a Christian ? honestly I was introduced to Christianity growing up , but that is n't why I 'm Christian . It is very obvious to me that someone had to create the world and universe . So many wonderful miraculous things happen to people that can not be explained by logic , or natural order . Even the complexity of natural order is too vast to be by impossible chance . This led me to know that there is a Supreme Being.As for why Christianity , there are a couple of reasons . The Bible has never been proven inacurate , which supports the fact that it is divinely inspired . Some good/interesting books about this topic are written by Lee Strobel `` The Case for Christ '' `` The Case for a Creator '' and a couple more . Even when the Bible has n't been believed , someone has come across ruins that disproves man 's theory , and inforces that the Bible is right . Creation interpretation of data makes sense to me , and having the world be ~6000 years old gets rid of lots of problems ( like there should be billions more people on the earth if it has been around for millions of years , the fact that trees that are buried in layers supposedly thousands of years apart should have rotted , not nearly enough fossils- let alone NONE that are inbetweens , etc ) . These are physical external reasons to me.There is also a much more important internal aspect to why I allow Christ to rule my life . Reading His Word , applying His principles ( which never contradict each other ) , and knowing that someone always loves me no matter how much I screw up has made a difference in my life . This change is so real that I can be certain of God , His Son , and the Holy Spirit . I now never have that 'does anybody care ? ' empty feeling , or the 'why am I even here/what is the point of existance ? ' attitude . This does not mean that I have the perfect life , and all is sunshine . I sometimes have down days , I still get frusterated at times and ask why , but there is always an instruction manual to go to , and He is always with me . That is a very comforting thought , that the God of the entire universe specifically loves me , cares about me , listens to me whenever I take the time to talk with Him , and can change my attitudes and bless me . How wonderful !",0

"Does the sun really set when we see it disappear in the horizon or before ? My question is about optics . The short answer is : Yes.I think the previous people who attempted to answer this question did not read it carefully . The atmosphere is in layers , of different densities , that refract the sunlight and different colors different amounts . The light is bent downwards because the speed of light in the upper layers is greater than the speed of light in the layers closer to the ground . One can see this effect in the change in shape of the sun as it sets , and the effects like disconnected pieces of sun , green flashes , etc . This is just the same as the effect that creates mirages , or the spurious images of water on or above dry roads in the heat .

"What is the best ammunition for the S & W .357 Magnum ? I recently purchased a S & W Model 686P 4 '' Barrel.What is the best .357 ammo to use for target practice ? What is the best .38 special ammo for target practice ? What is the best .357 ammo for knock-down power ? Thanks in advance , Barry Your questions are like asking what is the prettiest color for an automobile ! Personally I would suggest you shoot various weights and loads to see which are the most pleasant to shoot and which provide the best accuracy . Even for practice you might want to stay away from lead as it tends to create more cleaning problems over the long haul . You can find excellent prices for ammo at Natchez Shooters Supplies ( www.natchezss.com ) . Do n't forget to wear hearing and eye protection !",0

"How do I know if my childs imagination is too extensive ? She is 3yrs old and has several imaginary friends , insists we feed her dolls our food at meals , and she is constantly making up stories about when she was older or a baby . I 'm beginning to think she 's losing touch with reality . While having an active imagination is no crime and certainly should n't alarm you as a parent , you might consider what these friends provide for your daughter . It seems like she has experienced some instability in life right now and if she is feeling detached from her father , then she may be concerned that you , her mother might also unexpectedly leave or disappear . She is only 3 and is limited on her ability to communicate and understand these abandoning feelings and may have created an abundance of imaginary friends because she knows she can count on them not leaving . She may not be able to say , `` Mommy , are you going to leave too ? '' But she can create a fantasy of dolls and imaginary friends that support and validate her feelings . So while I would n't say that you should seek clinical therapy for your 3 year old , I would suggest that a sincere heart to heart with your daughter , and some invested mommy time , you could really help your daughter reconnect to the real supports in her life , you ! Suggestion : Find a way to validate her feelings . Having a drawing party ! Allow her to draw , and invite her imaginary friends to draw also . Sit at a table that is age appropriate for her ( or sit on the floor ) and allow her to describe to you the drawings of all the friends , as well as her own drawing . You might suggest to her drawing a few pictures . Maybe one of `` our new house '' . Have another drawing of `` our family '' , and her school/friends , room or house . You will learn a lot from her and it will allow her practice in expressing her feelings to you , her mom , rather than dolls and friends . Find age appropriate ways of bonding with your daughter . I would love to hear what you try and how it turns out ! Good Luck ! emailjacquisoon @ yahoo.com",0

"Why did the German government introduce Submarine warfare ? NO SPAM PLZ ! I presume you mean `` unrestricted '' submarine warfare.The short answer was to win the war . A better answer was because the English blockade of of Germany had the effect of starving the German populace of both food and resources.During WW1 , the British Navy was the most powerful force in the world . The German surface Navy could not hope to be an effective counter to it , so Germany had to resort to tactics other than traditional surface conflict . Submarines or Unterseebooten ( U-Boats ) were one means employed by the Germans . U-Boats were the `` Stealth Bombers '' of thier day . They could sneak up on surface ships undetected , and sink them with torpedoes.Germany 's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was originally instituted to combat the overwhelming superiority of the English Navy , but when they started sinking un-armed vessels with other nations peoples on board ( specifically Americans ) this helped draw America into the war . When the American 's arrived , it tipped the balance in favor of the allies ultimately losing the war for Germany .",0

"i want information on VLSI systems or paper on it. ? i want to present paper on VLSI systems . Very-large-scale integration ( VLSI ) of systems of transistor-based circuits into integrated circuits on a single chip first occurred in the 1980s as part of the semiconductor and communication technologies that were being developed.The first semiconductor chips held one transistor each . Subsequent advances added more and more transistors , and as a consequence more individual functions or systems were integrated over time . The microprocessor is a VLSI device.The first `` generation '' of computers relied on vacuum tubes . Then came discrete semiconductor devices , followed by integrated circuits . The first Small-Scale Integration ( SSI ) ICs had small numbers of devices on a single chip – diodes , transistors , resistors and capacitors ( no inductors though ) , making it possible to fabricate one or more logic gates on a single device . The fourth generation consisted of Large-Scale Integration ( LSI ) , i.e . systems with at least a thousand logic gates . The natural successor to LSI was VLSI ( many tens of thousands of gates on a single chip ) . Current technology has moved far past this mark and today 's microprocessors have many millions of gates and hundreds of millions of individual transistors.As of mid-2004 , billion-transistor processors are not yet economically feasible for most uses , but they are achievable in laboratory settings , and they are clearly on the horizon as semiconductor fabrication moves from the current generation of 90 nanometer ( 90nm ) processes to the next 65nm and 45nm generations.At one time , there was an effort to name and calibrate various levels of large-scale integration above VLSI . Terms like Ultra-large-scale Integration ( ULSI ) were used . But the huge number of gates and transistors available on common devices has rendered such fine distinctions moot . Terms suggesting more-than-VLSI levels of integration are no longer in widespread use . Even VLSI is now somewhat quaint , given the common assumption that all microprocessors are VLSI or better .",0

"What is the temperature of an absolute vacuum ? No one can give me a good answer to this . i never really thought about it and so i was just going to say that temperature doesnt matter because its a vacuum and is dealing with the pressure ... but when i thought about it ... come to think of it , i do have an answer for you . the temperature would be zero kelvin , absolute zero . in an absolute vacuum , the pressure would be 0 if there were no particles , because the more particles you cram into one place , the more pressure there is because p=F/A pressure equals the force of the particles divided by the area of the wall of the container , so with no force of particles ( since there are no partiles ) , the pressure would be zero . in an absolute vacuum , there are no particles . Now , if the pressure is zero , then according to the formula PV=nRT ( which is just the ideal gas law formula , ) if P ( pressure ) equals 0 , i think that means that T ( temperature in Kelvin ) would also be 0 which would mean that the temperature would be at absolute zero ( which is defined as the temperature where all matter stops moving.. not that this would make a difference because there are no particles there because it 's an absolute vacuum . This is what i suspect and to confirm my beliefs , it is consistent with the fact that someone else said that outer space was 3K , and although it 's very close to an absolute vacuum , there are a few particles and atoms of gas floating around there , and so it is not quite an absolute vacuum , and the temperature is 3K , meaning it 's not quite at absolute zero . so it stands to reason that since temperature decreases when pressure decreases , that in an absolute vacuum the temperature would be absolute zero , 0 kelvin.i hope this is a `` good answer '' and that i made sense while i took you through my reasoning : )",0

"why there is 28 days on Feburary ? February is the second month of the year in the Gregorian Calendar . It is the shortest Gregorian month and the only month with the length of 28 or 29 days . The month has 29 days in leap years , when the year number is divisible by four ( except for years that are divisible by 100 and not by 400 ) . In other years the month has 28 days.February begins , astronomically speaking , with the sun in the constellation of Capricornus and ends with the sun in the constellation of Aquarius . Astrologically speaking , February begins with the sun in the sign of Aquarius and ends in the sign of Pisces.February was named for the Roman god Februus , the god of purification . January and February were the last two months to be added to the Roman calendar , since the Romans originally considered winter a monthless period . This change was made by Numa Pompilius about 700 BC in order to bring the calendar in line with a standard lunar year . Numa 's Februarius contained 29 days ( 30 in a leap year ) . Augustus is alleged to have removed one day from February and added it to August , ( renamed from Sextilis to honor himself ) , so that Julius Caesar 's July would not contain more days . However there is little historical evidence to support this claim.February was nominally the last month of the Roman calendar , as the year originally began in March . At certain intervals Roman priests inserted an intercalary month , Mercedonius , after February to realign the year with the seasons.Historical names for February include the Anglo-Saxon terms Solmoneth ( mud month ) and Kale-monath ( named for cabbage ) as well as Charlemagne 's designation Hornung . In old Japanese calendar , the month is called Kisaragi ( 如月 , 絹更月 or 衣更月 ) . It is sometimes also called Mumetsuki ( 梅見月 ) or Konometsuki ( 木目月 ) . In Finnish , the month is called helmikuu , meaning `` month of the pearl '' .February is recognized as Black History Month in the United States and Canada . `` February '' is pronounced without the first r , as `` Febuary '' , by many speakers . This is probably elision , or an analogical change influenced by `` January '' .",0

How we deal with hate and it 's horrible effects on peace loving people around the world will ultimately determine if we are successful in defeating hate filled terrorists and their divisive endeavors.We also need to support our troops who ultimately deal with those who hate our way of life most face-to-face bravely.This is not a typical war and the theatre of operation is world wide , it ’ s a new day and we as peace loving people need to understand conventional warfare as our grand fathers and fathers knew it is over .",0

"when was karate invented ? Karate is a multi-cultural development , absorbing the contributions of many gifted practitioners over time and crossing many borders . Compiling a reasonably accurate history of Karate is challenging.The development of Karate occurred chiefly in Okinawa and China in the 19th century , and Japan in the early 20th century . This was an especially turbulent period in history for that area of the world , including Japan 's official annexation of the Okinawan island group in 1874 , the First Sino-Japanese War ( 1894-1895 ) , the Russo-Japanese War ( 1904-1905 ) , and the rise of Japanese expansionism ( 1905-1945 ) . The wars caused disruptions and upheaval , and incentives for concealment . The Karate styles within Japan have fairly clean lineages ; but any assessment of how Karate crossed borders in this period is complicated by issues of nationalism , the historic Japanese racism faced by non-Japanese Asians , and the typical resentment of occupied peoples toward a conqueror . Many recognizeable offshoots of Karate , particularly in Korea , deny the name because of nationalistic ideals and the word 's association with Japan ; likewise , some obvious offshoots of Karate are disowned by Japanese practitioners , perhaps because of a Japanese preoccupation with primacy or purity . [ edit ] Karate 's Origins in OkinawaJapan annexed the nominally independent Okinawan island group in 1874 after centuries of strong Japanese influence over the kingdom 's affairs . One might suggest that something of `` Okinawan '' origin ( such as Karate ) could be equally desribed as being of `` Japanese '' origin . The relationship between Okinawa and Japan is complicated . For purposes of discussing Karate , it is convenient to speak of Okinawa and Japan as separate entities . The question of whether Karate is Japanese or Okinawan is somewhat akin to asking whether the luau or the hula dance are American traditions or Hawaiian ones . They developed in Hawaii prior to when Hawaii became one of the United States , and so are usually described as Hawaiian , not American . Similarly for Karate , which is of Okinawan origin . [ edit ] HistoryKarate is a mixture of indigenous Okinawan fighting arts and empty-handed Chinese fighting arts , the latter having been brought to Okinawa by political envoys , merchants , and sailors to and from Fujian Province . Estimates of the amount of Chinese influence vs. Okinawan influence in modern Karate vary considerably , from 40 % Chinese/40 % Okinawan/20 % other to 80 % Chinese/20 % Okinawan . Some believe that there is also a Japanese jujutsu influence stemming from the long Japanese presence on Okinawa.In 1722 , Sakugawa , who had studied pugilism and staff fighting in China , started teaching a fighting art in the city of Shuri that he called `` Karate-no-sakugawa . '' This was the first known recorded reference to the art of Karate ( 唐手 ) in a modern form . The word `` Kara '' ( 唐 ) referred to China itself , and `` Te '' ( 手 ) meant hand , in the sense of a style of fighting ; so Karate meant `` the Chinese techniques '' or `` Tang Hand '' .To this day Karate still bears a striking resemblance to Fujian martial arts such as Fujian White Crane , Five Ancestors , and Goroquan ( Hard Soft Fist , pronounced `` Gōjūken '' in Japanese ) . For the most part there were no particular styles of `` te '' , but rather a network of practitioners with their own individual methods and eclectic traditions . Early styles of karate can be generalized as Shuri-te , Naha-te and Tomari-te , named after the three cities in which they emerged . Each city ( and the teachers who lived there ) had particular kata , techniques , and principles that distinguished its local version of te from the others.Around the 1820 's , Sokon Matsumura taught a synthesis of te ( Shuri-te and Tomari-te ) and Shaolin ( Chinese 少林 ) styles . It would become the style Shorin-Ryu ( `` Little Forest '' ) . Matsumura taught his karate to An",0

"what is Tourette Syndrome ? Tourette Syndrome Gilles de la Tourette syndrome ( Tourette Syndrome or TS ) is a neurological disorder which becomes evident in early childhood or adolescence between the ages of 2 and 15 . Tourette syndrome is defined by multiple motor and vocal tics lasting for more than one year . Many people have only motor tics or only vocal tics . The first symptoms usually are involuntary movements ( tics ) of the face , arms , limbs or trunk . These tics are frequent , repetitive and rapid . The most common first symptom is a facial tic ( eye blink , nose twitch , grimace ) , and is replaced or added to by other tics of the neck , trunk , and limbs . These involuntary ( outside the patient 's control ) tics may also be complicated , involving the entire body , such as kicking and stamping . Many person report what are described as premonitory urges -- the urge to perform a motor activity . Other symptoms such as touching , repetitive thoughts and movements and compulsions can occur . There are also verbal tics . These verbal tics ( vocalizations ) usually occur with the movements ; later they may replace one or more motor tics . These vocalizations include grunting , throat clearing , shouting and barking . The verbal tics may also be expressed as coprolalia ( the involuntary use of obscene words or socially inappropriate words and phrases ) or copropraxia ( obscene gestures ) . Despite widespread publicity , coprolalia/copropraxia is uncommon with tic disorders",0

"Is it ever okay to get a divorce in the eyes of God ? What if you married an aethiest or an agnostic ? What if your husband beats you to a pulp continuously ... and there are kids involved ? What if your husband is cheating on you ... and wo n't stop ? Are you just supposed to stick it out because of the vows you took ? ( This really is n't a personal experience question so I do n't need advice on how to go to a woman 's shelter or anything ) . Although I am answering from a Catholic perspective , the theology is fairly universal.Jesus forbade divorce , except in cases of adultery . However , a divorce also implies that there was a marriage . This tends to be the angle that the Catholic church approaches the breakdown of a legal marriage , and that is , `` was it even a marriage ? `` Marriage is , as Jesus puts it , `` when two become one flesh '' , people whom God himself has `` joined together . '' A sacramental moment of that magnitude requires that people enter it with full consent , and that consent requires both the personal maturity to give that consent as well as having all the information needed to make that consent . Take abuse , for instance - abuse implies a kind of marital fraud . Nobody would knowingly start dating someone who they knew was going to beat them , right ? An abusive person is always going to put their best foot forward at first and hide that aspect of themselves until a time when they feel safe to let it out . This is a fraud - and if a person marries such a person , they are n't doing it with that full consent of the will necessary for a marriage to truly exist.So a civil divorce may not always be a wrong thing to do , if it really is more of an annulment of a marriage that never truly was.Also - the other thing to keep in mind , is that what Jesus specifically condemned was divorce and remarriage , not divorce alone . So even if the marriage was valid in the eyes of God - i.e . abuse , lies , fraud , alcoholism were n't part of the breakdown , it was a valid marriage - it is only remarriage that he 's actually condemned.An aside : marriage was not created by the state . It long predates the state . Marriage was deeded to the state by religion ...",0

Or if you really wish to cast this in terms of willpower , it 's the distinction between divine willpower and human willpower .

[ 8 ] All who ever came before Me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not hear them . [ 9 ] I am the door . If anyone enters by Me , he will be saved , and will go in and out and find pasture . John 6:44 ( NKJV ) No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him ; and I will raise him up at the last day . John 6:45 ( NKJV ) It is written in the prophets , 'And they shall all be taught by God . ' Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me . John 15:16 ( NKJV ) You did not choose Me , but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit , and that your fruit should remain , that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you . Ephes . 1:4-5 ( NKJV ) just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love , [ 5 ] having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself , according to the good pleasure of His will , Romans 8:29-30 ( NKJV ) For whom He foreknew , He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son , that He might be the firstborn among many brethren . [ 30 ] Moreover whom He predestined , these He also called ; whom He called , these He also justified ; and whom He justified , these He also glorified .",0

Quadrilateral ABCD formatted like this : A DB CGiven : < A is congruent to < C < B is congruent to < DProve : ABCD is a parallelogramHow do I do this ? Thanks in advance . this is difficult to do without drawing . but here 's the gist of it.1 . < a + < b + < c + < d = 360 ( definition of quadrilateral ) 2 . < a + < b + < a + < b = 360 ( since a = c and b = d ) 3 . 2 ( a + b ) = 3604. a + b = 1805 . < a and < b are supplementary anglesnow extend the line AB and include a new point X , so you have a picture that looks like : XA DB C < XAD and < BAD are supplementary since XAB is a lineabove we proved that < ABC and < BAD are also supplementaryso < XAD + < BAD = 180and < ABC + < BAD = 180which means < XAD = < ABCso now we can conclude that AD || BCbecause the corresponding angles < XAD and < ABC are congruent.you can use this same logic to show that AB || DChope this makes sense..",0

"If Catholıc are donatıng a huge amount of money to charıtıes , why there always a NEWS of HUNGER ın the world Not all charities deal with hunger . The catholic church is a frequent location for the donations . The church has numerous employees at every church as well as support staff at the diocese level and at the Vatican . Most of these staff members are salaried while the Priests & etc have most of their expenses paid for through these donations . The staff members are to be treated like members of any business and receive pension and health care adding additional costs . Other costs that individual churches have include heating and cooling costs . If you think your heating bills are bad , think of a large building with lots of windows and doors frequently being opened.The church itself has numerous missions besides just feeding the hungry . Frequently churches have nurses on staff to visit the elderly home bound and others who may need help in administering special medication and can not afford nursing homes or a onsite nurse . There are frequently nuns on paid staff that visit the ill , the dying , etc . Some churches have other ministries as well depending on the local area . Catholics are also big on right to life and spend considerable resources attempting to deny people 's right to choose . They are also suppose to be opposed to the death penalty and also working against the archaic penalty but is nomally the work of a few individuals.All of these different things I have mentioned are just a few of the items that the church works on as well as hunger . That being said , Catholics are individuals and also give to other charities that they have personal interests in . From cancer research to colleges , it all stretches the dollar even further.Everywhere I have been , the protestants have tended to have much more open pocketbooks . It may have something to do with the silly notion that catholics have that every sperm is sacred and thus have more kids . The point is , everyone overlooks the most needy , not just Catholics .",0

"what is human relation in business psychology ? The human relations movement was initiated by psychologists and employment experts in the United States in the 1920s . The movement viewed workers in terms of their psychology and fit with companies , rather than as interchangeable parts.This view was advanced in reaction to the efficiency focus of Taylorism in the early 1900s . Though human resources have been part of business and organisations since the first days of agriculture , the modern concept of human resources was codified by advocates of a human relations view.This movement grew throughout the middle of the 20th century , placing emphasis on how leadership , cohesion , and loyalty played important roles in organizational success , and on the value of participatory management . Although this view was increasingly challenged by more quantitatively rigorous and less `` soft '' management techniques in the 1960s and beyond , human resources had gained a permanent role within the firm .",0

"when was the first time that butterfly stroke was done swimming ? Would like to know the first time that butterfly stoke was used in swimming and who invented it . In 1934 , however , David Armbruster , coach at the University of Iowa , devised a double overarm recovery out of the water . This `` butterfly '' arm action gave more speed but required greater training and conditioning . Then in 1935 , Jack Sieg , a University of Iowa swimmer , developed the skill of swimming on his side and beating his legs in unison like a fish 's tail . He then developed the leg action face down . Armbruster and Sieg combined the butterfly arm action with this leg action and learned to coordinate the two efficiently . With two kicks to each butterfly arm action , Sieg swam 100 yards in 1:00.2 . This kick was named the dolphin fishtail kick.Even though the butterfly breaststroke , as it was called , was faster than the breaststroke , the dolphin fishtail kick was declared a violation of competitive rules . For the next 20 years , champion breaststrokers used an out-of-water arm recovery ( butterfly ) with a shortened breaststroke kick . In 1953 , the butterfly stroke with the dolphin kick was legalized as a separate stroke for competition . Many swimmers say the `` wiggle '' is the key to the stroke and that a swimmer who can undulate through the water naturally can more easily learn the butterfly .",0
"What are some exotic animals I can keep as pets ? ? ? I am crazy about animals ... I already own 7 cats and 2 dogs ! ! ! But I do n't think so its enough..I am looking for something exotic..no birds..and something which is 'legal ' in the US . I always wanted a leopard ! ! I 'm particularly fond of reptiles . Snakes in particular , I like the large breeds . However , it is an awesome responsibility to take on many types of exotic pets . They require considerable financial and time investiments on your part . Just being `` crazy about animals '' is NO where near enough . You MUST be willing to take on the very special needs of the pet . My Red Tailed Boa , for example , is considered a `` giant snake '' . She will likely reach 10 foot long ( she is already 8 1/2 or so ) and eats two `` collossal sized '' rats every 10 days or so . Her cage is 2'X 2'X 8 ' on a 3 ' tall cabinet . Its roughly 300 gallons and is simply adequate for her size at this point . Her humidity and heat have to be maintained very precisely . The cage and all the environmental parts and necessities to maintain her in a healthy tropical space is about a $ 3000 investment ( she only cost $ 80 ) . If you have the means and the interest in such an animal , I do have some excellent designs for a humidification system that will manage a vented cage of this size.Here is a link to some specialty cages.http : //www.cagesbydesign.com/and here is the humidification system and some pictures of Pandora at home : http : //www.osagecollies.com/humid",0

I believe that immigration is good , necessary and as a country we should be thankful that people choose to come here . People bring labor , brains and so much more . As far as `` legal '' goes , it is always preferred that people do things legally , however , rules & laws change according to society 's needs . Perhaps the best answer here is to welcome the immigrant and change the rules as to what is legal/illegal .",0

"what is the purpose of the reverse stapling feature of a stapler ? On a hand stapler you have a silver metal anvil on the base of the stapler . This anvil is where the staple legs are formed either in an inward ( standard clinch ) or outward ( pinning ) fashion . If your staples are forming outward , this means that the anvil has been turned . To resolve , push the button under your anvil upward . This will raise the anvil , now rotate the anvil 180 degrees . This will change the position of the forming slots.Pinning ( the staple legs are formed outward ) is an old style of securing papers . You would be able to remove the staple without damaging your papers , and add additional papers . One draw-back to this style of fastening is that the staple leg is exposed and will catch on other objects .",0

Then after lobbing the top off a few times over the years ( think carefully , and take a deep breath for this ) buds for new 'runners ' seemed to spring up even lower down , and it has become more tree-like ; branching at the top .

"Where can I find an inexpensive but accurate hygrometer ? I want to be able to calibrate it and I need to spend under $ 50 . Nice question , most people unless they are weather buffs or cigar afficianados do n't know about hygrometers.Hygrometers measure relative humidity , or how damp or dry the air is.There are digital and analog hygrometers.Calibration ( adjusting for accuracy ) of both is difficult for various reasons . To calibrate a hygrometer means you need an accurate reference which provides accurate relative humidities over a range of air temperatures and pressures . It is not enough to calibrate a hygrometer at just one point . Most analog ( dial ) hygrometers only allow you to set one point by twiddling the fixed dial until the needle is pointing to the current moisture level.Most inexpensive digital hygrometers do not have calibration controls . The next price level up only allow you to set offset and scale - this is so-called `` linear calibration '' and it is not much better really.Depending on what you are measuring , one of the easiest ways to make your own accurate hygrometer is with two accurate but inexpensive lab thermometers . See the link on how to make a wet bulb hygrometer.Cheap hygrometers are easy to find on auction sites like ebay or yahoo , and using Googles Froogle search .",0

"how are sedimentary rocks formed ? ? how are sedimentary rocks formed ? ? Sedimentary rocks can be divided into two major informal groups , referred to as clastics ( or siliciclastics ) and carbonates . Clastic rocks are formed by erosion of other rocks , igneous , metamorphic and sedimentary . These 'clasts ' can be mud , silt , sand , cobbles , or boulders , and are transported by wind , water , or gravity and accumulate where they eventually are buried and pressure and temperature subject them to diagenesis , the process that makes them from unconsolidated clasts to one rock mass . Shale , sandstone , and conglomerate are examples of clastics.Carbonates can work much differently since they form primarily in the oceans . Many carbonates are made from reefs and other living organisms that grow in the ocean . As these organisms die and leave behind their carbonate skeletons , rocks are formed . Other carbonates are formed from small grains called ooids , small balls that form by precipitating out of sea water , possibly with the help of bacteria or algae . Some ocean algae even form carbonate 'mud ' that eventually becomes hard rock . Another unusual group of sedimentary rocks are called evaporites . These are rocks like gypsum and rock salt that are deposited by evaporation of water in confined basins . The most fascinating part about sedimentary rocks is that they have a past , each one tells a story .",0

"principle of subsidiarity whay does mean ? SubsidiaritySubsidiarity is the idea that matters should be handled by the lowest competent authority . The Oxford English Dictionary defines subsidiarity as the idea that a central authority should have a subsidiary function , performing only those tasks which can not be performed effectively at a more immediate or local level . The concept is applicable in the fields of government , political science , cybernetics , and the management of large organizations . Subsidiarity is , ideally or in principle , one of the features of federalism . The word subsidiarity is derived from the Latin word subsidiarius and has its origins in Catholic social teaching . It is found in several constitutions around the world ( see for example the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ) . It is presently best known as a fundamental principle of European Union law . According to this principle , the EU may only act ( i.e . make laws ) where member states agree that action of individual countries is insufficient . The principle was established in the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht , and is contained within the proposed new Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe . Catholic social teaching The principle of subsidiarity holds that government should undertake only those initiatives which exceed the capacity of individuals or private groups acting independently . The principle is based upon the autonomy and dignity of the human individual , and holds that all other forms of society , from the family to the state and the international order , should be in the service of the human person . Subsidiarity assumes that these human persons are by their nature social beings , and emphasizes the importance of small and intermediate-sized communities or institutions , like the family , the church , and voluntary associations , as mediating structures which empower individual action and link the individual to society as a whole . `` Positive subsidiarity '' , which is the ethical imperative for communal , institutional or governmental action to create the social conditions necessary to the full development of the individual , such as the right to work , decent housing , health care , etc. , is another important aspect of the subsidiarity principle . The principle of subsidiarity was developed in the encyclical Rerum Novarum of 1891 by Pope Leo XIII , as an attempt to articulate a middle course between the perceived excesses of laissez-faire capitalism on the one hand and the various forms of totalitarianism , which subordinate the individual to the state , on the other . The principle was further developed in Pope Pius XI 's encyclical Quadragesimo Anno of 1931 , and Economic Justice for All by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops . Quadragesimo Anno In the encyclical Quadragesimo Anno , Pope Pius specifically said at paragraphs 79 and 80 : 79 . As history abundantly proves , it is true that on account of changed conditions many things which were done by small associations in former times can not be done now save by large associations . Still , that most weighty principle , which can not be set aside or changed , remains fixed and unshaken in social philosophy : Just as it is gravely wrong to take from individuals what they can accomplish by their own initiative and industry and give it to the community , so also it is an injustice and at the same time a grave evil and disturbance of right order to assign to a greater and higher association what lesser and subordinate organizations can do . For every social activity ought of its very nature to furnish help to the members of the body social , and never destroy and absorb them.80 . The supreme authority of the State ought , therefore , to let subordinate groups handle matters and concerns of lesser importance , which would otherwise dissipate its efforts greatly . Thereby the State will more freely , powerfully , and effectively do all those things that belong to it alone because it alone can do them : directing , watching , urging , rest",0
"What is a `` chimera '' in terms of human reproduction ? Hint : has to do with prenatal twins . A chimera is an animal which has ( at least ) two different populations of cells , which are genetically distinct and which originated in different zygotes ( fertilized eggs ) . Chimeras are named after the mythological creature Chimera.Chimerism may occur naturally during pregnancy , when two non-identical twins combine in the womb , at a very early stage of development , to form a single organism . Such an organism is called a tetragametic chimera as it is formed from four gametes—two eggs and two sperm . As the organism develops , the resulting chimera can come to possess organs that have different sets of chromosomes . For example , the chimera may have a liver composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a kidney composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes . This has occurred in humans , though it is considered extremely rare , but since it can only be detected through DNA testing , which in itself is rare , it may be more common than currently believed . As of 2003 , there were about 30 human cases in the literature , according to New Scientist.In biological research , chimeras are artificially produced by mixing cells from two different organisms . This can result in the eventual development of an adult animal composed of cells from both donors , which may be of different species—for example , in 1984 a chimeric geep was produced by combining embryos from a goat and a sheep . A chicken with a quail 's brain has been produced by grafting portions of a quail embryo into a chicken embryo.In August 2003 , researchers at the Shanghai Second Medical University in China reported that they had successfully fused human skin cells and rabbit eggs to create the first human chimeric embryos . The embryos were allowed to develop for several days in a laboratory setting , then destroyed to harvest the resulting stem cells . Increasingly realizable projects using part-human , part-animal chimeras as living factories for producing cells or organs raise a host of ethical and safety issues.Chimeras should not be confused with hybrids , which are organisms formed from two gametes ( each from a different species ) which formed a single zygote . All cells in a hybrid originate from this single zygote . For example , a mule is a hybrid created from the sperm of a donkey and the egg of a horse.Chimeras should also not be confused with mosaics , which are organisms with genetically different cell types , but which again originate from a single zygote .",0

Probably not - the Republicans control the House and Senate at the moment . Clinton was impeached when the opposition party controlled Congress.Keep in mind that impeachment does not mean removal from office . Impeachment is simply the process of charging the President ( or other positions like Vice-President or judges ) with high crimes or misdemeanors . Then the Senate acts as judge and jury to try the person . If they are convicted by the Senate , they are removed from office . Any criminal charges would then involve another trial after the person is out of office .",0
"does outter space ever end ? ? The best guess today : no.In modern cosmology the topology of the universe appears to be open . `` Topology '' meaning the shape , although in the case of the universe to observe the shape we would have to exist in 4 spatial dimensions . Since we 're stuck in 3-dimensions we have to get by on analogies.The topology or shape of the universe is something which comes out of Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity . It depends primarily on the distribution of mass and energy in the universe . If the amount of mass-energy is more than a certain critical value then the universe would be `` closed . '' Basically the mass would curve space-time back onto itself . In a closed universe you could fly off in the direction of the north pole and ( after about 25 billion years ) and circle the universe to land on the south pole.If the amount of mass in the universe is less than this critical value then the topology of the universe is a bit more complex , but , to answer your question space would be infinite.Based on what we know today that is the case , space is infinite.However , we can not see an infinite universe . When we see things that are farther away we also see them from deeped in the past . A galaxy we see that is 10 billion light years distant is actually a view of what the galaxy looked like 10 billion years in the past.When we look farther in space , and thus earlier in the history of the universe , we eventually run into the microwave background . For the first 10,000 years or so after the Big Bang the universe was so dense that it was n't yet transparent . When the density dropped enough to be transparent then some of the light could escape for us to detect much later.However , while the universe is thought to be about 13 billion years old , we can actually see out a bit farther than that , I think around 20 billion light years , because the universe is expanding.What this boils down to is that there is a sort of `` wall '' beyond which we ca n't see . This wall corresponds to a time soon after the Big Bang . However , studies of the total mass-energy within the universe strongly suggest that it has an open topology - that it is infinite . ( Of course it is possible that this infinity will be refined when we have a better theory of how Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity play togther . String Theory is one way to combine these two . )",0

That 's seems morally legitimate . But today the success rate would be very low ; some of the failures would be horrible birth defects . So it would be unethical to attempt cloning a human today .

"Do they really have govt . grants anyone can get ? It is hard to find grants to start a business . Unlike the myths that some perpetuate , federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business . And yes , grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it , that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.Nonetheless , you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance ( CFDA ) http : //www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http : //www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants . Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.Even if you buy books on `` how to get grants '' or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has , albeit packaged differently . But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.Even SBA does NOT give out grants . From the SBA website http : //www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html '' The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses , although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs . ( See http : //www.sba.gov/financing for more information ) While SBA does offer some grant programs , these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management , technical , or financial assistance . These grants generally support non-profit organizations , intermediary lending institutions , and state and local governments . `` Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements ( e.g . minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant # 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities ( grant 59.043 Women 's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women 's business center that will train women entrepreneurs For private grants , you may want to check the Foundation Center 's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online . It 's a subscription based website ( $ 9.95 per month ) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for `` students , artists , academic researchers , libraries and financial aid offices . '' Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them , so I take it they also do n't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.http : //www.cfda.govhttp : //www.grants.govhttp : //gtionline.fdncenter.orghttp : //www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htmhttp : //www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html",0

"does muscle really weigh more than fat ? my daughter and i have a debate on this ? yes muscles weigh more than fat here is why ... .Muscle weighs more than fat because muscle cells that compose muscle are denser than fat cells . Why is this ? Because fat cell cytoplasm contains mostly oils ( lipids ) , whereas muscle cell cytoplasm contains mostly contractile proteins ( myosin and actin ) suspended in an aqueous ( watery ) environment . Lipids in general are less dense than water . You can prove this by mixing salad oil with water in a bottle and shaking it . Eventually , the oil will separate from the water and float to the top to form a lighter layer floating on top of the water . This lowered density of lipids make fatty tissue less heavy than muscle .",0
"Does debris affect a tornadoes wind speed ? The funnel of a tornado is actually clear . The only way we actually see the tornado is because of the debris that is circulating inside the funnel . The wind speed of the tornado will not increase because of debris . Debris can only be a hinderance to a tornado . To help you think about this , think about a very large piece of debris , lets say a mountain . Now while the mountain is not going to be picked up and tossed around like dirt , cows , trucks and some houses , it is still something that is getting in the way of a tornado . The mid-west experiences far more tornadoes than any other region . This is because they are uninhibited from forming . Basically the more you put in the way of the funnel the more difficult it will be for that funnel ( aka the tornado ) to form . To put it on a level that everyone can relate to , think of your toilet . When you flush the toilet the water starts to swirl . A funnel begins to appear in the water and eventually everything goes away . What happens if there is too much TP ( debris ) in the way ? The funnel never forms and you get a clog . I hope this helps .",0

"why is the Van Allen radiation belts have to surround to earth ? The Van Allen belts have very little to do with the earth 's core as the other answer suggested . They are believed to be created by the eath 's magnetic field interacting with charged particles known as solar wind . To the extent that we believe the earth 's core responsible for creating the earth 's magnetic field , I guess the earth 's core has some relevance . As the solar winds encounter the earth 's magnetic field , the radiation becomes trapped within the field . They are repelled from areas of stronger magnetic field where field lines converge . Two alternative hypotheses have been proposed . Possibly the Van Allen Belts are lefor over from the aurora , and another argument is that they are the result of volcanic activity of the earth . Some scientists beleive that they may have a beneficial effect on the planet providing some protection from solar wind , and that weakening them would harm both electronics and living organisms . there has been a proposal to reduce the charge of the belts , which are a hazard to satellites .",0
"Which is the most popular set of golf clubs , being purchased daily ? Not by the professionals , but the every day Joe Callaway has held the market share for years .

"Why is there no frost on a windy night ? In the winter , I often have to scrape my windshield in the morning . However , if the night before was windy , I do n't have a frost problem . It is more difficult for the moisture to accumulate on your windshield when it is windy . It takes some time for water to freeze when there is no wind at all so you can imagine how difficult it would be for water to accumulate and freeze when the wind is blowing .",0

Does anyone know anything about Solar water tanks ? Do they really save you money ? Solar water heaters are a very effecient way to reduce the heating cost of your water supply and your home temperature if the correct system is installed . Sunnier states provide a better benefit than those with long winters and cloudy skies but they will still operate effectively enough to be beneficial . The typical cost of a small system is recovered in 4-12 years depending on the purchase price and locale .,0

"Wht are the reqs for becoming a licensed psychiatrist in Florida ? Do you need a PhD or do you just need certification ? I 've just started looking into this as a career option & am sort of lost as to what to do or where to go for some complete answers . My intent , if at all possible , is to attend an online college , such as Capella . Thanks for the help ! In order to be a psychiatrist you need to attend an tradtional college/university and earn a BA or BS . Then you need to make sure that you have the required prerequisite classes for medical school which is inorganic chemistry I and II , organic chemistry I and II , physics I and II , biology I and II , 6-9 gredit hours of english/ english lit.. And some schools require that an applicant has calculus and 3-9 hours of behavioral sciences . And do n't forget to take the MCAT , have good recommendations , maybe volunteer at a hospital etc.. Then apply to medical school in which you will earn either a MD or DO depending on what program you want to be in . ( A psychiatrist has earned either an MD or DO . ) After you graduate from medical school , you need to enter a psychiatry residency ( I do n't know how long the residency program lasts , maybe 2-3 years ? ) . But , if you want to be a psychologist , you still need a BA or BS and then go to gradtuate school for psychology and earn a PhD . Be careful not to confuse a psychiatrist with a psychologist . A psychiatrist is a medical doctor ( M.D . or D.O . ) who writes out prescriptions and decides whether physical and mental disorders are from physical or psychological origins . A psychologist , however , is a doctor of philosophy ( Ph.D ) or a doctor of psychology ( Psy.D ) . Those are not medical degrees , and a psychologist can not prescribe medicine . But in order to become either one , you need to earn a B.A or B.S . first and have very good grades .",0

"what are the solutions for female hair lossing ? The most common type of hair loss seen in women is androgenetic alopecia , also known as female pattern alopecia . Alopecia means baldness , but just as in men , it does not have to be complete hair loss . This is seen as hair thinning predominantly over the top and front of the head . It affects approximately one-third of all susceptible women , but is most commonly seen after menopause Female pattern hair loss may begin as early as puberty . In these cases if there are signs of hormone imbalance , such as excess facial or body hair , a hormone evaluation should be done . Hormonal changes are a common cause of female hair loss . Many women do not realize that hair loss can occur after pregnancy or following discontinuation of birth control pills . It may also follow any sudden physical or psychological stress to the body . These types of hair loss are `` Telogen Effluvium '' and are usually temporary . It is important to remember that this hair loss may be delayed by up to three months following the change . Up to 8 months will be required for regrowth to be fully achieved.Treatment often starts with Rogaine ( topical minoxidil 2 % ) . Rogaine is the only FDA approved medication currently available for female pattern hair loss . The other hair loss medication , Propecia , just does n't work in women at all . Aldactone ( spironolactone ) pills help many women , especially whose hair loss starts before menopause but takes many months . Hormone replacement pills , such as Prempro , plus Aldactone are better after menopause . Experienced hair transplant surgeons can often achieve excellent results in women with the new follicular unit and minigraft techniques . You have to be a qualified candidate and have realistic expectations .",0

"Why do prisoners get to `` plea bargain '' for the crimes they chose to commit ?

'' The clerk at the grocery store who is being robbed does n't get to say , `` I do n't feel like getting a serious injury or dying right now , so instead of shooting me in the chest or head , can you just shoot me in the leg ? `` So why do the criminals get to `` bargain '' and get to have the charges for the crime they committed made to be less than what they actually did ? It 's a very provocative question with a very mundane answer . I do n't think it 's fair either , but prosecutors sometimes need information about someone further up the line . If a rapist , for instance , also works with and has knowledge of a white slavery ring and can give credible testimony that will put the leaders and their underlings in jail a prosecutor may offer a lighter sentence in order to stop a larger criminal enterprise.The other reasons are more disturbing . Sometimes a prosecutor 's office is so overloaded that accepting a plea bargain is a way to make a dent in the case load that the office is carrying . Ideally , that would only occur with non-violent , first time offenders , but sadly that is not always the case.Finally , some victims are reluctant to testify or are so traumatized by the crime committed against them that they are unable to testify well and the D.A . 's office does n't want to risk an acquital . In this same vein are cases that can mount a credible reasonable doubt defense and cases where the evidence is weak or tainted.It a'int perfect , but its a better system than most others .",0

"How to deal with my 10 yrs old daughter that is always late and seems she does n't understand that time goes by Some people do not have good concepts of time regardless of what others tell them . It might be in part due to ADD or some other cognitive issue or that they might become so present in each moment that they are unable to think about anything else mundane and necessary such as time and that they have to conform to it 's limits . ADD can have bizarre opposites like not being aware of or focused enough to notice something like time , but then being so focused on what you 're doing that you are unaware of time ... Contrary but it occurs . But please do n't rush to drugs if you find they have ADD . Drugs are n't always the answer and can have horrible side effects , ritalin is just pharmaceutical speed . Awareness and education and remaining involved in an activity they love is the best bet for ADD-like issues.Talk to her nicely about it . Explain that unfortunately in this modern world , one we do n't have much of a choice about living in unless we want to live in the woods , have to conform to a little to be able to get along and function well in . Help her understand what the consequences of time management are about and the downfalls of it to herself and to others . Nicely of course . No pressure but engage her conscience so that she feels responsible for the affect she has upon another person when she is late . You can also enlist tools such as a large clock that she can understand with hands/dials or digital numbers . Help her practice what time she begins something , how long she will be at it and then when she will stop that activity to begin another ... etc . Or a timer that she can set for a distinct amount of time so that when it goes off she knows she has something she has to get ready for next and allows her time to plan . Ask her what her beliefs are about time and her responsibility to others is in regards to being on time . Ask her what 's going on , engage her opinion even if she has to figure it out as you go . It will help her become conscious of the situation beyond your frustration and into her role in it.Look into different methods in the educational department or section for kids with learning disabilities ( even if she does n't have one ) . The resources are good and you can use them to your advantage , like I said even if she does n't have one . Good luck !",0

"Alabama and education for children with pdd-nos / Autism ? I assume you are asking about what education is available for children with the disorder in Alabama . I am not familiar with Alabama 's resources but as a parent of a profoundly mentally challenged child , I will tell you what I do know . The best place to start is ask your pediatrician about resources . The mental health facility is a very good place to start . Depending on the child 's age , your area may have something available like First Steps , which is an early intervention service for children with developmental delays available for children up to 3 years old . First Steps was wonderful for my daughter . After she turned 3 , we were referred to a state-run facility that basically gave us a case manager and helped to identify the special needs for our child but after 3 years with them , we still have not been able to actually RECEIVE services because the waiting list is so long , then they go through freezes . I hope your state is not as backed up as ours is . As far as education , public schools are required to provide an education to special needs children , per the Americans with Disabilities Act . The special needs child is given an IEP ( individualed education plan ) so that the child is taught what is appropriate for his/her abilities . The parent 's involvement and input in the IEP is very important . If you do not agree with the IEP , you can change it . Individuals with Disabilities Education Act : The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) ( formerly called P.L . 94-142 or the Education for all Handicapped Children Act of 1975 ) requires public schools to make available to all eligible children with disabilities a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment appropriate to their individual needs.IDEA requires public school systems to develop appropriate Individualized Education Programs ( IEP 's ) for each child . The specific special education and related services outlined in each IEP reflect the individualized needs of each student.IDEA also mandates that particular procedures be followed in the development of the IEP . Each student 's IEP must be developed by a team of knowledgeable persons and must be at least reviewed annually . The team includes the child 's teacher ; the parents , subject to certain limited exceptions ; the child , if determined appropriate ; an agency representative who is qualified to provide or supervise the provision of special education ; and other individuals at the parents ' or agency 's discretion.If parents disagree with the proposed IEP , they can request a due process hearing and a review from the State educational agency if applicable in that state . They also can appeal the State agency 's decision to State or Federal court . For more information , contact : Office of Special Education ProgramsOffice of Special Education and Rehabilitative ServicesU.S . Department of Education400 Maryland Avenue , S.W.Washington , D.C. 20202-7100I hope this helps . I know how hard it is with a special needs child and I wish you the best .

It can also obviously aid them in developing more quickly in whatever other field of interest they may have.The obvious challenge is to create software that mimics games while teaching kids important concepts . Hand/eye coordination is n't enough ; they have to start to use their minds in a more critical and creative fashion . The software that can do that will have really achieved something for them , as well as for the rest of us .",0

"What some things to say to a girl on the phone or how to start off a Conversation ? Im talkin bout a girl I just met ! got this in a daily emailAs far as starting conversations with women , here are a few ideas for you ... First of all , you must realize that your bodylanguage is more important than the words you use.Wherever you are , and whatever the situation , youMUST remember that your composure and bodylanguage are the keys . I 've watched a lot of guys approach a LOT ofwomen in my day . And I can usually tell within thefirst few SECONDS if the guy knows what he 's doingwith women ... and if he 's going to be successful . Most guys use submissive , apologetic bodylanguage and voice tones ... they almost look as ifthey 're pleading with a woman to give themapproval and that they 're nervous and selfconscious about the whole event . In other words , most guys come across asWUSSIES when they first approach women . On the other hand , the guys I know who are themost successful with women are the opposite . They 're totally cool , calm , and collected . Theyoften approach a woman and begin the conversationlike they would with an old friend . There is no apologetic body language , and thereare no signs of insecurity . They are n't there to find out if the woman isgoing to give them some approval ... on thecontrary , they are trying to find out if the womanmeets THEIR standards . Think about how you 'd act if you were onlyinterested in finding out if she 's the kind ofexceptional woman that you 're interested ingetting to know better , instead of being concernedabout whether or not she 's going to like you ... big shift , is n't it ? Now , here 's some homework for you : Sit down and think carefully about the mostcommon situations you find yourself in where yousee women that you 'd like to meet and talk to . Think about what 's going on in their minds , where they 're going , what they 've just done ... andwhat they 're about to do . Think about how they'reprobably feeling . Now , come up with 10 different ways that youcould start a conversation in this situation.Remember that YOU 'RE the one who is trying tofigure out if SHE is the kind of woman you 'd liketo get to know better . Once you 've come up with 10 good ones , pickyour favorite , and mentally rehearse it . I realize that I 'm asking you to do some workhere , but it 's sooooo worth it . I 'm going to give you one more hint ... Most of the guys I know who are great withwomen use the simplest of simple conversationstarters . `` Hi . '' `` What are you drinking ? '' `` Hi , are you from around here ? '' ... I realize that these sound simple , and theyare . But they 're so simple that they 're DISARMING.They do n't come across as canned `` pick up lines '' , and they help you figure out very quickly if thewoman you 're talking to is friendly . And remember , relaxed body language is Key ! the subject was how to apporach women",0

However , I think this is one of the least enforced laws nationwide until parties and stuff get involved . A drink with your parents at dinner wont get looked at twice",0

"is this bird flu REALLY that dangerous ? or just a fad ? i mean ... u hear researchers are terrified by 3 deaths in one country 4 in another . malaria kills millions especially in africa . The bird flu is n't really dangerous now , but it has potential to become a serious threat . The main problem with bird flu is its high resistance to antibiotics . And everytime one of those few people with it are treated , there is the chance that new strains resistant to that treatment will develop . The main difference between bird flu and malaria is that we generally have malaria isolated in africa , with few exceptions , where as we dont really know how far bird flu has spread . There 's also vaccines to prevent malaria and drugs to treat it.Also , bird flu hits and kills a person very fast.. typically wthin 3-4 days .

Fathers are allowed to take paternity leave so I do n't think you can get fired . But , I am not sure about that . You can check with your state 's labor dept . to confirm this . Your boss might not like the fact that you will need 4 days off for paternity leave especially since you are a relatively new employee . You will probably not get paid since you most likely have n't accrued sick or vacation time . You should give your boss as much advance notice as you can so he can plan accordingly . If you work for a company that has a Human Resources Dept . you might want to check with them to see how many days you can take ( it may be more than 4 ) and whether you have any sick time that would pay you while your out . You can also go to www.laborlawtalk.com and see if you can get an answer to your paternity leave questions .",0

For example , in most regions of the United States eggs are generally white , while in the northeast of that country , and in the United Kingdom eggs are generally light-brown . These habits may be associated with perceptions of greater purity in white-shelled eggs or greater wholesomeness in brown-shelled eggs",0

Understand how the real world works- The more quickly information moves , the more value it has.The same fact is true for supply chain management.- Being able to execute quickly can remove the need toforecast.- Material will expand to fill the space provided.3 . Have a complete integrated system– A complete system includes both planning and executionmanagement.– Plan will change but to fail to plan in planning to fail.– Changes and variability are expected events . The morequickly an enterprise can react , the less cost is incurred by theoperation.– System effectiveness is inversely proportional to thecomplexity.4 . Accurate data- Without accurate data , the best hardware and software will benothing but a big money pit and provide no return oninvestment.5 . Manage cycle time– Cycle time is the amount of time that elapses between materialentering and exiting a production facility.– Do not release orders to the floor unless all material and capacity isavailable to run it.6 . Eliminate nonvalue-added activity- It is not say that every implementation should embrace “ industrybest practices ” if these processes do not help the enterprise achieveits goals.- Keep implementation costs down rather than driving higher returnon investment.- Eliminating nonvalue-added activity means that one shouldn ’ tautomate bad process.7 .

"Why do white men like asian chicks so much ? This is probably not the first time you come across this phenomenon . These days , you see a great number of white men wanting to be with asian chicks other than gals of other races . What qualities about asian chicks that white men like about ? Why do asian chicks want to be with white men ? An input from both male and female would be good ! Men believe ( rightly or wrongly ) that an Asian girl will be more submissive or docile . They stereotype Asian women in that way based upon what they see in movies or based upon what they hear goes on in Asia . Some Asian women are attracted to white men because they want someone who does n't treat them as subserviant . They want to be treated as an equal . See what can go wrong in this picture ? Obviously many relationships between Asians and westerners work just fine , but if someone is just trying to attract `` any Asian '' or `` any white guy '' , there could be a problem . As far as physical attraction , perhaps some are attracted by the more youthful appearance , but some may also be attracted by the fact that in general , Asians tend to be slimmer than western women . Many guys find that attractive . Guys look at a woman 's mother for a clue at what his girl may look like in the future . Asian parents tend to be slimmer than western parents . There is some male input for you .",0

Saltpeter can cause relaxation of involuntary muscle fiber ( for which reason it 's used to treat asthma ) and it 's occasionally prescribed to lower body temperature in cases of fever . From there it 's not much of a leap to think that `` niter , '' as it was called in the old days , might cure `` sexual fever , '' and in fact a few doctors urged it for that purpose centuries ago .

"If you were to die tonight , where will you spend eternity ? Every one spends time preparing for their lives here on earth . We focus on making money , which of course we need to pay bills and live with some kind of security . Yet for some , money is all they ever think about- and they become greedy and greediness leads to selfishness and people stop caring about what really matters . We stop caring about how precious life is . How God gave us the air we breathe and the ability to be creative and work towards building relationships with others and with God our creator . When we become greedy we lose out because our whole life is spent grabbing wealth so we can get ahead . Ahead for what ? New house , more cars , more hedonistic pleasures to fulfill the emptiness we really feel inside . The Bible says , `` money is the root of all evil . '' When you look around at all the evil in the world it most likely can be traced back to greed . We ca n't take it with us when we go . We came into the world naked and we 'll go out that way . Think about it ! What 's important ? I plan on spending eternity in Heaven with my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ ! You are right that the Bible says that Money is the root of all Evil and you cant take it with you ! People shouldnt take for granted that they are going to be here tomorrow..b/c NONE of us are Promised tomorrow or even the next minute or second . Take the time to Thank GOD when you open your eyes and you can put your feet on the floor ! And for those ppl who are lost and dont have Jesus Christ , Do n't keep putting it off to accept him into your life , b/c like I said NONE OF US are PROMISED the next sec , minute or tomorrow ! And I 'm sure you do n't want to burn for eternity ! GOD BLESS all of YOU ! With love in the LORD , ME !",0

"How is NAMASTE pronounced ? I read about it when sukhjiwansekhon asked what it meant and I really like the word and would like to use it . NAMASTE IS A HINDI WORD ( LANGUAGE USED IN HINDI ) '' Namaste '' is sometimes used in the context of practicing Yoga as a greeting or goodbye , generally taken as an expression of good will . Namaste is sometimes mis-interpreted as a greeting associated with Yoga only , but it is much more widely used than that in South Asia , particularly in greeting elders . Moreover , it is used throughout Asia , especially in the context of Buddhism or Buddhist cultures , even though it is known by different names in some languages.Namaste is a Hindi word , and hence has widespread use in North India where Hindi and its dialects are the languages spoken . Gassho is the term used in Japanese contexts for the hand-gesture , and for the wider bowing , as a whole . In Thailand , the guesture is known as wai ( pronounced `` why '' with a rising tone ) .In some parts of India ( for example , Punjabi-speaking areas ) , Namaste is used only to greet Hindus . The proper greeting for Muslims and Sikhs being Assalamu Alaikum and Sat Sri Akaal respectively .",0

And I 'm not sure how you designate areas of the universe as `` quadrants '' , or assign directions for them .

"im doing a project , does anyone know if Could a World Of Swimmers Raise The Sea Level ? ? ? ? ? plz answer ? I believe that you can simplify the problem with a few assumptions . First , it should not matter how deep the ocean is , raising sea level is a surface effect . Add a turkey to pots filled to the top with water and push it under and the same amount of water will spill regardless of how large the pots are . However , push the turkey under in partially filled pots and the level will rise more in a `` just right '' pot than one twice as large in surface area.Most people can just barely float or sink depending on fat content , so it is justified on average to assume a person will exactly displace their weight in water or their volume in water . Weight will be easier.You must select a size for the population and then calculate an averasge weight for babies , children , men and women . You could estimate the average weight of a typical family perhaps . You only need to show your calculations and reasons.Next you need to assume whether your population is swimming under water ( most displacement ) or with heads and arms above water ( least displacement ) . Most displacement under water will be easier , especially because some float better in salty sea water.Finally , you need to estimate the weight of the entire population and convert that to cubic feet of water where water weighs 62.4 lbs per cubic feet . Divide that by the square feet of surface area of all the oceans and seas and you will have the rise in sea level , to whatever decimal places you chose . Good luck .",0
"why do people who get charged with drugs get more time than a person who comitted a sexual crimewith a child ? people who comitte a sexual offense with a child should be watched 24-7 , or should not be able to see freedom .

I think it 's absolutely absurd that someone who actually killed someone could theoretically get less time than most people do for dealing drugs .",0
"Why ca n't conservatives really learn to conserve more ? seems most conservatives are only interested in conserving a wasteful greedy life-style ... If you are talking about conserving energy - this will not solve the energy problem . It 's only part of the solution . What really solves the problem is drilling and refining our own sources of energy off of our coasts and in ANWR - but that wo n't happen because tree hugging pus*y liberals like yourself would rather block domestic energy production and then whine about gas prices being too high . That 's why there has n't been an oil refinery built in this country for over 30 years . That 's why they have brownouts in California . All because of the environmental movement and their hatred of Capitalism . Raising the supply of energy is a sure fire way to make sure we never run out.This is true of ANY commodity . Let 's take Coca Cola for example . The reason a 12oz can of Coke only costs 75 cents from a vending machine is because that is the price that the market will bear . Now , close every Coca-Cola bottling plant in the country except one and keep the same amount of vending machines - what do you think would happen to the price ? It would skyrocket because there would n't be enough Coke to fill the vending machine demand.On the other hand , if you openend up Coca-Cola bottling plants on every steet corner in America - there would be so much Coke available that the price would plummet because they would have more Coca-Cola than vending machines to dispense them.The same would be true whether you are talking about energy , Coca-Cola , steel , guns , butter or newspapers.Instead of spouting off from your a $ $ , maybe you should learn some Economic facts first .",0

"While teaching grammar to students of English , are we allowed to use their mother tongue ? or English alone ? That 's a good question . Most countries that employ native English speakers to teach English do NOT want the teachers to speak anything but English . This can be beneficial for the students because they are literally flooded with English and have no resort but to learn as the days go by . It is akin to learning through immersion - which , from experience I can say is the best and easiest way to learn a language . If it 's all you hear all day long , you pick it up fast.However , it can be very difficult and daunting for students to hear only a language they have n't yet learned . When I taught English in Thailand , I could only speak English to them because I had n't yet learned Thai . But once I had enough Thai under my belt to speak to the students in their own language , it made it a LOT easier to make them understand the English I was trying to teach.So there are advantages and disadvantages to both ways . Just do your best and see what works .",0

Does he have any hobbies , things he likes to do ? If so , encourage him to do them to help relax . Does he workout ? I know for me , going and doing a good workout or hitting the punching bag for a while will get rid of those feelings when I am angry.Is he insecure about something ? Does he think he is too short , too fat , too thin , etc ... ? Maybe he is hot-tempered because of this . Try to encourage him and point out his good traits . Do you take care of him at home ( sexually ) ? This caused a lot of problems in my marriage when we would n't have sex or cuddle for months at a time . Husbands are much happier when they are satisfied sexually .

"does anyone think that literature effects everyone 's everyday life ? I 'm sure many including myself will agree on the fact that literature affects one 's life immensely . Good literature is not only a good sense of entertainment but also refines one 's vocabulary and personality . They even add to knowledge as well as affect the views of a person . A person who is a fanatic of Sherlock Holmes will learn to analyse things deeply and will develop skills of perception and systematic thinking.Many people also picture themselves as one of the characters . It helps them to overcome troubles by being inspired . A good background in literature helps you learn how thinks were in the past , analyse the present and then shape the future . There is a lot to learn fom Literature and believe me it is worth the time to read some Book .",0
"I wake up after sleeping with a stiff/paralyzed arm ? This only happens on occasion , but to my right arm it takes me about 10-20 seconds to regain control in my hand , maybe its how I sleep on that side ? ? ? Really good chance that your sleeping style could have something to do with it . Try and notice if it may occurr more when your upper arm is raised greater than or equal to 90 degrees ( above the shoulder ) . It is a symptom of shoulder impingement syndrome where the nerves that run through the sub-acromial space are compressed within this small cavity , causing the parasthesia that you are experiencing .

"why should aperson lose their job for forgeetting to turn in money that they are told to keep in their pockets My daughter was a very dedicated employee at Dayton International airport , went to work on her off days just to help out , did whatever her job duties call for her to do , a very repectful young lady that spent six year in the US Army . Nine months in Iraq . She was fired from the airport because they are told to keep money that they collect from customer in their pocket until the end of the day , instead of having a cash box for them to put the money in as soon as they collect it . She forgot she had the money in her pocket three times and took the money home ; therefore they fired her . Although she took the money back each time . She had been working there for one year and that is all they could find to fire her for . She really need her job she have a 4 year old daughter that she is raising . She have bills each month . it 's a shame when young people choose to get out and work and not be on public assistant to get fired for something like that . it 's hard to find jobs . I think it 's sad that your daughter lost her job at the aiport , she sounded like a very dedicated employee willing to go the extra mile even on her days off . But it is probably best she is no longer there because what you are describing here is that she was probably long past exhaustion each time she accidentally took the money home , although I am certain the airport did n't consider this when they decided to fire her.On the WHY part of your question : When she first was employeed by the airport she probably signed an agreement of `` if I mishandle money in any way that is n't in agreement with the airports rules , I understand that is grounds for dismissal '' If she agreed to these terms and broke them , is was their call to be understanding or not . They were 2 times before , but when they see a pattern of it , they are less likely to trust their money is safe . They will protect themsevles before protecting her.I agree they should n't make it so easy to leave your shift without turning the money in first . Just like with waiters and waitresses , or bartenders that most of the time must carry change on them , if the airport had an end shift report to do before each employee was allowed to leave , then it could all be resolved . I do n't know any waiters or waitresses that can leave for the day without giving the company their money first , along with reporting their tipped earnings for the day.Her honesty in giving the money back is something to be proud of , and she should n't hold bad memories against the airport for their descision . She made a mistake , we all do that once in a while . She 'll find another job , and she will have this experience to learn from .",0

"What exactly is antimatter ? Howmuch of it has been produced till today ? Antimatter or contra-terrene matter is matter that is composed of the antiparticles of those that constitute normal matter . If a particle and its antiparticle come in contact with each other , the two annihilate and produce a burst of energy , which results in the production of other particles and antiparticles or electromagnetic radiation . In these reactions , rest mass is not conserved , although ( as in any other reaction ) energy ( E=mc² ) is conserved.Scientists in 1995 succeeded in producing antiatoms of hydrogen , and also antideuteron nuclei , made out of an antiproton and an antineutron , but no antiatom more complex than antideuterium has been created yet . In principle , antiatoms of any element could be built from readily available sources of antiparticles . Such antiatoms would have exactly the same properties as their normal-matter counterparts . The production of antielements in bulk quantities seems unlikely to ever become achievable , however.Positrons and antiprotons can individually be stored in a device called a Penning trap , which uses a combination of magnetic field and electric fields to hold charged particles in a vacuum . Two international collaborations , ATRAP and ATHENA , used these devices to store thousands of slowly moving antihydrogen atoms in 2002 . It is the goal of these collaborations to probe the energy level structure of antihydrogen to compare it with that of hydrogen as a test of the CPT theorem . One way to do this is to confine the antiatoms in an inhomogenous magnetic field ( one can not use electric fields since the antiatoms are neutral ) and interrogate them with lasers . If the anti-atoms have too much kinetic energy they will be able to escape the magnetic trap , and it is therefore essential that the anti-atoms be produced with as little energy as possible . This is the key difference between the antihydrogen that ATRAP and ATHENA produced , which was made at very low temperatures , and the antihydrogen produced in 1995 which was moving at a speed close to the speed of light.Antimatter/matter reactions have practical applications in medical imaging , such as positron emission tomography ( PET ) . In some kinds of beta decay , a nuclide loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron ( in the same event , a proton becomes a neutron , and neutrinos are also given off ) . Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a cyclotron and are widely generated for medical use.Antiparticles are created everywhere in the universe where high-energy particle collisions take place , such as in the center of our galaxy , but none has been detected that is residual from the Big Bang , as most normal matter is . [ 1 ] The unequal distribution between matter and antimatter in the universe has long been a mystery . The solution likely lies in the violation of CP-symmetry by the laws of nature ; see baryogenesis.how much produced it is on and on and on",0

"interfaith marriage ? How can a devoted Catholic woman overcome restrictions in the bible ( which she believes in ) to marry a non-Christian ? I suppose today 's society is n't as tribal as the past societies or the ones you still see in 3rd world countries where women were nothing but chattel.Based on that it 's quite simple today to find someone you love having most of the qualities you desire - yes , even in the religious sense.A devout Catholic women should be chaste and so must her husband . Both should have a pure state of mind and believe in God.There are many non-Christians who are n't Christians or Catholics but still have a sense of God , but are not ready to make a huge commitment to the Christian or Catholic faith if they 're not ready yet.Many non-Christians are chaste , have pure , good hearts and I 'm sure we all know not all Christians are better than non-Christians . I 've met alot of non-Christians with hearts of gold that 'd put many hollow-faithed and judgemental Christians to great shame if they were put together.It maybe a matter of time before this person actually decides to take God and Christ into his or her heart , or through the spouse 's good conduct and deep faith , decide that , yes , the children are better off having a religion then just skulking around in the wide open space looking for something.So , I do n't think we should judge non-Christians harshly - unless as individuals they have less-than-honourable conduct and character . It takes a lot of love , effort , acceptance and faith in God , as well as time , for the spouse to realise that yes , I want to accept Christ in my life.And of course , when the children come their religious beliefs will form naturally in the family .",0

hair products and skin prouducts ? wat r the best hair products 2 use 2 get my hair thick again its already long and wat about skin i have some littelblack dots from bumps and i need them 2 go way and dont like proactive As far as skin goes : Try the Mary Kay skin care line with customized skin care products for acne . The best thing to with your skin is always to keep it clean as well as treating breakouts . This helps prevent breakouts . There are five steps to basic skin care : 1 . Cleanse2 . Exfoliate3 . Tone/Freshen4 . Moisturize5 . ProtectThe Mary Kay 3 in 1 cleanser can do the first three steps in one . The fifth step is protect . You want to use an oil free foundation which our formulas for dry normal combo and oily skin are all oil free . When your skin is protected with foundation you can wash off the impurities that your skin catches in the air . The foundation catches the irritants and impurities instead of them getting into your pores causing further breakouts . Mary Kay is satisfaction guaranteed . So if you try it and it doesnt work for you you can get different products or your money back . Also it is so important that when you are using skin care you use one line be it Mary Kay or Avon or a Walmart brand . They are formulated to work with one another . Mixing products not designed to work together can cause reactions in some people . ; ) To even out skin tone you of course need to keep your skin exfoliated but also use a solution like our day and night solution . The day solution has SPF 25 in it and the Night Solution has Vitamin A and E and more in them . These collagen inducing products help to tighten and firm the skin as well as even out tone . You can add in our Microdermabrasion once or twice a week to totally exfoliate and remove dead skin . The second step of our microderm set will return your skin to its proper PH balance so you will not be rough or dry afterwards . I reccomend using products as follows but all skin care must be customized for an individual.Timewise 3 in 1 Cleanser ( customized for skin type ) Timewise Day Solution ( at night use Night Solution ) Timewise Moisturizer ( customized for skin type ) Timewise Firming Eye creamAdditional moisturizers if needed ( intense for dry spots etc ) Foundation ( customized for skin type and shade ) Color products ( use all oil free and non-comedogenic ) Hope this was helpful ! !

"How does temperature affect the taste of food and drink ? For example , white wine , tap water , Cointreau , lager and even chocolate taste much better cold . On the other hand , tea , coffee and brandy , as well as most cooked meals , taste much better warm or hot . English beer and red wine are better at room or cellar temperature . Why ? Heat amplifies smell , and most of `` taste '' is actually based on smell . Without smell , coffee and chocolate would just be bitter anf gross . So aromatic things smell more strongly . Cold also delays the taste of things , so cold chocolate probably loses enough of the bitterness by being cold , while retaining enough aroma , such that that might make it better . Of course , if you like your chocolate bitter ( like I do ) you wo n't prefer it cold for taste reasons . I think cold chocolate -- especially dark chocolate -- is too tasteless.Occasionally there is a matter of texture as well . With chocolate , for instance , I 'd dispute that it tastes better cold , but it is certainly less melty . With beer/lager/ale , heat can make it go flat , which affects its taste , but with liquor , the intense burn of the alcohol makes the burn worse . Aromatic liquors like brandy/cognac and whiskey/scotch are heated to allow the aromas to be stronger , but really , most all alcohol is innately gross , and is an acquired taste -- so people tend to learn to like them in particular ways , but I do n't think any of it is particularly innate . Cognac , scotch , and fine wine all take years to `` learn '' to appreciate .",0

( opinion ) -Economy has been down for quite some time -Is much less liked internationally ( and domestically too ) They 've both done good things , I think too.CLINTON - -Economy flurished -US well respected in worldBUSH - -Willing to do what it takes to keep America safe . ( By attacking Afghanistan , something Clinton would n't do with previous attacks . ) -Has GREATLY increased free trade in the western hemisphere ( although there are some farmers in Mexico and other S.American places that say free trade hurts them . ) Overall , I think that both presidents did the best they could and that their actions ( especially Bush 's ) are more of a response to circumstances outside their control .

Think about it : to freeze water , you need to take energy away from the water , right ? ( You lower the temperature , which is the same thing as taking energy away . Imagine sucking energy away from water to make it freeze . ) So , by definition , freezing water is exothermic . It gives off energy . Conversely , the melting of water is endothermic ; you need to give ice energy in order for it to melt . I know it can get confusing because when you touch ice , it 's cold , so you might think that freezing is endothermic , but it 's not . If you think about it , ice in your hand is taking away energy from your hand in order for it to melt ( that 's why it feels cold ) , so melting is endothermic , making freezing exothermic .",0

"What 's the best diet to loose weith in 1 month ? ? i need to loose some weith ! Any minding of the fat & calories , coupled with adequate exercise , will help you drop a little something.Increase your activity . Start walking , jogging , or biking for 30-60 minutes at least 3 or 4 times a week.Drink like a camel . I try to drink about 15 glasses of water a day , plus coffee ( the extra water is to counter the caffeine dehydration ) .Use a calorie-free sweetener instead of sugar . Try to be active in the morning , and try to eat breakfast . Both will kick-start your metabolism.Get adequate sleep.If you 're a carb addict like me ( bread , pasta , etc . ) , opt for whole grains . I eat whole grain cheerios for breakfast , and use 1 % milk . 1-3 times a day , I eat buttered vegetables ( California or Italian Style frozen vegetable mix from Wal-Mart : 25 calories per serving ) .If you like kool-aid or other sweet drinks , try fruit2o ( fruity water ) , Propel ( fruity water by gatorade ) , or CRYSTAL LIGHT drink mixes . I once traded in my kool-aid for crystal light while I was pregnant , and did n't gain any weight between visits with my doctor.If you want a little help , go invest in a good OTC diet pill like TrimSPA or Propolene . I do n't recommend Stackers , but that 's only because I do n't know many people who can take stimulants the way I do . DO NOT take more than the recommended dosage , and do n't take them too late in the day , or you wo n't sleep.And last ... COMMIT to changing your lifestyle , NOT just dropping a few pounds for whatever happens in a month , and thinking it 's going to be forever . If you can not commit , then do not complain .",0

"Earth is a phenomena and a woman too is a phenomena .Man is part of this phenomena . Why GOD is called HE ? read Concept of God has emerged in the mankind after being born and based on the behaviour pattern of human beings alone.Religions have unable to convey the essence and existance of GOD which could unite every human being without doubts.Religions have created more doubts . However many followers , which kept dividing in numbers , according to technical interpretations , and , became politicl force.Reality of the ABSOLUTE got lost.Earth lost importance , motherhood too lost significance.What is reality ? A spermis a phenomena but is part of of a phenomena called Ovum.Mensurations periods of a woman are like monsoon periods on Earth which prepares itself for creating life all arround .Woman sheds her blood and earth the essence of blood , water.In stead of calling let us save this Earth , let Us say O ! mother Earth accept us with LOVE in YOUR WOMB .The GOD inside this phenomena will listen to your prayers .God is experienced in every mode of nature and not outside it as propagated by religion God is commonly referred to in the masculine sense because of the relationship that primarily judaism based religions wished to portray between god and mankind . God the Father , because at the time all the ancient religious texts for these religions were written a family was dominated by the father and rather than using the metaphor of the mother , which would imply at the time that there was some other superior to the God figure , they used a masculine term . This term has persisted due to a continuation of male dominance in society and through the institution of tradition which is now so ancient that many believe it would be heresy to alter it today . It is true that the relationship that many today share with god is much better described as female , but this too stems from the feminization of 'soft ' concepts such as love and procreation . Consequently calling God male or female is 100 % related to culture and I would like to answer your question with a question . Why try to personify god as male or female ? If you follow western society 's modern beleif that male and female are equal , or the more radical belief that there is no definite male or female but shades of gender ( see transgender ) , and if gender serves the sole function of procreation through sexual intercourse why attempt to place the all powerful being that is God within the restraints of a single gender . God does not need to procreate through sexuality as God is capable of creation without thought or effort . So , why call God she ? Why not just understand that God is God regardless of name or gender .",0

"how does one learn to swim well ? I can manage to go swim about 20 mtrs but i am exhausted and cant go any further . Can someone point me to good online swimming lessons and techniques for amateurs . If you are trying to swim freestyle ( crawl ) , switch to an easier stroke , like the sidestroke while you increase your endurance . If you can only swim 20m , then swim 20m , rest , and swim 20m again . Repeat that process . You can time your rests and shorten your rests as you get stronger and increase the number of repititions you do each session . After a while , push yourself to do 40m between stops , then 60 , etc.In my experience , if you can work up to 400m without stopping , you will be past the point where you are struggling in the water.It might be a good idea to have someone look at your stroke and tell you what needs correcting . If you are struggling to make 20m . there are probably a lot of things that you can do to make your stroke more efficient . Find out what they are and work on correcting one thing at a time . Find someone who 's swimming laps when you are at pool , someone who 's stroke looks good , and ask them to look at your stroke .

"When I read Isaiah 53 , I see the saving death of Jesus perfectly described there . Why do n't the Jews see Him ? It is not that the Jews are blind , it is that Christians see the Hebrew Scriptures through Jesus-colored glasses . Since they read the Christian 's New Testament first , then the TaNaCH , they see the TaNaCH through the lens of Christianity . If read on its own , with no knowledge of , or belief in , Christianity , the Hebrew Scriptures would not be seen as being about Jesus.Jews dont see the Christian interpretation in Isaiah 53 , because it contradicts what the Hebrew Scriptures , the Bible says , clearly and consistently , in at least 3 places : In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself as an atonement for the sins of the people . To be written out of God 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . God 's response was `` No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : '' Exodus 32:30-35And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Eternal ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Eternal , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Eternal said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book ... nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the father . Every man must die for his own sin.The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for God 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and God will forgive us . Nowhere in this chapter does it say that we have to have a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins.Ezekiel 18:1-4 ; 20-24 ; 26-27 ... ..Behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul that sinneth , it shall die ... .The soul that sinneth , it shall die . The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father , neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son : the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him , and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him . But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die . All his transgressions that he hath committed , they shall not be mentioned unto him : in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live . Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die ? saith the Eternal God : and not that he should return from his ways , and live ? So , either Deuteronomy 24:16 , `` Every man must die for his own sin '' does not mean that 'every man must die for his own sin , ' and the Christian interpretation of Isaiah 53 is correct , or the Christian interpretation of Isaiah 53 is not correct , and Deuteronomy 24:16 , 'Every man must die for his own sins ' means exactly what it says.Furthermore , Jews read Isaiah up to ( and including Isaiah 53 ) and Isaiah repeatedly refers specifically to the Jews as Gd 's servant . Read Isaiah 41:8 ; Isaiah 44:21 ; Isaiah 45:4 ; Isaiah 49:3 ; Isaiah 44:1 ; Isaiah 48:20 and Isaiah 49:7 Lets concentrate on Isaiah 43:10 : :Isaiah 43:10 `` You are my witnesses , saith the Etrnl , and my servant whom I have chosen : that ye may know and believe me , and understand that I am he : before me there was no Gd formed , neither shall there be after me .

"How 's apoptosis related to the development of the fingers ? the way apoptosis make the fingers form ( scroll to `` > > > > > > '' ) For every cell , there is a time to live and a time to die . There are two ways in which cells die : They are killed by injurious agents . They are induced to commit suicide.Death by injuryCells that are damaged by injury , such as by mechanical damage exposure to toxic chemicalsundergo a characteristic series of changes : They ( and their organelles like mitochondria ) swell ( because the ability of the plasma membrane to control the passage of ions and water is disrupted ) . The cell contents leak out , leading to inflammation of surrounding tissues.Death by suicideCells that are induced to commit suicide : shrink ; develop bubble-like blebs on their surface ; have the chromatin ( DNA and protein ) in their nucleus degraded ; have their mitochondria break down with the release of cytochrome c ; break into small , membrane-wrapped , fragments . The phospholipid phosphatidylserine , which is normally hidden within the plasma membrane , is exposed on the surface . This is bound by receptors on phagocytic cells like macrophages and dendritic cells which then engulf the cell fragments . The phagocytic cells secrete cytokines that inhibit inflammation ( e.g. , IL-10 and TGF-β ) The pattern of events in death by suicide is so orderly that the process is often called programmed cell death or PCD . The cellular machinery of programmed cell death turns out to be as intrinsic to the cell as , say , mitosis . Programmed cell death is also called apoptosis.1 . Programmed cell death is as needed for proper development as mitosis is . Examples : The resorption of the tadpole tail at the time of its metamorphosis into a frog occurs by apoptosis . > > > > > > > > The formation of the fingers and toes of the fetus requires the removal , by apoptosis , of the tissue between them . The sloughing off of the inner lining of the uterus ( the endometrium ) at the start of menstruation occurs by apoptosis . The formation of the proper connections ( synapses ) between neurons in the brain requires that surplus cells be eliminated by apoptosis",0

"How does wood , steal , and concrete float ? Buoyancy is simple . If the weight of the liquid moved by insertion of an object into the liquid is greater than the weight of the object , it will float . That is why the size of ships are measured in displacement . The `` Displacement '' refers to the weight of water that is `` moved out of the way '' .Think of it this way - take two identical spheres with the exact same outer material and thinkness . One is hallow , and one is filled with lead . Of course , we know that the one filled with lead will sink ? Why ? Because it weighs more than the water that is being moved out of the way . How do you make it neutrally bouyant ? Simply fill it with enough lead that equals the weight of the water displaced by the sphere.This is called Archimedes Law of Bouyancy .

"who are muslims ? A Muslim is a believer in or follower of Islam . The word Muslim means one who submits and implies complete submission to the will of God ( Allah ) . Muslims believe that nature is itself Islamic , since it follows natural laws placed by God . Thus , a Muslim strives to surrender to God 's commands every step of the way.Until recently the word was also spelled Moslem . Muslims do not recommend this spelling because it is often pronounced `` mawzlem , '' which sounds like an Arabic word for `` oppressor . '' Many English-language writers used to call Muslims `` Mohammedans '' or `` Mahometans '' , meaning `` followers of Mohammed '' , but this terminology is considered incorrect and insulting , because Muslims believe it implies that they worship the prophet Muhammad , contrary to the fundamental principles of Islam itself.Sources of IslamSunni sources of IslamThe Holy Quran Ahadith ( singular Hadith ) - recordings of the life of the Prophet Muhammad , reported by any one of his companions .

"I was in a wreck with a state highway department car and totalled my car . how long should it take to resolve ? I was in a car wreck with a state highway deparment person . It was his fault . my car was totalled . How long should it take to process my claim ? they said up to 6 months since personal injury was involved , but a friend said that it would n't take that long and after a certain period of time , they arent liable anymore . so my question is basically how long should it take ? It really depends . Public entities do not work very fast . If you need to resolve your claim , not so much fast , but faster , you should file a claim with your own insurance company . Once you settle your claim with your own insurance company , your insurance company will subrogate the claim and go after the `` highway department '' for the money they paid you . So long as you are paid what you are owed by your insurance company , the highway department may drag their feet as long as they like . Hope that helps .",0

"Why does n't the Jewish religion believe in Jesus if he was a Jew ? Maybe this is all ignorance on my part . I do n't know . I really want to know . Truly and honestly , I 'm just trying to educate myself further . Any explanations are greatly appreciated . PLEASE look at the following : :http : //WhatJewsBelieve.orghttp : //Convert.org The basic beliefs of Christianity about Jesus are against what the Bible says , and so Real Jews can not believe in Jesus at all.The Christian understanding is that the Messiah , Jesus , died for the sins of the people . The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin.But we are taught in our Torah that no one can die for the sins of another . In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death forthe fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin ( eesh b ’ chet-o yumatu ) .In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself to atone for the sins of the people . To be written out of Gd 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . Gd 's response is No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : Exodus 32:30-35 And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Etrnl ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Etrnl , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Etrnl said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book . The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for Gd 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd will forgive us.So , the Bible is clear , no one can die for the sins of another , and this means that Jesus can not die for anyone else 's sins.Christians also believe that one needs a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin , that one who does not have such a blood sacrifice will die in their sins , and go to hell , except for the sacrifice of Jesus.This , too , is UnBiblical . The Bible describes blood sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin in the Book of Leviticus . But it is in Leviticus itself , in the middle of the discussion of the sin sacrifices , that we are taught that we do not need a blood sacrifice to be forgiven for our sins . Offering a blood sacrifice was an expensive thing to do for the family offering the animal . Was forgiveness then , to be only for the rich ? No , because if one could not afford a blood sacrifice then one who sins could bring flour , which has no blood and no life as their sacrifice , and Gd forgave them ! Leviticus 5:11-13 ; But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering ; he shall put no oil upon it , neither shall he put any frankincense thereon : for it is a sin offering.Furthermore , read the Book of Jonah . In Jonah , the People of Ninevah do three things in order to be forgiven by Gd . They fast , they pray for forgiveness , and they stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgave them ! This is exactly what we do on Yom Kippur , we fast , we pray for forgiveness , and , hopefully , we stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgives us . And what book do we read on Yom Kippur afternoon ? The Book of Jonah ! Jonah 3:7-10 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Ninevah , by the decree of the King and his nobles , saying , Let neither man nor beast , herd nor flock taste anything ; let them not feed nor drink water ; but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto Gd ; yea , let them turn every one from his evil",0

"which are better ... sit ups or crunches ? Traditional sit-ups emphasize sitting up rather than merely pulling your sternum down to meet your pelvis .

Because of this , when you are doing sit ups your psoas muscles are the primary muscles being engaged and not your abdominal exercises .

How does the Japanese manage to keep their race so pure ? About 99.4 % of Japan 's population is pureblood Japanese . Korea is around 99 % pureblood Korean also . China I think 92 % fullblood Chinese . Why do foreigners want to move to Europe ? Europe now has a modest share of Africans and Muslims . Is it because Asia better tries to preserve their race or do the Europeans not care about being a homogeneous society like Asian countries ?

"why the police is not cancelling the driver 's lic of D U I ? Wow ! The police do not actually cancel the driver 's license . Not local police.The State Highway Patrol actually terminate your license . A court will normally decide on the suspension of a license for other than a non-payment of a annual license fee . The officer of the law simply writes the Citation , the `` Ticket '' . The State Police or Highway Patrol is the Agency responsible for the issue and control statewide for the license , and will simply carry out the orders of the Court . The `` Court '' is simply a Judge . Local Police do not ordinarily carry out these duties , but if a Judge so orders they will so act . Really nothing is unusual about it.So the Police Officer can give you a break only at the time when he is writing the Citation , or just prior to actual Court . Once a decision by a Judge has been rendered , it is out of the Officer 's hands . HE CAN NOT CANCEL ANYTHING ! APS",0
"My BF lost his drivers liscence for 3 months ?

Support your answer by drawing from a Sociological Perspective . I am not a sociologist but I will answer as an American who follows world events rather closely . If we do not do something to help defend this country then we will no longer cease to exist as a country . There are so many people that want America destroyed that it takes a lot of soldiers , marines , CIA , etc to avert total disaster in this country . The bottom line is that some Americans realize that our country and way of life has survived so long by the blood of our American soldiers . Others simply take that fact for granted .",0

"What should I expect if I become a single parent. ? Explain the hardships and the joys of single parenting . What should I expect out of my future former spouse ? He is of the bullying , mentally abusive breed to both the kids and I . It really depends on whether you have a helpful , concerned family around and some close friendships . It 's also a consideration if you have work skills or not . Your standard of living usually goes down with a divorce so you may need to take some classes and find a career that will interest and support you and your children.It can be an exhilerating thing to walk out of an abusive marriage and go out on your own without fear . Making preparations before leaving will be a good thing in the long run . Perhaps , you would want to ask him to visit a marriage counselor with you a few times before deciding absolutely . Of course it 's best for children to grow up with their own parents - but if he wo n't try to change and continues to be abusive , you must go.For the unprepared and those without family ties , it can be extremely hard . It 's difficult to make ends meet on low wages .

"What does sexual side effect mean ? Personal Side Effectsof StatinsImpotence , Loss of Libido and Erectile Dysfunction The pharmaceutical industry would lead us to believe that rapidly bottoming out our natural cholesterol levels through the use of their highly touted statin drugs is a relatively innocuous process of definite benefit to society . But as we learn more each day of this ubiquitous and unique cholesterol substance , we must question the veracity of their medical advisors . Cholesterol is perhaps the most important substance in our lives for we could not live without an abundant supply of it in our bodies . Researchers everywhere are learning how extraordinarily complex and often surprising are the pathways that produce and metabolize cholesterol . Cholesterol is the precursor for a whole class of hormones known as the steroid hormones that are absolutely critical for life , as we know it . These hormones determine our sexuality , control the reproductive process , and regulate blood sugar levels and mineral metabolism . This same substance that society has been taught to fear happens to be our sole source for our hormones , androgen , estrogen and progesterone .",0

"What if you are wrong ? Like the song says , What if you are wrong and Christ is the son of God who has died for you and is the only way to the Father . Are you be willing to take that risk without at least searching for the truth ? Is your eternity worth looking into ? But I am not wrong , unless you think the Bible is wrong ! And if the Bible is not wrong , then you should examine your beliefs , and you will come to the conclusion you should convert to Judaism.The place i look to see what i should believe , and to check against to see if other beliefs are wrong is the Bible , the Hebrew Scriptures , and when i check i check in the original Hebrew.Here is what it says , in contrast to Christianity : : : The Christian understanding is that the Messiah , Jesus , died for the sins of the people . The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin.But we are taught in our Torah that no one can die for the sins of another . In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death forthe fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin ( eesh b'chet-o yumatu ) .In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself to atone for the sins of the people . To be written out of Gd 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . Gd 's response is No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : Exodus 32:30-35 And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Etrnl ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Etrnl , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Etrnl said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book . The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for Gd 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd will forgive us.So , the Bible is clear , no one can die for the sins of another , and this means that Jesus can not die for anyone else 's sins.Christians also believe that one needs a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin , that one who does not have such a blood sacrifice will die in their sins , and go to hell , except for the sacrifice of Jesus.This , too , is UnBiblical . The Bible describes blood sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin in the Book of Leviticus . But it is in Leviticus itself , in the middle of the discussion of the sin sacrifices , that we are taught that we do not need a blood sacrifice to be forgiven for our sins . Offering a blood sacrifice was an expensive thing to do for the family offering the animal . Was forgiveness then , to be only for the rich ? No , because if one could not afford a blood sacrifice then one who sins could bring flour , which has no blood and no life as their sacrifice , and Gd forgave them ! Leviticus 5:11-13 ; But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering ; he shall put no oil upon it , neither shall he put any frankincense thereon : for it is a sin offering.Furthermore , read the Book of Jonah . In Jonah , the People of Ninevah do three things in order to be forgiven by Gd . They fast , they pray for forgiveness , and they stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgave them ! This is exactly what we do on Yom Kippur , we fast , we pray for forgiveness , and , hopefully , we stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgives us . And what book do we read on Yom Kippur afternoon ? The Book of Jonah ! Jonah 3:7-10 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Ninevah , by the decree of the King and his noble",0

"Hi there , Does anyone have advice for people considering starting a relationship with somebody with Herpes ? I am having a difficult time getting comfortable with the fact that my girlfriend has HSV I and II ( and I do not ) . I am afraid , knowing that if I choose to stay in this relationship , I will eventually end up getting it as well ... and there is no way to know how my body will react to the virus ' . Right now I am viewing the virus as a magnifying glass that makes small concerns seem like larger ones , because it is a huge commitment just to try to see if the relationship will be successful . The relationship would already have more than normal amounts of stressors because of geographical issues ( I 'd have to move a long distance to be with her ) and other reasons . We have been doing the long-distance dating which is great , but distance makes the heart grow fonder as well . I feel like a very bad person for having these feelings , but I 'm trying to get a grasp on things , so please help if you have any insights . being educated on these things is best.. and knowing the risks . If she was dis-abled would you feel differantly ? feelings that are from the true heart can over come any ostacle ... never feel bad about weighing out things that can effect the rest of your life.. always good to reach out to get knowledge..",0
"Why do my feet smell so bad ? The main reason some people 's feet ( or more precisely , some people 's socks and shoes ) smell worse than other people 's is that some people sweat more than other people . This is just one of the many variable physiological qualities of human beings . This is also why sometimes your feet smell much worse than at other times -- it all has to do with how much you sweat.So , since foot odor is caused by bacteria digesting sweat , there are two main ways to reduce the stink . You can : * decrease the amount of bacteria on your feet * decrease the amount of sweat that collects on your feet and in your shoes Reducing the level of bacteria is really a matter of cleanliness . To control the bacteria population on you feet , you should : * wash your feet with strong anti-bacterial soap * wear clean socks * do n't wear the same shoes everyday - give a pair of shoes 24 hours or more to air out before wearing them again To reduce the amount of sweat that collects in your shoes , you should : * wear well-ventilated shoes instead of very constrictive shoes , such as boots * always wear socks , preferably made of cotton or other absorbent materials that absorb a lot of the sweat so the bacteria ca n't feed on it * change your socks a few times a day * buy some absorbent Odor-Eater type shoe inserts * apply an antiperspirant to your feet If your foot odor is really bad and these solutions do n't help much , then you should see a doctor . There are a number of prescription drugs that can treat serious foot odor , some by killing bacteria and some by reducing foot sweat .",0

"When God created the world , He made one . Why then are our skins different & We marry when we should be sibbling There was a time when people were hunter-gatherers and lived a nomadic lifestyle . Because of this , the population spread throughout the world . Over time , peoples ' skin colors changed to adapt to the amount and intensity of the sun where they lived . For example , people closer to the equator developed darker skin because they got a lot of sunlight and people closer to the poles developed lighter skin because they got a lot less sunlight . That 's why people have different skin colors . Why do people marry when we are really all distant relatives ? Well , if the Biblical accounts are to be accepted , the simple truth is that we do marry our far-distant relatives . In fact , in the South , when a person marries , one of the questions on the marriage application is , `` are you related by blood ? '' . It is not uncommon in that area of the country , and is allowed by law , for second cousins to marry .",0
"Why do I continue to cheat on my girlfriend of 13 years ? I know that this will cause an unhealth relationship between us but I also feel like she is truely the only women I see myself spending the rest of my life with . Just alittle bit of extra information she has cheat on me in the past on different occasions so this is not just one sided . We still stay together after we find out . I do n't know exactly what drives me to do it if it 's the attention that I get from the new relationship or if there is just something wrong with me mentally or if I 'm trying to live out a swingers life style without my girlfriend being involved . The other ladies that I have been with all know that I have been with her for as long as I have and it does n't seem to stop them from going through with the act . They even know that I will not ever leave her and it is more of just a sexual thing . I know most people that see this are going to think I 'm scum and maybe I am but I 'm here asking a question that I do n't know the exact answer to and would like help . It seems clear that you love your girlfriend but long for a larger life . Maybe it would be best to break up with her , but still remain good friends who occassionally turn to each other for sex . That way , after a time , she can actually give guidance and conversation about your choices of sleeping partner - then there are no secrets and less guilt .",0

"Is there a dallas bias ? Do the Dallas Cowboys have a bias against them with the media in the rest of the country ? I do n't think that a bias necessarily exists within the media , but among fans I believe there sure are a lot of Cowboys haters . There are several reasons for this . For one , there is a little bit of jealousy for `` America 's Team '' . These feelings are still carrying over from their dynasty in the 90 's ( and even the 70s ) . Also , the organization has had many abrasive characters : owner Jerry Jones , the Tuna , ex-stars such as Michael Irvin , and the myriad of criminals and druggies they 've paraded through in the last 10/15 years . As with any great sports organization , fans are very polarized ... you either love 'em or hate 'em . I love 'em , but conversely I despise great competing teams such as the Steelers and 49ers . Some in the media may have their beef with Jerry Jones or other people in the organization , but I think the strong anti-Dallas emotion is mainly among the fans ( which is a tribute to the Cowboys being one of the top teams in the sport ) .",0

"how to treat plantar faciitis ? There are several things you can try.Anti-inflammatory medications like Ibuprofen or Naproxen may be helpful , taken with food.Fill an empty soda bottle with water and freeze . With a sock on , roll your heel over the ice bottle for 10-15 minutes , 3-4 times a day.NEVER go barefoot ! NOt even to the bathroom in the middle of the night . Always have good supportive shoes on.Stretching your calf muscle may help , particularly if you have a tight achilles to begin with . Face a wall , and place your plans on it . With the affected leg further behind you , lean into the wall , keeping your back leg straight and the heel on the floor . Then stretch with your knee slightly bent.If these methods do n't work , see your health care provider . A stronger anti-inflammatory medicine may be prescribed , he or she may evaluate you for orthotics , or supports that go into your shoes . Physical therapy may be helpful , and some people even have a cortisone injection into the heel .",0

"How does the cold make you cough ? What 's the connection between bad weather and microbes inside us ? It 's simple . Our bodies system , especially the defense system , work best on a range of temperature . When the temperature outside ( that will affect the inside body temperature ) is changed , it changed the whole things that happened in our body , such as hormones , blood pressure , and especially , the lifosit ( the body 's defense `` army '' ) . Sure , if the lifosit ca n't work well , so does the entire body 's defense system . But why microbes still can live at its best ? Simple , because the microbes ' temperature tolerance is higher ( or `` cooler '' ) than our body.So in short , when our body is in cold , it 's just like a snow hurricane winter to our body 's defense system , but still a summer springtime for the microbes . When the microbes spread over the body , it then attacks the part of the body that it loves , such as the brain ( so that it makes you dizzy ) , the defense system ( and the body reacted with rising your body temperature to reactivate the lifosit ) , and the sponge organ within our neck ( that 's their fave place ) . That 's the reason why if you get cold , wearing a syal or drinking hot tea makes better .",0

"pls send me the english lyrics of the poem `` mi ultimo adios '' by Philippine hero Jose Rizal.. pls ... ? ? ? The Last Farewell ( English version of Mi Ultimo Adios ) by Jose RizalFarewell , my adored Land , region of the sun caressed , Pearl of the Orient Sea , our Eden lost , With gladness I give you my Life , sad and repressed ; And were it more brilliant , more fresh and at its best , I would still give it to you for your welfare at most.On the fields of battle , in the fury of fight , Others give you their lives without pain or hesitancy , The place does not matter : cypress laurel , lily white , Scaffold , open field , conflict or martyrdom 's site , It is the same if asked by home and Country.I die as I see tints on the sky b'gin to showAnd at last announce the day , after a gloomy night ; If you need a hue to dye your matutinal glow , Pour my blood and at the right moment spread it so , And gild it with a reflection of your nascent light ! My dreams , when scarcely a lad adolescent , My dreams when already a youth , full of vigor to attain , Were to see you , gem of the sea of the Orient , Your dark eyes dry , smooth brow held to a high planeWithout frown , without wrinkles and of shame without stain.My life 's fancy , my ardent , passionate desire , Hail ! Cries out the soul to you , that will soon part from thee ; Hail ! How sweet 't is to fall that fullness you may acquire ; To die to give you life , 'neath your skies to expire , And in your mystic land to sleep through eternity ! If over my tomb some day , you would see blow , A simple humble flow'r amidst thick grasses , Bring it up to your lips and kiss my soul so , And under the cold tomb , I may feel on my brow , Warmth of your breath , a whiff of your tenderness.Let the moon with soft , gentle light me descry , Let the dawn send forth its fleeting , brilliant light , In murmurs grave allow the wind to sigh , And should a bird descend on my cross and alight , Let the bird intone a song of peace o'er my site.Let the burning sun the raindrops vaporizeAnd with my clamor behind return pure to the sky ; Let a friend shed tears over my early demise ; And on quiet afternoons when one prays for me on high , Pray too , oh , my Motherland , that in God may rest I.Pray thee for all the hapless who have died , For all those who unequalled torments have undergone ; For our poor mothers who in bitterness have cried ; For orphans , widows and captives to tortures were shied , And pray too that you may see your own redemption.And when the dark night wraps the cemet'ryAnd only the dead to vigil there are left alone , Do n't disturb their repose , do n't disturb the mystery : If you hear the sounds of cittern or psaltery , It is I , dear Country , who , a song t'you intone.And when my grave by all is no more remembered , With neither cross nor stone to mark its place , Let it be plowed by man , with spade let it be scatteredAnd my ashes ere to nothingness are restored , Let them turn to dust to cover your earthly space.Then it does n't matter that you should forget me : Your atmosphere , your skies , your vales I 'll sweep ; Vibrant and clear note to your ears I shall be : Aroma , light , hues , murmur , song , moanings deep , Constantly repeating the essence of the faith I keep.My idolized Country , for whom I most gravely pine , Dear Philippines , to my last goodbye , oh , harkenThere I leave all : my parents , loves of mine , I 'll go where there are no slaves , tyrants or hangmenWhere faith does not kill and where God alone does reign.Farewell , parents , brothers , beloved by me , Friends of my childhood , in the home distressed ; Give thanks that now I rest from the wearisome day ; Farewell , sweet stranger , my friend , who brightened my way ; Farewell , to all I love . To die is to rest .",0
"How often or how much can I drink Coke without it rotting my teeth ? I think it depends on how you drink it and what you do in between . Using a straw should do less damage . Sipping throughout the day should be the worst as you keep the teeth covered constantly . So to improve your intake without doing too much damage to your teeth ( I am not talking about other areas of the body ) I would think you should drink more fewer times a day and use a straw . In between chew gum or eat some other stuff that neutralizes the sugar and acid . I would also talk to a dentist first , as she can better judge how vulnerable your teeth are .",0

"How do you explain this ... . ? 50 % of all auto accidents are alcohol related , but only 40 % of those accidents are actually caused be the driver that was drinking . MADD claims that drunks could have prevented some of those accidents if their reaction time which was impaired by alcohol were eliminated . However if 60 % of all accidents that involve alcohol are caused by the sober person , if everyone quit drinking and driving if you go by the stats supplied by MADD , the amount of accidents would actually rise around 30 % . From a purely mathematical perspective , you 're right . But of course this would eliminate using the proper logic that the lack of alcohol intake makes for fewer impaired drivers that would be unable to effectively avoid an accident.Either way , do n't drink and drive ... you might spill your drink .",0

"Would frozen blood bullets really kill someone ? My first thought is it sounds great but it probably wouldnt work . However I am not scientific at all so I though maybe someone could offer me better insight.And maybe a reason why or why not ? In English or German , the answer would be the same . Although the bullet may not cause enough physical damage , there are other things to consider , including site of entry.Mythbusters never shot a live animal ( too much fuss for a publicly viewed TV show ) . If they had , they might have answered the question better . If shot into major artery , the vicitm would probably die of blood loss . I am not sure of what would happen if shot into the ear or the roof of the mouth . If the victim lived , it might never be the same.Unlike the water bullet , if the blood was the vicitm 's , I do not think this could be discovered . I loved the question .",0

"How should the nuclear standoff with Iran be resolved ? I do n't understand . US suggests they want to attack Israel . But Iran has already tons of WMD 's and an outstanding army ( nothing to do with the Taliban Afghanistan , or the isolated Sadam ) , besides the great power of being the fourth reserve of oil , and the economic power it represents . Iran says they want nuclear power , to be a developed country . But it 's not necessary to have nuclear power to develop . Many European countries or the neighbour Arab Emirats , are more than developed wihtout nuclear power . A military strike would be the worse option . If they want to have nuclear power or even nukes , they should , like many other countries , even with dictators do . Only because they do n't have a good relationship with Israel or US , it should n't be banned . If in 10 years they dare to attack someone with nukes , they will be easily smashed back .

"Can anyone help me with algabra ? i do n't understand the geomitry part of a algabra it confuses me I do n't understand how to simplify square routes . When you square a number you are multiplying it by itself . For example 3ft x 3ft = 9 square feet or 3 squared = 9 . But if you had a real square ( a box top with equal sides like a huge pizza box ) and each side was 3 feet , the area of the box would be 3ft x 3ft = 9 sq-ft. You can think of squaring a number as the geometric operation of taking the sides of a square and multiplying them to get the square area as shown.Taking a square root is just the opposite . You start with the square area of the box top and find the sides . If the box top is 9 square feet you want to know the value of any two sides ( the other two sides will be the same ) . a square area of 9 sq-ft = 3ft x 3ft . There are methods for calculating square feet or it can be done using a hand calculator , but it helps to know what is really going on.When you square a number or find the square root of a number you can also use pure numbers ( 3 or 9 rather than 3ft or 9 sq-ft ) and there does n't need to be any real pizza box involved even though you use the word `` square .

Song of Solomon chapter 4 and 5 is about oral sex and its told through a metaphor , if you do n't think so read it for yourself.There 's another place that says between a man and his wife the bed is undefiled , which means anything goes as long as they are both comfortable with it . The Bible only states that you should be married . If there is no specific stop signs in scripture , here is what you do . Pray first , then make love . If you feel comfortable and closer to your mate , go for it . There is a great book titled `` Sheet Music '' that really helps find maximum enjoyment in the marriage bed . I highly recommend it.http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/0842360247",0
"How do I make my girlfriend feel better ? My girlfriend 's been working on college applications and she still is , which is cool , but I think she 's overworking herself.The last couple times I 've seen her , she looked exausted and worn out . I believe that the stress is getting to her.Now , she does n't want to spend time with me , saying that she will after she 's done with her applications ( they being due on Jan 2 , 2006 at the latest ) . This is completely understandable , because she needs to get the work done.I sent her flowers on Christmas Eve to cheer her up and make her feel better , which they did , but only temporarily.I ca n't stand seeing her like this . She looks like she 's going to have a breakdown soon.This actually started when she applied early decision to Standford and got rejected . She says that this rejection has caused her to lose confidence and now she thinks that she ca n't get into any college.I do n't know what to do . = ( Help . Please ... ( ** ) < |Dead FishOllec , the Fish Slayer She 'll be ok . The stress she feels is temporary . If she is like me , she just needs time alone to focus and not feel like she needs to pay attention to other 's needs right now . I bet she is a very giving person . She is being too hard on herself , though . Stress will make you say and do silly things . Maybe if you sent her a love letter telling her how much you love her and admire her strength and abilities . Let her know you are behind her 100 % and ca n't wait to see her get into a college . Tell her you are proud of her for working so hard . Just basically do all you can to boost her up and make her feel special . Send the letter ( hand written ! ) through regular mail . For some reason , and hand written love letter is always the best thing in the world to cheer up a gal ! Good luck .",0

"Do You Belive th Entire Bible ? Do you belive in the entire bible , including Genisis ( not evolution ) , the New Testemant , and everything that God ( and Jesus ) says or commands ? Yes . But not the contorted , twisted , taken out of context versions that were edited to fit someones personal desires . Somethings in the bible dont quite sound right , but when you understand it and read the whole story of whats going on it all makes sense . Its like zooming out from just a few threads to see the big beautiful quilt . Its all interlinked and beautifully orchestrated . Its hard to see the whole thing when you focus just on a couple threads here and there.Faith is essential for belief.I find it neccessary to rebuke this blisschameleon , '' Evolution proves adam and eve wrong . '' Evolution is not proven . Also why are we not still evolving . The bible says God made each one according to its kind . `` And our knowledge of other solar stystems proves that there is n't just one sun in the entire universe . '' God has one Son , Jesus Christ . He made light and darkness . Please direct me to the scripture where you claim it says `` God made one sun , and one solar system . `` `` Humans traveling to space proves the tower of Babalon wrong . '' The destruction of Babylon was not over how far from the Earth the Babylonians were making themselves . It was about their attitude . Their wanting to build the tower to make themselves equal to God . Certainly this would not make it so , but it had nothing to do with a tower . `` Jesus ' story having similarities to osirus and Hercules.God condoning slavery , racism , sexism , violence ... revenge in some scriptures and disaproving them in other scriptures . '' God is the author of all things . My dear chameleon , you have failed to grasp the concept . God does not condone these things . He allows us to make decisions which results in our sin . You have failed to understand what is going on in the Bible . You are so far from the truth . Sexism ? ? ? ? ! ! ! Come on , did you even read the Bible ? Women are to be submissive to their husbands , yes . But there is even greater responsibility from the husbands to the wives .

"um..i got ta queston ? does anyone know of any kind of product , thats not that expensive for acne . Because i 've tried several different things , but they do n't want to seem to work . Okay 1. what causes acne ? 2.what should I use to clear it ? hormonesFor most people with acne , it begins at puberty . This is when the body starts to produce hormones called androgens . Androgens cause the enlargement and overstimulation of the sebaceous glands in people with acne . Sensitivity to these androgens also cause acne to appear during the menstrual cycle and sometimes in pregnancy . The extra sebum ( oil ) that the sebaceous glands produce mixes with dead skin cells and bacteria on the skin 's surface and this blocks pores . Inside the blocked pore , bacteria multiply and cause inflammation leading to the spots and pustules associated with acne.stressStress can also cause the production of hormones , such as cortisol , which can aggravate acne.other causes * Acne is often genetic * Some medications and steroids * Heavy or oily make up * Over abrasive cleansing o Astringent facial products can dry the skin out causing the body to create even more sebum to compensate o Use of harsh exfoliators can damage existing spots and spread infection o Picking or squeezing of blackheads , whiteheads and spots can send the infection deeper into the skin and cause scarring * A diet high in foods that can aggravate acneou really can get rid of acne , naturally . How ? By learning about the causes of acne and how to rebalance the body . By understanding that applying harsh chemicals to the skin can actually exacerbate the skin 's natural oil production and make acne worse . Why is it that people who do n't eat a Western diet do n't have acne ? You , too , can get rid of acne by understanding why it 's predominantly a Western problem . In parts of the world where a Western diet is being adopted , they are now getting acne.Our bodies are fine-tuned machines , continually creating new cells and getting rid of dead cells . There are three processes vital to human health ; appropriation ( taking in food , air , water etc ) , assimilation ( absorbing nutrients to create new cells ) and elimination ( expelling waste/toxins ) . If any one of these is unbalanced , this can lead to less than vital health . We need to take in the right fuel , use it effectively and get rid of by-products and waste . For example , we get rid of waste via the digestive system , the lungs and the skin ; if the digestive system is sluggish waste may have to be expelled via the skin as blocked pores and acne .",0

"what are nephillims ( ? ) are they the offspring of the fallen angels ? The Nephilim ( fallen ones , giants ) were the offspring of sexual relationships between the sons of God and daughters of men in Genesis 6:1-4 . There is much debate as to the identity of the `` sons of God '' ( see our article on this subject here ) . I believe the correct view is that they were fallen angels ( demons ) who mated with human females and/or possessed human males and then mated with human females . These unions resulted in offspring that were `` heroes of old , men of renown '' ( Genesis 6:4 ) . What were the Nephilim ? According to Hebrew and other legends ( the Book of Enoch and other non-Biblical writings ) , they were a race of giants and super-heroes who did acts of great evil . Their great size and power likely came from the mixture of demonic `` DNA '' with human genetics . All that the Bible directly says about them is that they were `` heroes of old , men of renown '' ( Genesis 6:4 ) . The Nephilim were not aliens , they were literal , physical beings produced from the union of the sons of God and daughters of men ( Genesis 6:1-4 ) .",0

"How people judge people ? do you judge people by looks , personality , way-of thinking ... Initially , people judge people by appearance and actions , because these are the first things that you can observe about someone . You can judge this up close or from a distance . People usually judge based on comparing another person to their own appearance , and how much the appearance differs from their own appearance.If someone takes the time to get to know someone , they will judge a person on `` deeper '' issues : intelligence , ways of spending time , ways of treating others , and beliefs . Of course , these again are perceived by the person that is doing the judging , and they 're usually compared to their own characteristics/beliefs.Should people judge people ? Yes , and no . It 's good to have standards that you expect of people , in terms of how you are treated , and standards of common decency . However , one should keep in mind that this world would be a boring place if we were all the same , and that everyone does not have the same experiences that you have . So , although judging is hard to avoid , you have to control what you do with your judgements . And it 's always good to reassess what you think of someone . Try to get to know people better .",0

First , we dont call out Bible the 'Old Testament ' because we dont believe there is a new one.However , yes , the Orthodox Jewish community still follows the laws you describe above.By the way , this means that for roughly 2 weeks each month , a Jewish couple who follow this law will not have sex as an issue between them . It means that for half of each month , they must relate to each other as platonic friends , and this makes the relationship far stronger , and is one reason given for the very low divorce rate throughout the history of the Jewish People . Only since the Jews have assimilated , become like their non-Jewish neighbors , has the divorce rate risen to the same rate as among their non-Jewish counterparts , but continues to remain low among the orthodox .",0

"I wake up with shooting pain in my right heel , daily , how do I fix it ? I had this for a long time in my left heel and did not know what this `` knife '' in my foot was ... until I found out that I had a ruptured disc ( L4/L5 area ) and the ruptured disc was pushing against the sciatic nerve that was going through the left leg ... in your case the ruptured disc is pushing out on the right side and affects your right leg . You COULD stay in bed - flat - for 3 days and see if it gets better ... the `` red hot inflamed '' nerve may calm down a bit and you might feel better ... you could take Aleve to calm the inflamation of the nerve ... you could get a shot of Cordisone in the spine ... anywhichway ... you need to see a neurologist who will take an MRI and tell you if you need surgery . In my case I am overweight and they did not want to touch me `` with a ten foor pole '' . I healed mine by going the other way ... I found a machine called VAX-D at a chiropractors and ( look on google ) was able to go 30 times and then I was completely out of pain and able to walk again . Other things you will feel with this is numbness in your right thigh ... occasionally a nerve-line pain all the way down your right leg and also a `` spray '' of pain over the top of your right foot . You SHOULD have also a `` pilot-lite '' burning feeling in your lower back on the right side of the spine where the actual disc is pushing . This is the line of the nerves ... from the lower back through the right side of the leg into the foot . Go look at a picture of the nerves that go through the body . Bonati Institute in Florida will also do Laser surgery for this ... but in my case it did not work.Good luck ! The Oracle",0

"over 200 years ago what did Carolus Linnaeus classify living things on ? Taxonomy . In his major work Systema Naturae ( The System of Nature ) , first published in 1735 , Linnaeus devised a system of classification of organisms that is still in use today . This system places living things within increasingly specific categories based on common attributes—from a general grouping ( kingdom ) down to the specific individual ( species ) . Using this system , Linnaeus named nearly 10,000 plant and animal species in his lifetime . Not an evolutionist by any means , Linnaeus believed that each species was created by God and was incapable of change . Nevertheless , his orderly groupings of living things provided important insights for later theorists .",0

"What is an alpha male ? An alpha male or alpha female is the individual in the community whom the others follow and defer to . Humans and their nearest species-relatives , the chimpanzees , show deference to the alpha of the community by ritualized gestures such as bowing , allowing the alpha to walk first in a procession , or standing aside when the alpha challenges . Canines also show deference to the alpha pair in their pack , by allowing them to be the first to eat and , usually , the only pair to mate . Wolves are a well known example of this.The status of alpha is generally achieved by means of superior physical prowess . However in certain highly-social species such as the Bonobo apes , the alpha can use more indirect methods ( such as political alliances ) to oust the ruling alpha and take his/her place .",0
"what should I do ? I feel like all of my prayers are'nt getting through to God , I 've backslide alot lately and I 'm scared that God dosent accept me any more . It seems like every thing I do is wrong , and conviction jumps on me and makes me feel so down . I feel like I 'm a million miles away from God . And all day long I 'm constanty thinking what I can do to please God . Can any one figure out what is wrong with me and my walk with Christ ? I just long for more of God to be in my life , and i can not stop thinking about Him , He 's on my mind all day long . We are called to rejoice and be glad ( Matt 5:11-12 ) . But we are also warned to be sober-minded ( Rom 12:3 ) . One of the most fearful verses I know that keeps me most sober is Matthew 7:21-23 : 21 “ Not everyone who says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter the kingdom of heaven , but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven . 22Many will say to me on that day , ‘ Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy in your name , and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles ? ’ 23Then I will tell them plainly , ‘ I never knew you . Away from me , you evildoers ! ’ You can not DO anything to please God . He is pleased with perfection . Jesus is perfection , and died for your sins in your place . Do good because he loves you , not to pay your way back `` in '' . Grace is a gift not deserved . See Romans 7 : 14-20.Love the Lord your God with Everything-Trust in Him . The life of the Christian is not easy , it may in fact be hard , for some it has cost their lives , but the rewards for trust and obediance will be phenominal .",0

"Why is the Interior of an airplaine pressurized and what would happen if there was a hole in the exterior wall Explain why the interior of an airplane is pressurized when flying at high altitude . If a hole were punctured in an exterior wall , what would happen to the air pressure inside the plane ? An Airplane is pressurised to provide the same pressure as at sea level , or ground altitude for passanger confort and to provent altutiude sickness . You can not breath the air at 20,000 feet with the same amount of oxygen per beath as at sea level . You would pass out from a lack of oxygen . If you get a hole in the airplane outer wall bernoullis principle says that there would be a fall in presure vacume on the other side of the hole causeing a depressurization of the interior of the aircraft to the pressure of 20,000 feet . With a Depressure of cabin air you would see a fog of water droplets in the air , as the density of water in the air becomes more from the oxygen being sucked out of the cabin . As you have seen in movies the hole will be riped larger if it is big enough to alow a large amount of air though and the structure is weak enough in that area . In alot of aircrafts the outer wall is a part of the pressure system of the aircraft keeping a seperation between internal pressure and external pressure . The whole aircraft is not pressureized wings and rear areas . so a hole in those area would n't cause a problum for the passangers .",0

"how to treat diarrhea in a toddler. ? While rarely serious when treated properly , diarrhea can send your toddler to the hospital if he becomes dehydrated , so your first concern should be giving him enough liquids . If your toddler is n't also vomiting , it should be fairly easy to give him extra water to drink . If he ca n't keep liquids down , though , or if his diarrhea is severe ( a watery bowel movement every two hours or more ) , call his doctor , who may suggest a pediatric electrolyte solution , like Pedialyte , ReVital , or a generic brand . These solutions are available in drugstores and come in flavors that most toddlers will readily drink if they 're dehydrated.Avoid sweetened fluids like sodas ( including ginger ale ) , athletic drinks ( like Gatorade ) , Jell-O , sugar water , and undiluted fruit juices . All of these contain sugar that will draw water into the intestine and make the diarrhea worse . Also do n't use anti-diarrhea medication unless the doctor prescribes it.Doctors now advise continuing to feed solid foods to a child with diarrhea . While there 's nothing wrong with feeding your toddler the classic BRAT diet ( bananas , rice , applesauce , and dry toast ) , the AAP says any foods made up of complex carbohydrates , such as rice , wheat , potatoes , bread , and cereal , as well as lean meats , yogurt , fruits , and vegetables , are safe to eat . ( If your toddler temporarily refuses to eat , do n't worry . As long as he stays hydrated his appetite should return in a day or two . ) Studies have shown that live bacterial cultures , found in yogurt , are a safe and effective way to cut down on the amount and duration of diarrhea . It 's an easy way to treat the problem , especially if your toddler loves the taste of yogurt . Just be sure to buy yogurt with lactobacillus , or live cultures.If your toddler is uncomfortable during a bout of diarrhea , try to cuddle and comfort him as much as possible and keep his bottom dry . Use care , tenderness , and plenty of diaper cream when changing him , since it 's easy for your toddler 's bottom to become red and irritated from the loose stools .",0

"why is the risk of semen-to-mouth transmission less than semen-to-vagina ? Risk of HIV transmission from semen to vagina is supposed to be because of vaginal mucus membrane absorbing the virus .

OK , ignoring the overly-emotional responses that some people have had to this question , it actually IS true that semen-to-mouth sex carries less of a risk of HIV transmission than semen-to-vagina . One caveat , though : The risk is NOT zero . Oral sex DOES carry a risk . Smaller , but a risk.Why ? No one has 100 % figured out . However , it is postulated that the digestive enzymes present in the saliva do a number on the HIV virus and are able to knock out a fair amount of the infectious little buggers . The vaginal secretions do n't contain these enzymes.So , no , our youth are NOT being lied to .",0

"What are the roots of the words in Esperanto ? The grammar itself is extremely easy , although it could have been easier . vocabulary from Romance and Germanic languages ; phonology from Slavic languages As a constructed language , Esperanto is not genealogically related to any ethnic language . Esperanto can be described as `` a language lexically predominantly romanic , morphologically intensively agglutinative and to a certain degree isolating in character '' The phonology , grammar , vocabulary , and semantics are based on the western Indo-European languages . The phonemic inventory is essentially Slavic , as is much of the semantics , while the vocabulary derives primarily from the Romance languages , with a lesser contribution from Germanic . Pragmatics and other aspects of the language not specified by Zamenhof 's original documents were influenced by the native languages of early speakers , primarily Russian , Polish , German , and French.Typologically , Esperanto has prepositions and a pragmatic word order that by default is Subject Verb Object and Adjective Noun . New words are formed through extensive prefixing and suffixing.Esperanto is written with a modified version of the Latin alphabet , including six letters with diacritics : ĉ , ĝ , ĥ , ĵ , ŝ and ŭ ( that is , c , g , h , j , s circumflex , and u breve ) . The alphabet does not include the letters q , w , x , y except in unassimilated foreign names .",0

"how can a helicopter hover while the earth is turning ? The first answer is correct . I think for the second answer , the questioner would probably be wondering ... well , if the helicopter takes off with the same velocity as the earth , since the heli is now hovering and the earth keeps on turning , why does n't the earth spin past the helicopter ... And that is simply because the atmosphere is turning around with the heli , like the first answer stated.Just wanted to elaborate with another example . A fly takes off from the dashboard of a speeding car with its windows closed . Does the fly stay in air or , since the fly is now seperated from the car , does the car rush forward , making it seem like the fly is hurtled to the back of the car ? Even in this case , the air inside the car is being brought along with the car at the same speed . Therefore , the speed of the fly relative to the car will always be 0 .",0

"Miami Dolphins perfect season ? In what year did the Miami Dolphins have thier perfectseason , and what team will likely be the next to do it .

In order to win them all , the best players must play every game , and no team is going to do that and jeopardize their chances of getting a star player injuried before the playoffs . That said , it IS entirely possible that it may happen again - I just would n't count on it . Too much has to happen in just the right way for a team to win 19 games in a row !",0

"define ergonomics elobrately ? Ergonomics ( or human factors ) is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system , and the profession that applies theory , principles , data and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance ( definition adopted by the International Ergonomics Association in 2000 ) .Ergonomists contribute to the design and evaluation of tasks , jobs , products , environments and systems in order to make them compatible with the needs , abilities and limitations of people ( IEA , 2000 ) .DomainsThe IEA divides ergonomics broadly into three domains : Physical ergonomics deals with the human body 's responses to physical and physiological loads . Relevant topics include manual materials handling , workstation layout , job demands , and risk factors such as repetition , vibration , force and awkward/static posture as they relate to musculoskeletal disorders ( see repetitive strain injury ) .Cognitive ergonomics , also known as engineering psychology , concerns mental processes such as perception , attention , cognition , motor control , and memory storage and retrieval as they affect interactions among humans and other elements of a system . Relevant topics include mental workload , vigilance , decision-making , skilled performance , human error , human-computer interaction , and training.Organizational ergonomics , or macroergonomics , is concerned with the optimization of sociotechnical systems , including their organizational structures , policies , and processes . Relevant topics include shift work , scheduling , job satisfaction , motivational theory , supervision , teamwork , telework and ethics.HistoryItalian Bernardino Ramazinni ( 1633-1714 ) became the first physician to write about work-related injuries and illnesses in his 1700 publication , `` De Morbis Artificum ( Diseases of Workers ) '' . Ramazinni was ostracized by his fellow doctors for visiting the workplaces of his patients in order to identify the causes of their disorders . The term ergonomics ( from the Greek words ergon [ work ] and nomoi [ natural laws ] ) first entered the modern lexicon when Wojciech Jastrzębowski used the word in his 1857 article Rys ergonomji czyli nauki o pracy , opartej na prawdach poczerpniętych z Nauki Przyrody ( adapted from a previous version of this page ) .Later in the 19th century , Frederick Taylor pioneered the `` Scientific Management '' method , an approach that sought the single best method to perform a job and its tasks . By incrementally reducing the size and weight of coal shovels until the optimum shoveling rate was reached , Taylor tripled the amount of coal that workers could shovel in a day . Frank and Lilian Gilbreth , in the early 1900s , expanded Taylor 's methods to develop `` Time and Motion Studies '' that aimed to improve efficiency by eliminating unnecessary steps and actions . By applying this approach , the Gilbreths reduced the number of motions in bricklaying from 18 to 4.5 , allowing bricklayers to increase their pace of laying bricks from 120 to 350 bricks per hour.World War II marked the advent of highly sophisticated machines and weaponry , creating previously unseen cognitive demands on operators in terms of decision-making , attention , situational awareness and hand-eye coordination . It was observed that perfectly working aircraft , flown by the best-trained pilots , still crashed . In 1943 , Alphonse Chapanis , a lieutenant in the U.S. Army , showed that `` pilot error '' could be greatly reduced when more logical and differentiable controls replaced confusing designs in airplane cockpits.In the decades following the war and leading to today , ergonomics has continued to flourish and diversify . The Space Age created new human factors issues such as weightlessness and extreme G-forces . To what extent could these environments be tolerated and what effects would they have on the mind and body ? The Information",0

"What would like to do to those individuals who ridicule and mock those that are in the military ? This question is for and ONLY for military personnel .

"Global warming ? Should we take steps to prevent global warming or should we just ride it out ? Several things : First , the data is flawed . Most temperature measurements are taken in cities where you have an increase of what is called a heat island that is growing . More asphalt and concret to store heat . Second the temp and CO2 levels are rising but so what . The CO2 levels have been 10 times higher than they currently are and the planet has been much hotter in the past and its done well enough for us to still be here . And all of that is without the help of humans.Third we are comming out of an ice age . Ice age=cold , no ice age=hot . Fourth the suns output of energy has risen in the past century , more energy into our system = more heat.Reasons why more CO2 is not a bad thing . Plants use CO2 for photosynthesis , more CO2 = more photosynthesis = more plants . The earth is in a greenification process right now that is turning alot of grasslands into areas that have shrubs and areas with shrubs are growing trees . Final thing , WE MUST CUT DOWN ON TOXIC POLLUTANTS . toxic waste , CFC 's and other horrible pollutants are destroying nature and that is 100 % our fault and quite preventable .",0

"What is the best way to develop my piano technique to play pop/rock songs ? I know chords , inversions , etc. , but how do I make what I do with my left hand more interesting ( I tend to just play octaves ) ? Are there any good books/courses that you could recommend ? Well I just started learning jazz piano in the fall to accompany my singing . I actually learned some good rhythm patterns for the standards so far , I know they arent pop or rock songs , but it might help.Some suggestions : In the left hand you can play the root tone ( C7 it would be C ) and then the 5th note ( G ) alternating . So like on the first beat C and then on the 3 beat G. To make it more interesting play the C on the 1 and the 2.5 ( leading to the G ) and then the G on the 3 and 4.5 . ( I usually do that on swing songs , so you play the offbeats right before the next beat so it has that swing feel ) You play the chord in the right hand on the 1 and 3 . ( or in swing songs sometimes on the 1.5 or you play the chord on the 4.5 of the measure before ) Also for the left hand you can think of a bass line , which is a little more complicated . Where you play bass notes on each note according to the chord and you lead it to the next chord . I believe that the notes on 1 and 3 should be in the chord . Im not very good at that yet , so I cant really say much more about bass lines.For bossa ( or a latin feel ) , you play the left hand like my first example but in a straight feel . Then you play the chord in the right hand on the 1 ( 1/8note ) 2 ( dotted 1/4 ) 3+ ( 1/4note ) Another suggestions is to listen carefully to music you like and hear what they are playing . Try putting up the bass and figure out what they are playing exactly in the bass . Then analyze the chords , try playing along . It takes some time and effort but will help develop your hearing and make you a better musician . It might help to get an experienced musician to give you lessons . I would suggest going to jam sessions and finding a piano player you like and ask he/she if they would give you lessons . I really learned a lot in a short time with the help of guided lessons . ( I know some other patterns as well , but they are difficult to explain in a forum , it helps to see and hear them in person . )",0

Since becoming vice president , Cheney has NOT divested himself of his Halliburton stock and has in fact continued to increase the company 's ( and his own ) profits . ( Note : An internal Pentagon email proves that a $ 7 billion no-bid contract awarded to Halliburton on March 8 , 2003 was `` coordinated '' with Cheney 's office . ) It is a safe bet that we are talking tens of billions ( with a B ) of dollars in Halliburton 's coffers since 9/11 , much of that money courtesy of Cheney and all of it courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer . This entire situation is criminal to the point of obscenity !",0
"Is a war with China inevitable ? Please , be specific . I do n't think the US is going to ask for war against China . That 's just stupid . But I think it is very likely that China will force us into War against our will . The teetering balance with Taiwan is just the tip of the iceberg . China has it 's eyes on the entire region -- the entire world for that matter.I think we 're safe for at least a few more years ... maybe even as many as 10 . China has n't finished feeding off of the US yet . They 'll wait until they have more money , more military technology , and they will wait until their generation of all men grows to a good military fighting age . There is a space of more than 10 years where the boys outnumber the girls 13 to 1 . This generation will be more enthused about risking their lives to take over territory that actually has females . It must be understood that this is n't `` inevitable '' just because China has the manpower . It is thought that it will happen because China pretty much says that it is going to happen . China , though it just loves to cater to the US 's cheep labor force needs , is openly anti-American . The students learn about the US as an evil empire . So is it truly `` inevitable '' ? I think the relationship between the US and China could change -- I think we could possibly become friends . But it is much more likely that in the future China will show aggression to the US or the US 's interest that will lead us into war .",0

"Nicolatians believe ... .. ? In the bible . The doctrine of the Nicolaitans was mentioned in the Apocalypse of John to the churches of Pergamos and Ephesus of the seven churches of Asia in Revelation 2 . It was a symbolic name of a party that represents the hierarchy of a ruling class over the rest of the people , developing a `` pecking order '' of fleshly leadership . Jesus hated this and warns the people to repent or else `` I will come upon you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth . '' The same warning illustration is applied to those that abused grace , which led to licentiousness from the example of Balaam , seducing Christians to fornication and tampering with idolatry . The individual overcomer is allowed to eat of the hidden manna and given a white stone with a new name written in it.The Early church father Iranaeus , identified the Nicolaitans in his treatise `` Against Heresies '' in the second century as they who are an `` offshoot of the knowledge which is falsely so-called , '' mentioning that they `` lead lives of unrestrained indulgence . '' There is no absolute proof that the heretic Nicolas was the Deacon of the same name from Antioch of the seven deacons in the book of Acts , but Iranaeus supposed him to be so . Ignatius mentions the Nicolaitans also , so there was in fact a heretical group existing at that time . Nicolas the deacon was perhaps confused with another Nicolas , the bishop Nicolas of Samaria who was a heretic in the company of Simon Magus.The root of the word Nicolaitans comes from Greek nikao , to conquer or overcome , and laos , which means people and which the word laity comes from . The two words together especially means the destruction of the people and refers to the earliest form of what we call a priestly order or clergy which later on in church history divided people and allowed for leadership other than those led by the spirit of the risen Lord Jesus Christ . A good translation of Nicolaitan would be `` those who prevail over the people . '' This clerical system later developed into the papal hierarchy of priests and clergy lording over the flock . The Council of Trent stated , `` If anyone shall say that there is not in the Catholic Church a hierarchy established by the divine ordination , consisting of bishops , presbyters and ministers , let him be anathema . '' It is not the question of the ministries but rather in the separation of them into a hierarchy over the people . This very idea was taken over by the Protestants with their own corruption of leadership roles and coverings . The Church of Ephesus was commended for hating the deeds of the Nicolaitans . The wrong separation of the clergy from the laity is a great evil in God 's sight and He hates the lust for religious power . There is an ungodly spiritual authority in the Church today , which is nothing more than the prideful spirit of control , manipulation , domination and intimidation and a rebellion of the rightful authority of God.Faithful believers who have put on Christ Jesus , are all God 's laity . Peter exhorted us to Feed the flock of God which is among you , taking the oversight thereof , not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind . Neither as being lords over God 's heritage but being examples to the flock . And when the chief shepherd shall appear , you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.Shepherds serve the sheep but the wolves that clothe themselves with so-called leadership and spiritual authority serve themselves , thinking that they serve God . In essence , this makes them false christs . Early church leaders were established as overseers , not a ruling hierarchy .",0
"How did we come to be here on the earth ? i mean what do you beleive creation or evolution ? It has to be creation , no accident ever produced anything that could work out so perfectly .

"why are banks for coins called piggy banks ? In Middle English , `` pygg '' referred to a type of clay used for making various household objects such as jars . People often saved money in kitchen pots and jars made of pygg , called `` pygg jars '' . By the 18th Century , the spelling of `` pygg '' had changed and the term `` pygg jar '' had evolved to `` pig bank . '' This name may have caught on because the pig banks were mostly used by children , and the pig is a child-friendly shape that is easy to fashion out of clay . The actual origin of the name bears no relation to the pig itself.What also helped to start the change from jar to pig was during the 18th century , an order of 200 `` pygg '' jars was sent for by a shop owner . The person on the receiving end of this letter did not understand and hand crafted 200 coin holders that were shaped like pigs . When this order was received they were shelved and sold very quickly . The new pig shaped coin holder became popular . Once the shop had run out of stock , they sent off for more pig-shaped coin holders .",0

"What should one do to gain respect in society and also for himself ? plz answer other than- `` give respect take respect '' I think it could be a mistake to `` gain respect in society . '' Society can screw itself . If you `` need '' society 's respect , they have power over you . Do you want to be in that situation ? ? ? ? Only you can truly know if you are worthy of respect . Whether they in society respond to you with respect can sometimes be in error . Some of the most respected people , say in a corporate work situation , are complete idiots -- not worthy of any respect at all , yet they are shown respect for all the wrong reasons . And who in society do you want respect from ? If you want respect from hip-hop rappers , then get some gold teeth , grab your crotch liberally , and wear pants that are falling to your knees . If you want respect from slimy salesmen , go work at a car dealership and make the most bonus of any person that week ... .Do you want respect from people in the local church ? That works great until you disagree with one of their beleifs ... ... ... The most important thing is that you become a person who respects himself -- regardless of others . That is truly of value . If you are looking for respect as a commodity , to be used as a tool for getting stuff from people , then I poo-poo it.So you need to define what qualities in yourself are worthy of respect . Curb the habits and things about you that you do n't respect , or accept that some things will never change and you are who you are . It will be a mix of both -- each of us is different , so you might as well embrace it .",0

"Who is MARAIH CAREY ? Mariah Carey , Singer Born : 27 March 1970 Birthplace : Huntington , New York Best Known As : Pop diva who sang `` We Belong Together '' Mariah Carey 's remarkable vocal range helped her gospel-influenced dance tunes reach the top of the pop charts in the early 1990s . Her hit albums included Mariah Carey ( 1990 ) , Music Box ( 1993 ) and Butterfly ( 1997 ) . Critics winked at Carey 's 1993 marriage to Tommy Mottola , the head of Sony Music and Columbia Records ( Carey 's label ) , but her vocal abilities and babe-appeal kept her in good standing with fans and made her a favorite on MTV . ( Carey and Mottola were divorced in 1998 . ) In 2001 Carey left Columbia to sign with EMI 's Virgin Records for a reported $ 100 million ; her first Virgin album , Glitter , the soundtrack to her semi-autobiographical 2001 movie , was widely considered a disappointment . In July of 2001 Carey was hospitalized for exhaustion , and the next month her publicists said that Carey was also receiving psychiatric treatment . The next year she split with EMI , which paid $ 28 million to buy out the remainder of her contract . By the end of 2005 she was at the top of the charts again , and her album , The Emancipation of Mimi , featuring the hit single , `` We Belong Together , '' earned 8 Grammy nominations .",0

In other words , the amount of the Moon that we can see changes over time in a cyclic period that repeats itself approximately once a month .

Notice that no matter what phase the Moon is in , HALF of it is ALWAYS lit by the Sun . ( Which half is always lit ? The half that is facing the Sun . ) The reason that we do not always see a Moon which is half lit is because of our position relative to the Moon and the Sun .
