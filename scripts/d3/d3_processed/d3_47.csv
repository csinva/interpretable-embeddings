"why is the Van Allen radiation belts have to surround to earth ? The Van Allen belts have very little to do with the earth 's core as the other answer suggested . They are believed to be created by the eath 's magnetic field interacting with charged particles known as solar wind . To the extent that we believe the earth 's core responsible for creating the earth 's magnetic field , I guess the earth 's core has some relevance . As the solar winds encounter the earth 's magnetic field , the radiation becomes trapped within the field . They are repelled from areas of stronger magnetic field where field lines converge . Two alternative hypotheses have been proposed . Possibly the Van Allen Belts are lefor over from the aurora , and another argument is that they are the result of volcanic activity of the earth . Some scientists beleive that they may have a beneficial effect on the planet providing some protection from solar wind , and that weakening them would harm both electronics and living organisms . there has been a proposal to reduce the charge of the belts , which are a hazard to satellites .",1

"May I Know which Organ Produces Blood PLasma ? I need it for school homework before 2 Febuary plz ! ! ! ! ! ! ! No organ produces Blood Plasma , it is a product of several organs or one could say the body . It consists of ( mostly ) water , salts ( electrolytes ) , and proteins ( albumin and antibodies being the majority ) . All the water , salts , and proteins ultimately are derived from the GI tract ; i.e. , what you eat . The water and salts are regulated by the renal system . Albumin is produced by the liver ( and it is in the majority for plasma protein ) and antibodies are a product of the immune system . There is also a balance of proteins and water within the vasculature ( intravascular space ) and without ( extravascular space ) . So , there is always an influx/efflux balance between your tissues and the vasculature depending on the osmostic pressure ( mostly ) and mechanical pressure . This is all in one giant balance or homeostasis most of the time . Hence , why it 's a good idea to see plasma as a total body product.I just read the above answers . Plasma is NOT produced in the bone marrow . Blood cells are produced in the marrow . Plasma is what you have left over when you remove those cells .",1
"Is there a free chemical test for Brass and/or Gold ? If you want to identify brass versus gold , try using some ammonia solution or vinegar on the metal . Brass has oxides which will be dissolved and the brass will come out much brighter . Gold does not oxidize and will not react . Highly polished brass will not have an oxide coat to remove , so you can test it by immersing it in a solution with 2/3 vinegar and 1/3 hydrogen peroxide solution , and leave it for more than fifteen minutes . If it is brass and not gold , the solution will begin to turn green as the copper in the brass begins to dissolve . Again , gold will not react .",1
"What is the church of scientology ? Literally , Scientology means the study of truth . Scientologists believe that man is an immortal spiritual being whose experiences extend far beyond just this lifetime . According to Scientology , man 's capabilities are unlimited , even if they are not presently realized.Scientologists believe that painful memories from our past can hinder our ability to realize our limitless potential . For this , Scientologists offer auditing which enables people to remove the painful effects of these bad memories . Practically , auditing is a type of counseling using a lie detetector called an E-meter . In auditing , the auditor never invalidates what the pre-clear says . The ultimate aim of auditing is so people can attain the state of `` Clear , '' or a state of freedom from painful past memories . Clears are free from psychosomoatic illnesses , self determined , vigorous and persistent.Scientology 's aims are a civilization without insanity , without criminals and without wars . Where the able can prosper , where honest beings can have rights and where man is free to rise to greater heights.For this purpose , Scientologists run many humanitarian organizations including Narconon and Criminon , helping people get off drugs , the Citizens Commission on Human Rights , which fights psychiatric abuse , the Applied Scholastics educational system and the Way to Happiness Foundation .",1

"How old is water ? How old is the water on earth ? Is it all the same age ? how did it get here ? That 's a good question . 'Our ' water is not quite as old as the Earth . Volcanic activity in the early formation of the planet was necessary for the release of H20 into the atmosphere ( in the form of steam ) and liquid water only appeared when the planet had cooled enough for that steam to condense.Volcanic eruptions continue to release trapped volatiles including H20 , so technically you might say that some water is younger than the rest.As for how else it might have got here , I found a theory that water arrived in 'snow comets ' ( make of that what you will ! ) see http : //www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0103/05smallcomet/ )",1

"whats the difference between distance and gravitational pull ? whats the difference between distance and gravitational pull I think you 're asking about the relationship between distance and gravitational pull.Gravitational pull weakens as the distance increases . The farther you are away from an object , the weaker the gravitational pull will be.We say that gravity is `` inversely proportional '' to distance - meaning as distance increases , gravity decreases , and as distance decreases , gravity increases.More specificially , gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance - meaning that if the distance increases by a factor of 2 , gravity decreases by a factor of 4 , and if the distance increases by a factor of 3 , gravity decreases by a factor of 9 .",1
"Can `` any humanbeing '' can touch the stars ... ? Stars are massive , glowing balls of hot gases , mostly hydrogen and helium . Some stars are extremely hot , while others are cooler . You can tell by the color of light that the stars give off . If you look at the coals in a charcoal grill , you know that the red glowing coals are cooler than the white hot ones . The same is true for stars . A blue or white star is hotter than a yellow star , which is hotter than a red star . Temperature of stars range in the high hundreds to thousands degrees F. So to touch the stars that are in the sky is almost impossible , as your body would burn due to high temperatures surrounding them .",1

"How did Dinosaurs died ? So much of them around the world . How could all of them die in one sweep ? Why did all of the remaining dinosaurs die out suddenly at the end of the Cretaceous period ? There is a short answer and a long answer to this question . 2 Here is the short answer . No one knows for sure . 3 Here is the long answer . There are a number of theories . Some are scientific , and some are ridiculous . Most scientists believe in one or two main ones , but no one knows for sure . 4 The reason no one knows for sure is because the whole thing happened about 65 million years ago . No one was around to see or hear what was going on back then , and no one was around to keep records . 5 What we do know comes mainly from fossil records . Scientists study the fossils themselves , and they study the rock in which the fossils are found . Fossil records have n't given us definite proof for any one theory . This is because there are some problems with fossil records . For one thing , most fossil evidence of dinosaurs has been found in North America . We do n't know as much about dinosaur activity on other parts of the earth . Another problem is that it is very hard to date fossils . Dating fossils means determining how old they are . 6 One really interesting thing about the big dinosaur question is that scientists from many different fields are working to solve the problem . Astronomers , physicists , geologists , paleontologists , ecologists , chemists , geologists and others are all gathering evidence , experimenting , and researching to try to solve the puzzle . 7 The most popular theory is called the Alvarez Hypothesis . This hypothesis says that , 65 million years ago , a big asteroid hit the earth . This asteroid crash scattered dust high up into the atmosphere . It blocked much of the sunlight and caused the earth to become cooler . The crash also started huge fires , high winds , and violent storms that killed some of the dinosaurs . The lack of sunlight and warmth caused many plants to die . This shortage of plants for food caused the rest of the dinosaurs to die out . 8 The second most popular theory says that activity on the earth itself caused the extinction . As the supercontinent of Pangaea was breaking up , movement of the earth 's giant land plates caused volcanoes to erupt and the climate to change . These changes affected the earth 's atmosphere and temperature , and the dinosaurs died out from the cold or from lack of plants to eat . 9 Other theories suggest that dinosaurs became so big that they could n't move , or that there were too many dinosaurs and they ate up all of the food .",1

"i want to know everything about GENETICS. ? Genetics , scientific study of how physical , biochemical , and behavioural traits are transmitted from parents to their offspring . The word itself was coined in 1906 by the British biologist William Bateson . Geneticists determine the mechanisms of inheritance whereby the offspring of sexually reproducing organisms do not exactly resemble their parents , and the differences and similarities between parents and offspring recur from generation to generation in repeated patterns . The investigation of these patterns has led to some of the most exciting discoveries in modern biology.Soon after Mendel 's work was rediscovered , scientists realized that the patterns of inheritance he had described paralleled the action of chromosomes in dividing cells , and they proposed that the Mendelian units of inheritance , the genes , are carried by the chromosomes . This led to intensive studies of cell division.Every cell comes from the division of a pre-existing cell . All the cells that make up a human being , for example , are derived from the successive divisions of a single cell , the zygote ( see Fertilization ) , which is formed by the union of an egg and a sperm . The great majority of the cells produced by the division of the zygote are , in the composition of their hereditary material , identical to one another and to the zygote itself ( assuming that no mutations occur ; see below ) . Each cell of a higher organism is composed of a jellylike layer of material , the cytoplasm , which contains many small structures . This cytoplasmic material surrounds a prominent body called the nucleus . Every nucleus contains a number of minute , threadlike chromosomes . Some relatively simple organisms , such as cyanobacteria and bacteria , have no distinct nucleus but do have cytoplasm , which contains one or more chromosomes.Chromosomes vary in size and shape and usually occur in pairs . The members of each pair , called homologues , closely resemble each other . Most cells in the human body contain 23 pairs of chromosomes , whereas most cells of the fruit fly Drosophila contain four pairs , and the bacterium Escherichia coli has a single chromosome in the form of a ring . Every chromosome in a cell is now known to contain many genes , and each gene is located at a particular site , or locus , on the chromosome.The process of cell division by which a new cell comes to have an identical number of chromosomes as the parent cell is called mitosis ( see Reproduction ) . In mitotic division each chromosome divides into two equal parts , and the two parts travel to opposite ends of the cell . After the cell divides , each of the two resulting cells has the same number of chromosomes and genes as the original cell ( see Cell : Division , Reproduction , and Differentiation ) . Every cell formed in this process thus has the same genetic material . Simple one-celled organisms and some multicellular forms reproduce by mitosis ; it is also the process by which complex organisms achieve growth and replace worn-out tissue.Higher organisms that reproduce sexually are formed from the union of two special sex cells known as gametes . Gametes are produced by meiosis , the process by which germ cells divide . It differs from mitosis in one important way : in meiosis a single chromosome from each pair of chromosomes is transmitted from the original cell to each of the new cells . Thus , each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes that are found in the other body cells . When two gametes unite in fertilization , the resulting cell , called the zygote , contains the full , double set of chromosomes . Half of these chromosomes normally come from one parent and half from the other.For more than 50 years after the science of genetics was established and the patterns of inheritance through genes were clarified , the largest questions remained unanswered : how are the chromosomes and their genes copied from cell to cell , and how do they direct the structure and behaviour of living things ?

"Why do Life Savers candy make blue sparks when you bite them ? It works the best with `` Wintogreen , '' rather than peppermint , and should be done with a fresh pack ( the moisture makes it spark better ) . The spark that comes from the Life Saver is considered as a type of triboluminescence , which the sugar in Life Savers contain . Here 's an excerpt from my source site : `` Wintergreen sparking , it 's believed , is actually a three-step process . Step One : When you shatter the sugar crystals with your teeth , electrons ( which are negatively charged ) break free . As a result , the atoms in which the electrons were formerly embedded become positively charged . In what amounts to a subatomic game of musical chairs , the free electrons dash around madly trying to find a new home . `` Step Two : Meanwhile , as the sugar crystals disintegrate , nitrogen molecules from the air attach themselves to the fractured surfaces . When the free electrons strike the nitrogen molecules , they cause the latter to emit invisible ultraviolet radiation , along with a faint visible glow . `` Step Three : The UV radiation is absorbed by the wintergreen flavoring , methyl salicylate . This then emits the fairly bright blue light you see . Pretty complicated , I admit . Clearly the planners in the Pentagon were n't the first to be obsessed with high-tech gimcracks . ''",1

"what are the advantages and disadvantages of using DSP over FPGA ? Programming a DSP is similar to programming any other type of microcontroller , except that it is designed with signal processing in mind . As such it is designed with extra multipliers and pipelines to allow faster signal processing . They also ( some do ) come with software libraries to implemented tested signal processing functions such as the fourier transform , and convolution.An FPGA is exactly what the name suggests : a programmable gate array . You program it as a piece of hardware . The FPGA basically implements look up tables and as such is good for doing complex logic very fast . Using languages such as VHDL and Verilog you can create complex logic structures . Many pre-writen FPGA cores exist that allow you to implement processors , multipliers , video/audio converters , network protocols ... just about anything . So an FPGA is extremely flexible . If you are looking to implement a complex system , then an FPGA is what you want.If you are using signal processing , and are testing an algorithm then a DSP would be best , as reprogramming an FPGA for signal processing tasks isnt as easy as it is for a DSP . You could how ever develop a DSP like FPGA core , but this would require extensive effort ... and unless you understood your algorithm well would waste development time.In the past I have with ease used an FPGA to build a system containing a processor , ethernet , serial ports , and 100s of digital I/Os ... this is exactly what they are suited for.Where as if i were building a digital equaliser for example , a DSP would be best .",1

"Explain how spectral observations ( red shift ) have led to the theory of the big bang. ? im in 10th garde and i need a detailed answerthank you Actually Einstein predicted the Big Bang before Hubble found the first observational evidence.Einstein found that in his theory of General Relativity that the universe as a whole should be either expanding or contracting . He did n't like this so he added an extra term the `` cosmological constant '' to balance the equations and have a universe that was not expanding or contracting . That sort of static universe was what was expected in those days.Meanwhile , Edmund Hubble began making observations in the 1920s from the Mt Wilson Observatory of distant `` nebulae . '' He had discovered previosuly that many of this faint blobs , previously thought to be gas clouds , were in fact galaxies like our own Milky Way . This was a big surprise since previosuly the Milky Way was the only galaxy , or what they called at the time , an `` island universe . `` So , it was natural for Hubble to look at the spectra of some of these distant galaxies . What he found was that , except for a couple of very nearby galaxies like M-31 the Andromeda Galaxy , all the other galaxies had shifted spectra . That is , these other galaxies has spectra which were redshifted , indicating that they were moving away from us.Further he found that the fainter galaxies ( which on average are farther away ) had the largest redshifts . This lead to the famous `` Hubble 's Law '' that says that the observed redshift is proportional to the distance a galaxy is from us.Einstein found out about Hubble 's discovery and realized what it meant - the whole universe is expanding . Although naively it looks like everything is moving away from us , all of space is expanding , so that an observor in any galaxy would detect the same thing - that every galaxy is moving away from them.The usual analogy is to think of rasins in rasin bread . As the bread rises all the dough ( space ) expands , so the distance between all rasins ( galaxies ) grows . Thus from any one rasin ( galaxy ) all the rest look like they are moving away.Einstein realized that his `` cosmological constant '' was unneccessary . He famously called it his `` greatest blunder '' and that he could have officially predicted the expansion of the universe before Hubble confirmed it with observations . ( And in fact , before Hubble 's discovery , other scientists like Willem de Sitter and Alexander Friedmann used the equantions of General Relativity to calculate an expanding universe . ) At that point it was realized that if space is expanding that in the past it must have been all bunched up in one spot . Just before Hubble Georges Lemaître realized this and thought that at first there was some sort of `` primaval atom '' from which everything else came from.Fred Hoyle did n't like Lemaitre 's idea at all , not the least of which was because Lemaitre insisted that God started the whole thing . Hoyle developed a rival theory the Steady State universe , and dismissed the other type of ideas as a `` hot big bang . '' Of course Hoyle 's term , meant as a put-down , became the offical name . ( Hoyle 's Steady State Theory was a serious rival to the Big Bang until the 1960s and the discovery of the microwave background . ) It was n't until 1948 that the modern aspects of the Big Bang were proposed by George Gamow and Ralph Alpher . These guys showed that from an initial explosion of compressed everything one would get the correct mixture of hydrogen and helium and other trace elements observed in the whole universe .

"How can you ? how can you tell that chlorine is a gas at room temperature ? Well , do you know about intermolecular forces ? There are four types of intermolecular forces : 1 . London dispersion2 . Dipole-dipole3 . Hydrogen bonding4 . Ion-dipoleThe weakest of these four forces is the first one , London dispersion , which happens to be the only one that chlorine molecules exert on each other . Chlorine molecules ( Cl2 ) are diatomic and nonpolar ( two identical atoms bonded together can not have polarity because they pull on the electrons with the same strength ) . That means that they only exert London dispersion forces on each other , which is weak . That means that chlorine molecules are n't really attached to each other that well , so they can just fly away from each other as gas very easily . This is why chlorine is a gas at room temperature , and that 's how you can tell ( or at least make a smart prediction ; it 's hard to know for sure ) with chlorine and other molecules and compounds . Figure out what kind of intermolecular forces you 're dealing with .",1

"What is the metal from which penny coins are made of ? Following is a brief chronology of the metal composition of the cent coin ( penny ) : * The composition was pure copper from 1793 to 1837 . * From 1837 to 1857 , the cent was made of bronze ( 95 percent copper , and five percent tin and zinc ) . * From 1857 , the cent was 88 percent copper and 12 percent nickel , giving the coin a whitish appearance . * The cent was again bronze ( 95 percent copper , and five percent tin and zinc ) from 1864 to 1962 . ( Note : In 1943 , the coin 's composition was changed to zinc-coated steel . This change was only for the year 1943 and was due to the critical use of copper for the war effort . However , a limited number of copper pennies were minted that year . You can read more about the rare , collectible 1943 copper penny in `` What 's So Special about the 1943 Copper Penny . '' ) * In 1962 , the cent 's tin content , which was quite small , was removed . That made the metal composition of the cent 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc . * The alloy remained 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc until 1982 , when the composition was changed to 97.5 percent zinc and 2.5 percent copper ( copper-plated zinc ) . Cents of both compositions appeared in that year .",1

Is there a price to be paid for this trend ? Has anyone done a study analyzing mental health in reference to the number of sexual partners a woman has ? Um , i strongly disagree with the person above me . But , the thing is , i too have not heard of a specific study done to analyze the mental health of women in relation to the number of sexual partners she has had . However , what i do know from speakers in various organizations , tell me that there is a real link to guilt and depression with the number of sex partners she has had in her life . Guilt when her husband knows that she has given away the gift reserved for husbands . ALthough her husband might not feel it 's a big deal , and has told her that , she still feels insecure . Depression may not be a direct cause of the number of sex partners , but it sure is related . Because when women have more sex partners , she increases her risk of becoming pregnant and contracting an STD with each partner she has . So , in the likelihood that she has become pregnant , she would most probably go for an abortion . And after the first abortion , she would be more likely to have more than one abortion . Increased abortions and HPV lead to cervical cancer and no children . And that leads to depression . It 's a sad state of affairs , but that is why more women are finding it hard to conceive and gets depressed because of it .",1
"Why does carbon form so many compounds ? There are lots of reasons why there are large number of organic compounds .I ’ m giving U few of them.Catenation : The tendency of an element to form chains of identical atoms is called catenation . This tendency is observed in the case of non-metals showing covalency of two or more . However , this property is maximum in carbon as it can combine with other carbon atoms by single , double or triple covalent bonds . The bonding can be extended to form long open chain ( straight or branched ) or closed ones . Catenation property depends upon the value of bond energy which is maximum in the case of carbon . Bond : C-C Si-Si S-S P-P N-N O-OBond energy : 83 54 54 50 39 35 ( approximately ) ( kcal/mol ) The stability or the strength of the bond decreases as the bond energy decreases . Hence , the tendency of catenation decreases in the following manner ; C > Si ~ S > P > N > OTendency to combine with other non-metals : Carbon has the ability to form strong covalent bonds with many other atoms such as H , O , S , N , Cl , Br , I , etc . The C-C bond energy is approximately equals to the magnitude of bond energies between carbon and various other atoms.Bond C-C C-H C-O C-Cl C-N C-BrBond energy 83.0 97.0 86.0 81.0 73.0 68.0 ( approximately ) ( kcal/mol ) Isomerism is one of the reason also .",1

An El Niño is associated with warm and very wet summers ( December-February ) along the coasts of northern Peru and Ecuador , causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme . The effects during the months of February , March and April may become critical . Southern Brazil and northern Argentina also experience wetter than normal conditions but mainly during the spring and early summer . Central Chile receives a mild winter with large rainfall , and the Peruvian-Bolivian Altiplano is sometimes exposed to unusual winter snowfall events . Drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the Amazon River Basin , Colombia and Central America.Direct effects of El Niño resulting in drier conditions occur in Indonesia , increasing forest fires , in the Philippines , and northern Australia . Drier than normal conditions are also generally observed in Queensland , inland Victoria , inland New South Wales and eastern Tasmania during June-August.West of the Antarctic Peninsula , the Ross , Bellingshausen , and Amundsen Sea sectors have more sea ice during El Niño . The latter two and the Weddell Sea also become warmer and have higher atmospheric pressure.In North America , typically , winters are warmer than normal in the upper Midwest states and Canada , while central and southern California , northwest Mexico and the southeastern U.S. , are wetter than normal . Summer is wetter in the intermountain regions of the U.S . The Pacific Northwest states , on the other hand , tend to be drier during an El Niño . During a La Niña , by contrast , the Midwestern U.S. tends to be drier than normal . El Niño is also associated with decreased hurricane activity in the Atlantic.Finally , East Africa , including Kenya , Tanzania and the White Nile basin , experiences in the long rains from March to May wetter than normal conditions . There also are drier than normal conditions from December to February in south-central Africa , mainly in Zambia , Zimbabwe , Mozambique and Botswana '' source : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_nino",1

"can someone explain the cell cycle to me in english please ... . ? my bio teacher makes no sense at alll ... . The cell cycle , or cell division cycle , is the cycle of events in a eukaryotic cell from one cell division to the next . It consists of interphase , mitosis , and usually cell division . The cell cycle is regulated by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases . Leland H. Hartwell , R. Timothy Hunt , and Paul M. Nurse won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of these central molecules in the regulation of the cell cycle.The phases of the cell cycle are : The G0 phase is a period in the cell cycle where cells exist in a quiescent state . The G1 phase is the first growth phase . S phase , during which the DNA is replicated , where S stands for the Synthesis of DNA . G2 phase is the second growth phase , also the preparation phase for the cell . M phase or mitosis and cytokinesis , the actual division of the cell into two daughter cells . A surveillance system , so-called `` checkpoints '' , monitor the cell for DNA damage and failure to perform critical processes . Checkpoints can block progression through the phases of the cell cycle if certain conditions are not met . For instance , there is a checkpoint which monitors DNA replication and keeps cells from proceeding to mitosis before DNA replication is completed . Similarly , the spindle checkpoint blocks the transition from metaphase to anaphase within mitosis if not all chromosomes are attached to the mitotic spindle.If this system senses a problem , a network of signaling molecules instructs the cell to stop dividing . They can let the cell know whether to repair the damage or initiate programmed cell death , a form of which is called apoptosis . Programmed cell death ensures that the damaged cell is not further propagated . For example , a certain protein , called p53 , acts to accept signals provoked by DNA damage . It responds by stimulating the production of inhibitory proteins that then halt the DNA replication process . Without proper p53 function , DNA damage can accumulate unchecked . A direct consequence is that the damaged gene progresses into a cancerous state . Today , defects in p53 are associated with a variety of cancers , including some breast and colon cancers.Some cells , such as neurons , never divide once they become locked in a G0 phase . However , recent data has shown that neurons undergoing cell death re-enter the cell cycle . Addition of cell cycle inhibitors prevent this type cell death called apoptosis .",1

"As earth gains weight , will it affect its rotation on its axis and its revolution around the sun ? Will the contniuous weight gain of earth affect the orbits of other planets and our solar system as well as the entire universe ? If the mass of the earth changes , then if we could `` weigh '' it on a scale , its weight would change . Changing the mass of the earth definitely affects its rotation rate , and its orbit , as well as all the other orbits of bodies in the solar system , including the sun , and of course , bodies outside the solar system . All of the laws of motion and gravity that the earth and the other bodies obey depend on the mass of the earth.How might mass of the earth change ? 1 . The earth is gaining mass every year from meteorites of course . The amount of material falling to earth is estimated to be between 37,000 and 78,000 tons per year ( see first reference ) .I am not sure if this includes material from the solar wind , or from the tails of comets , or from cosmic dust ( see below ) which are also sources of material from space that the earth gathers , but I believe it does . 2 . The earth is also losing material because we are now launching satellites and sending space vehicles off on missions . 3 . At the boundary of the atmosphere and space ( the exosphere ) where air can escape into space . The amount of air that is lost depends on how fast the ions , atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere are moving . I have including a web page that discusses this below . 4 . When radioactive material decays , it can emit electromagnetic radiation ( gamma rays ) that carry off a tiny amount of mass . Some of these gamma rays might make it all the way out of earth 's atmosphere , but very few I would imagine . I am not sure how to estimate this . It would definitely have to be balanced against the flood of radiation that the earth is being bathed in by the sun and by cosmic rays . Without doing any calculations , I would guess that the earth is probably experiencing a net gain of mass every year , and this increases the force of gravity between it and all the other celestial bodies . It also will make it spin more slowly , as the moment of inertia of the earth changes . However , the gain is very small . From the figures above , the earth 's mass increases by roughly 10^ ( -15 ) per cent per year ; that is , the earth experiences a gain of about 0.000000000000001 % per year .",1

"what is `` strain ? '' ? Strain describes the % change in length of an object in the same direction of the load . Strain is almost always used with the word stress which is the reason there is strain . Stress is a force distributed over an area . If you take a 1/2 '' diameter steel pin and it is 1 '' long and you put 100 lbs on one end and the other end on the ground , you put 100lbs/.20in*in or 500 psi into the pin . Now visualize the pin being crushed under this load . The 1 '' distance between the end faces is no longer 1 '' . Say a measurement shows that under this load the pin is 0.998 '' . The strain , measured in inches per inch , is the change .002 '' divided by the length . In this case .002/1=.002 inches per inch . So the strain would be .002 in/in . ( In real life , the strain from a 100 lb load on a steel 1/2 '' pin would be very difficult to measure . ) See Poisson 's ratio which specifically deals with the different strain rates based on material properties .",1

"Why do some people grind their teeth when they sleep ? Teeth grinding , or bruxism , is often related to stress . It also can be caused by crooked or missing teeth or by something that creates an abnormal bite , such as a high spot on a molar . To diagnose bruxism , dentists look for flattened spots on the teeth . Treatment includes smoothing down those high spots and behavior modification for stress reduction . Your dentist also may recommend a mouth guard or a custom-made splint to be worn at night . These prevent teeth from coming together , which interrupts the grinding and gives muscles a chance to relax.Here 's some more information : Bruxism can have a variety of psychological and physical causes . These include stress , the body 's reaction to poor tooth alignment , as a complication of severe brain injury , or as an uncommon side effect of some antidepressant medications .",1
"why female breasts are so large compared to other mammals ? if you consider that such a large and chubby organ would be disadvantegous for surviving , how do you explain the evolution of sumptuous female breasts ? i think most of you think that this is associated with breastfeeding . but many mammals breastfeed too , but they dont have such large organs , right ? what is the deal with those nice breasts ? can you figure out what is going on ? There is definitely some severe debate going on concerning this issue . Some have proposed women have prominent breasts as the result of natural or sexual selection . Suggesting since women with large breasts are considered more desirable they would have more suitors and as a result reproduce more often . Others argue that this concept myopic because its based solely on modern Western society 's ideals of what is considered attractive . Those folks would suggest that breast size has seldom been of major importance in most societies . In the majority of societies breasts are just a source of nourishment for infants and young children . Whereas there is a relatively important argument against the latter argument in favor of the former . It would be difficult to believe that there is some `` natural selection '' root for the `` modern western society '' propensity of finding women with large breasts attractive . It would seem unlikely that these sorts of pervasive ideals toward the female form would simply appear out of thin air -- that 's giving Playboy a lot of credit I think.Then minimalistic view of why female breasts become so prominant is that the development of the female breast during puberty is likely the side affect of some biological necessity that is not readily apparent . Perhaps it is simply that human females experience a greater increase in estrogen levels during puberty than do other mammals.I do have to admit that I like the theory mentioned above about the need for larger to prevent suffococation while breast feeding , however , I would reckon that a major contribution to increased breast size may be the increased fatty content of our diet . This may be an explanation for why past cultures did n't have an affinity toward large breasts , because of the lack of high fat content in their diet , there were few women who displayed large breasts . However , because diet was usually a representation of status , there were many female members of aristocracic classes throughout time who were viewed as the most beautiful women of their day . These women tended to be rather Rubenesque . So , maybe it was already engrained in the human race early on.So , it 's not well known the mechanism by which female breasts have become more promenent in comparison to other mamals . Which leads me onece again to my soap box : When it comes to biology/evolution , it 's impossible to answer much of anything when it comes to `` why . '' Things happen for reasons , but very little of -- if any -- biology happens for a reason . Breasts are n't more prominent in the human species when compared to other mammalian species because of any designed reason . It could be that women with bigger breasts are more likely to mate , or mate more often , than women with smaller breasts , maybe it is our diet , whatever the reason that allows for breast sizes to increase , the genetics that allow for this to happen was determined by hundreds of the thousands -- if not millions -- of years of selective pressures that selected these genes as the most fit . These pressures have altered and molded these genes to their current status .",1

"what is the purpose of the reverse stapling feature of a stapler ? On a hand stapler you have a silver metal anvil on the base of the stapler . This anvil is where the staple legs are formed either in an inward ( standard clinch ) or outward ( pinning ) fashion . If your staples are forming outward , this means that the anvil has been turned . To resolve , push the button under your anvil upward . This will raise the anvil , now rotate the anvil 180 degrees . This will change the position of the forming slots.Pinning ( the staple legs are formed outward ) is an old style of securing papers . You would be able to remove the staple without damaging your papers , and add additional papers . One draw-back to this style of fastening is that the staple leg is exposed and will catch on other objects .",1

"does outter space ever end ? ? The best guess today : no.In modern cosmology the topology of the universe appears to be open . `` Topology '' meaning the shape , although in the case of the universe to observe the shape we would have to exist in 4 spatial dimensions . Since we 're stuck in 3-dimensions we have to get by on analogies.The topology or shape of the universe is something which comes out of Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity . It depends primarily on the distribution of mass and energy in the universe . If the amount of mass-energy is more than a certain critical value then the universe would be `` closed . '' Basically the mass would curve space-time back onto itself . In a closed universe you could fly off in the direction of the north pole and ( after about 25 billion years ) and circle the universe to land on the south pole.If the amount of mass in the universe is less than this critical value then the topology of the universe is a bit more complex , but , to answer your question space would be infinite.Based on what we know today that is the case , space is infinite.However , we can not see an infinite universe . When we see things that are farther away we also see them from deeped in the past . A galaxy we see that is 10 billion light years distant is actually a view of what the galaxy looked like 10 billion years in the past.When we look farther in space , and thus earlier in the history of the universe , we eventually run into the microwave background . For the first 10,000 years or so after the Big Bang the universe was so dense that it was n't yet transparent . When the density dropped enough to be transparent then some of the light could escape for us to detect much later.However , while the universe is thought to be about 13 billion years old , we can actually see out a bit farther than that , I think around 20 billion light years , because the universe is expanding.What this boils down to is that there is a sort of `` wall '' beyond which we ca n't see . This wall corresponds to a time soon after the Big Bang . However , studies of the total mass-energy within the universe strongly suggest that it has an open topology - that it is infinite . ( Of course it is possible that this infinity will be refined when we have a better theory of how Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity play togther . String Theory is one way to combine these two . )",1

"Is time travel ( to the future ) possible even in theory ? If we somehow accelerate to a speed greater than that of light , travelling to the past might make sense . But travelling to future ? It hasnt happened yet ! Then how ? One type of time travel occurs routinely here and now : our inexorable one-way drift into the future . Einstein 's special theory of relativity revealed the possibility of accelerated travel into the future Suppose a person spends a year in a rocket that 's traveling slightly less than the speed of light . Because motion at such enormous speeds drastically slows the clock for the traveler , that person could return to Earth to find that many years had elapsed at home . In that way , a traveler could leap into the future .",1

"what is the order of the magnitude of the power of a light source so that the photons can knock me over ? To Skully : I often jump too quickly to answer a question , but it 's a bad habit . Solar sails and radiometers : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sailhttp : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes_radiometerIn fact , light is responsible for the motion of all electrons.As for the original question , I 'm going to assume that you 're a two meter long ( rather tall , actually ) 65 kilogram plank . Your center of gravity would have to be displaced about .25 meters ( off your feet ) to tip you over . Gravity exerts a maximum torque of about 80 N*m on you . At the top of your head , that torque produces 40 newtons . When it 's reflected , light exerts a `` pressure '' of 2*I/c where I is the intensity of light ( in watts per meter^2 ) . Multiplying both sides by area and plugging this into my calculator produces about 6 billion watts ( and remember , that 's if you wear a reflective surface on your head and it 's only enough to tip you over , not actually knock you down ) . I 'd say you 're pretty safe from sudden `` light gusts '' .",1

"Why does the heavy part of a class ring spin on top when the ring is spun but stationary moves to the bottom. ? When a child 's top is spun , the point is down and the heavy part up while spinning but when it slows down it topples over , the same happens to a class ring when spun . Why ? The rotational energy you impart to the object when spinning overcomes the force of gravity that would topple a stationary object . A total layman 's explanation : A perfect stationary top perfectly balanced will not fall over . In real life though , it 's impossible to perfectly balance a top . It 's shape practically guarantees that its center of gravity will not be directly over the balance point for any practical length of time . Imperfections in the material will cause a slightly uneven weight distribution , air currents will introduce a small force , and mechanical vibrations will be transmitted through the medium the top rests on . The upshot of all this is that as soon as the center of mass is no longer over the resting point , gravity is going to pull the top over . Now gravity has an acceleration of 32 feet per second squared ( if I remember my ancient high school course correctly ) . It can only topple the top at a specific speed . If you spin the top fast enough , any side that gravity tries to `` pull down '' will translate around so quickly that it literally has no time to fall . If you were standing on a planet with a much higher gravity , you 'd have to spin the top far faster to achieve stability , and if you were on the moon , it would spin for a much longer time . Eventually , however , the top starts to slow and the tip will inscribe little circles . That action is called `` precession '' . And of course , eventually the thing drops to the table and the game is all up once it slows enough.Again , that 's a layman 's view of how it works . Some college physics major is probably going to come in here and make my answer look really foolish .",1

"What are the main aplications of `` Chaos Theory '' ? There have not been many direct applications of chaos theory so far , but the study of chaos and the emphasis on understanding chaos has given us new methods of research.One of the best examples I can think of is agent-based modelling in social sciences . For example , in theoretical combat , there is an old equation called Lanchester 's equation of combat , which predicts the casualty rate in a given time period for two different armies o fgiven sizes with given accuracies . Unfortunately , it tends not to be terribly accurate in numerical forescasts of battle outcomes . This is because the battle outcome depnds on the behavior of individual troops on the battlefield , and small changes in their behavior can cause big changes in battle outcome.The idea that small changes in an input cause big changes in an output is the essence of chaos theory . This has led to agent based modelling in which researchers assign behavioral attributes to individual troops rather than use a single variable to define a whole army . The computer calculates each troops interation with his own troops and with the enemy 's , and you get an outcome . Small changes in troop behavior will cause large changes in outcome . This can tell researchers what behaviors of soldiers may be most important to modify even slghtly.Observations of very different outcomes from small changes in starting conditions have led reserachers in all sorts of other fields to also attempt to understand this difference . Chemical engineers are often trying to understand tubulence and how small changes in pipe shapes can casue big changes in the way fluid flows .",1

"do fish drink water ? Web research seems to indicate that most fish do drink plenty of water , some continuously . Some fish absorb water through their skin and/or gills , and may excrete water that way , too . Apparently , fish need to maintain a fairly high concentration of salt , so how a fish deals with this need depends on whether it is a saltwater or freshwater fish . Most saltwater fish get enough or too much salt , and so preventing water loss is their concern . Freshwater fish are short on salt , and since water dilutes sodium , they have many mechanisms for excreting water . It is interesting to note that kidneys process water for excretion , so some saltwater fish have dysfunctional kidneys or are missing kidneys to help prevent water loss . The four `` water/salt '' strategies are listed below : -- -- -- Admin Note : The problem with fish vs. watery environment has do with the process of osmosis , defined as 'net movement of water molecules through a semipermeable membrane from a dilute solution to a more concentrated solution . The 'membrane ' is the 'skin ' or any other part of the fish that separates it from the water . If the concentration of salts and other solutes in the fish is greater than the outside , watery world , the fish takes on water ( natural attempt to 'dilute the fish to what it 's like outside ' - bad for the fish ) . In scientific terms the fish is hypertonic to its surroundings ( freshwater fish , e.g. ) . If a fish is hypotonic to its environment ( marine fish ) , then the seawater has a higher solute concentration than the fish ; the fish loses water to its surroundings ( also bad for the fish ) . Kidneys function to overcome the effects of osmosis so fishX can stay either more or less concentrated than its environment. -- -- --",1

"Will we ever evolve to Homo sapiens futuria as it has been predicted ? Is nature that predictable I would have to disagree with David to some extent .

"do u people think ice age will come back agein ? I have an MS in paleoclimatology , and I have to say that it is one of the most fascinating topics Ive ever delved into . It 's also amusing to see non-scientist 's responses here and on other message boards ! If you wanted to ask a scientist , you would have to define what you mean when you say `` ice age . '' There are varying degrees of `` ice ages . '' For brevity sake , I will assume you mean the relatively cold periods that last approximately 100,000 years that have dominated global climate for the last 2 million years . Contrary to popular belief , there are periods during the `` ice ages '' that are almost as warm as today.Based on paleoclimate evidence that suggest the ice ages have come and gone at least six times in the last 2 million years , the probability is that it will occur again.The difficult and possibly dramatic question is : when ? Seeing as though the last `` ice age '' generally ended about 12,000 years ago ( this is debatable , since there is no one date where everywhere across the globe it suddenly became warm ) , and the average interglacial is 10,000 years , we are overdue.Consider the widely accepted hypothesis that `` global warming '' -- whether it be natural , human-induced , or a combination -- can ultimately ( Ill spare you the details ) lead to an ice age . Melting polar sea ice , indicator species dying off in the tropics , large disintigrations of ice shelves in the Antarctic , estimations that global sea level may rise 4 inches in the next 100 years , `` wild '' weather in many parts of the US ... are these all tell-tale signs that we have already begun down the road to the next glacial period ? ! ? ! ?

"Why Were The Days of the Week Named After The Solar System ? I was just curious . I know that Sunday is named after the Sun . Monday=Moon , Tuesday=Mars , Wed.=Mercury , Thur.=Jupiter , Friday=Venus , & Sat.=Saturn ... But why exactly ? . Was it believed that those days revolved around each of those planets at that time ? or what ? Thanks . A long time ago in human history , people thought that Earth was flat , and at the universe 's center . They believed that seven members of the solar system forever circled around us—see graphic to the right , or view one from Censorinus - Sur le jour natal . Some Mediterranian peoples also believed that each hour of the day was ruled by either the Sun , Moon or one of five then-known planets , all of which were thought of as gods . The sequence in which they thought hours were governed was the inverse order of distance they believed those solar system objects to be from Earth . During this time , Egyptians thought that the most distant was Saturn , shown at the bottom of the graphic above . They thought that the order of closer members ( shown counterclockwise following Saturn ) was Jupiter , Mars , Sun , Venus , Mercury and closest , the Moon . So they believed that the first hour was ruled by Saturn , the second by Jupiter and so on . Egyptians also believed that after each seven hours the order in which these objects ruled was repeated , so it started again with Saturn . According to those ancient Egyptians , the planet that ruled the first hour also governed the entire twenty-four hour period , and gave its name to that day . The first ( and also the 8th , 15th and 22nd ) hours of the first day were sacred to Saturn , the 23rd to Jupiter , the 24th to Mars and the first hour of the next day to the Sun . Therefore , they believed that the first day was ruled by and named after Saturn ( Saturday ) and the second was ruled by ( and named after ) the Sun ( Sunday ) . Egyptians once divided all twelve 30-day months ( of their 360-day calendar year ) into three 10-day weeks in the same manner as Greeks of the same period . The epoch at which planet worship caused them to change its length to seven days is not known , but it must have been over twenty-five hundred years ago because Herodotus , writing in his History during the 5th century B.C . said : `` Here are some other discoveries of the Egyptians . They find ... each day belongs to a god ... '' Adherents of the cult of Sin at Harran , who were known as Harranians or Sabeans by Arabic and Syrian authors , named their days after the same solar system members as Egyptians and Persians . Like Hebrews and many other peoples , they considered the one named after Saturn to be the seventh day , so they began their week with a day named after the Sun . All seven days were named after solar system members in the same order as they were in Egypt . It is interesting to note that these exact same solar system objects , and in the same sequence , were also used to name days in ancient India , Tibet and Burma . This is also true of names for Japanese days of the week , but the custom there has been traced back only a thousand years . Roman soldiers stationed in Egypt became accustomed to the pagan seven-day week and began to introduce it into their own homeland to replace their eight-day marketing week . Octavian ( Caesar Augustus ) and succeeding Roman rulers permitted this practice but it was n't made official until the emperor Constantine took that step in A.D. 321 . English names for days of the week are derived from Anglo-Saxon names for those same seven heavenly bodies that were revered by ancient peoples . Compare those English and Anglo-Saxon day names in the table below . Other similarities between day and `` planet '' names in various countries can be observed there .",1

"is there any care or prevention for demintia or alzymers disease ? I have heard that using your brain more can help delay or prevent Alzheimers , though not scientifically proven . Puzzles like Mensa , Soduku , brain teasers may help.Efforts to find effective treatments for Alzheimer 's after-the-fact have so far been disappointing . Age is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer 's . The baby boom is approaching its golden years . Indeed , much of the concern about the solvency of governmental social safety nets is founded on estimates of the costs of caring for baby boomers , assuming that they develop Alzheimer 's in the same proportions as earlier generations.One study ( `` Leisure Activities and the Risk of Dementia in the Elderly , '' New England Journal of Medicine [ 8 ] ) found that people who played chess on a regular basis went on to get Alzheimer 's at a substantially lower rate than the general population . The chess relationship was stronger than any other factor , including dancing and solving crossword puzzles , both of which were also shown to be inversely proportional to getting Alzheimer 's disease.In a number of retrospective studies , regular physical exercise has appeared to be inversely related to the development of Alzheimer ’ s . The Alzheimer 's risk of those exercising regularly was half that of the least active . This research is consistent with the observation that virtually all measures designed to promote cardiac fitness and reduce stroke risk also seem to reduce Alzheimer 's risk . However in one study , dance appeared to be the only exercise effective in reducing risk . One explanation is that dancing requires the use of complex mental skills such as performing correct steps while at the same time keeping track of the music . The presence of cardiovascular risk factors -- diabetes , hypertension , high cholesterol and smoking -- in middle age ( ages 40 to 44 ) was found very strongly associated with late-life dementia ( Neurology 2005 ; 64:277-281 .

"Why does metal spark in the microwave ? The short answer is : Microwaves bombard the metal with radio waves ( electrons ) . Where that energy builds up , it can build to the point the energy will arc to another spot . Works great with crumpled foil , or CD-ROM 's you do n't want to use anymore . Quoth Wikipedia : `` ... the pointed ends of the fork will act to concentrate the electric field formed at the tips . This has the effect of exceeding the dielectric breakdown gradient of air , about 3 megavolts per meter ( 3×106V/m ) , causing sparks to form . This effect is directly analogous to the effect of St. Elmo 's fire. '' P.S . According to Mythbusters , you CAN NOT damage your microwave by putting metal objects in it for short periods of time . You would have to microwave metal a LOT for it to overload the magnetron and cause damage ( most magnetrons in consumer microwaves have overload protection anyway ) .

"what is the function of stipules ? wha is the importance of stipules ? There are a number of interesting functions demonstrated for stipules of certain plant species.Also protection of emerging leaves . 1 . Stipules that are green may be leaf-like ( Examples : flowering quince , a geranium , and a sycamore ) , linear , thread-like , or reduced to minute scales , thereby requiring a hand lens to see . Plant biologists have assumed that green stipules are photosynthetic , but ecophysiologists generally have not determined how significant green stipules may be as temporary or persistent photosynthetic structures . Anatomical reports on photosynthetic stipules are exceedingly rare , so that we know little about the presence of stomates and the nature of the mesophyll in stipules . 2 . If hardened with lignin , a stipule may become modified as a spine , i.e. , a stipular spine . In many species , one stipular spine or a pair of stipular spines may be observed at each node , e.g. , among legumes , and for legumes , the stipular spine is the typical type of shoot armature ( Examples : coral tree , Chloroleucon , and a mimosa ) . Obviously , stipular spines were effective in their specific native habitat for many of these cases as an adaptation to reduce predation by vertebrate herbivores . Very large , hollow stipular spines in certain species of bull acacia ( Acacia , Family Mimosaceae ) serve as homes for ants , which defend the plant from all other herbivores . Stipular spines are extremely important forms of shoot armature for the succulent euphorbs ( Family Euphorbiaceae ; examples : crown-of-thorns , young stipular spines , and old stipular spines ) , most species of which occur in thorny scrub and woodland as well as desert habitats in Africa and southern Asia . Stipular spines also are present on certain climbers . 3 . In many groups of plants , stipules are short-lived , nonphotosynthetic structures that abscise before the leaf is fully expanded ( a legume ) . Such stipules tend to be nongreen , often hyaline ( an elm ) , off-white ( ramie ) , yellow , or brownish , but there are some remarkable cases where the stipule is brilliantly colored , especially with anthocyanins , red to purple vacuolar pigments ( Talauma hodgsonii ) . A nongreen stipule probably can be regarded as vestigial , lacking any function for the mature leaf and shoot but perhaps protecting the young leaf while it is at the growing tip . 4 . Sometimes stipules and stipels have evolved as extrafloral nectaries , utilized to nourish mutualistic ants , or other types of glands . 5 . In Smilax , a lianaceous monocotyledon , the stipule may develop as a tendril . 6 . For whatever function , corky stipules are known from certain dryland shrubs , for example , the species of creosote bush ( Larrea young stipules of L. tridentata and older stipules in L. nitida ) in New World deserts and the tough-leaved evergreen species of Ceanothus in California chaparral .",1
"What is the theory of relativity ? I have gotten mixed information on this subject , and would like to know the truth . Any resources would be great . Wellrelativity Physical theory , introduced by Albert Einstein , that discards the concept of absolute motion and instead treats only relative motion between two systems or frames of reference . One consequence of the theory is that space and time are no longer viewed as separate , independent entities but rather are seen to form a four-dimensional continuum called space-time . Full comprehension of the mathematical formulation of the theory can be attained only through a study of certain branches of mathematics , e.g. , tensor calculus . Both the special and general theories have been established and accepted into the structure of physics . Einstein also sought unsuccessfully for many years to incorporate the theory into a unified field theory valid also for subatomic and electromagnetic phenomena.Evolution from Classical TheoryThe modern theory is an extension of the simpler Galilean or Newtonian concept of relativity , which holds that the laws of mechanics are the same in one system as in another system in uniform motion relative to it . Thus , it is impossible to detect the motion of a system by measurements made within the system , and such motion can be observed only in relation to other systems in uniform motion . The older concept of relativity assumes that space and time are correctly measured separately and regards them as absolute and independent realities . The system of relativity and mechanics of Galileo and Newton is perfectly self-consistent , but the addition of Maxwell 's theory of electricity and magnetism to the system leads to fundamental theoretical difficulties related to the problem of absolute motion .",1

"someone tell me inlaymans terms , why it is impossible for physical objects to travel at the speed of light ? Here are two explanations ( neither particularly satisfying I will tell you in advance . ) The first is that the speed of light ( in a vaccuum ) is a property of the universe that is measured the same by everyone , regardless of their motion relative to anyone else . This is a true statement born out by experiment , but it implies some very weird stuff . One is that distance and time are not measured the same by people in relative motion . Another is that you can never get closer to a beam of light going away from you ( i.e . go faster than the speed of light ) . If you could , you would measure the speed of light differently than someone else , and you would be special . The basic idea behind relativity is that , with regard to the laws of physics , no one is special . The second unsatisfying answer is E=mc^2 . In order to go faster , you have to accelerate . Acceleration takes energy , and an accelerating body has more mass than a body in a constant state of motion ( increase E in that equation m has go up , because c is the constant speed of light ) . It just so happens that the mass does n't go up in proportion to the rate of acceleration , but in relationship to how close you are to the speed of light . Everytime you halve the distance between your speed and the speed of light , your mass doubles , and the amount of effort needed to get that next bit of acceleration doubles . Getting to the speed of light would require infinite energy .",1

"How does temperature affect the taste of food and drink ? For example , white wine , tap water , Cointreau , lager and even chocolate taste much better cold . On the other hand , tea , coffee and brandy , as well as most cooked meals , taste much better warm or hot . English beer and red wine are better at room or cellar temperature . Why ? Heat amplifies smell , and most of `` taste '' is actually based on smell . Without smell , coffee and chocolate would just be bitter anf gross . So aromatic things smell more strongly . Cold also delays the taste of things , so cold chocolate probably loses enough of the bitterness by being cold , while retaining enough aroma , such that that might make it better . Of course , if you like your chocolate bitter ( like I do ) you wo n't prefer it cold for taste reasons . I think cold chocolate -- especially dark chocolate -- is too tasteless.Occasionally there is a matter of texture as well . With chocolate , for instance , I 'd dispute that it tastes better cold , but it is certainly less melty . With beer/lager/ale , heat can make it go flat , which affects its taste , but with liquor , the intense burn of the alcohol makes the burn worse . Aromatic liquors like brandy/cognac and whiskey/scotch are heated to allow the aromas to be stronger , but really , most all alcohol is innately gross , and is an acquired taste -- so people tend to learn to like them in particular ways , but I do n't think any of it is particularly innate . Cognac , scotch , and fine wine all take years to `` learn '' to appreciate .",1

"Why ca n't a praying mantis be enlarged 80 times its size and survive ? A giant mantis has two reasons not to survive.To sum the consequenses up , a giant prayer mantis has difficulty taking in oxygen ; can not fly ; and will collapse.The first , the oxygen thing . Just as the previous answer indicates , insects intake oxygen via diffusion.Picture a room with perfect still air , like a cellar . Suppose you put an open bottle of perfume at one end of the room . Some time later , you can smell the perfume at the other end of the room . There 's no air current in the room to bring the fragrant to you . It 's the perfume molecules , they wander around randomly . Some of them find their way into your nostrils so you can smell them . You will be able to smell the perfume sooner in a smaller room because the molecules have to wander through a shorter distance.The blood of insects does not carry oxygen , they have a series of air-filled tubes ( called trachea , plural tracheae ) all over their body , opening to some 'port-holes ' ( called spiracles ) along their abdomen . Most of insects are so small that the oxygen molecules , once entered the spiracles ( port-holes ) , do n't have long to wander along the tubes before reaching their destination -- the organs where they are consumed . Now , suppose the same insect is enlarged 80 times its length . The airway is also enlonged 80 times . It would take a LOT more time for oxygen to wander along this super long tube . During that time , the organs would have consumed all the oxygen around them without new oxygen coming in . So they die , and the insect dying with them.However this is only the case for small insects . Larger insects actually have air-bags withing their body to make a breeze along their tracheae ( air tubes ) to bring in oxygen . Quoting from the sourse page , `` Larger insects , such as grasshoppers and wasps , have internal air sacs connected to their tracheae . These insects speed up their gas exchange by squeezing the sacs to make them suck air in from outside . '' I 've no idea whether a prayer mantis has air sacs or not , but I 've seen one bigger than any grasshoppers or wasps I ever saw . Nevertheless , a giant prayer mantis would need much more powerful air sacs than the grasshoppers'.Now come to the second reason . Size . We will look at the two consequences of a super-huge size seperately.Think of a car on a highway . It can drive over 100 feet in a matter of seconds -- let 's say 2 seconds , so it 's speed is 50 feet per second . Now the car shrinks to the size of a prayer mantis . In the same 2 seconds , how far can it drive now ? 1 feet , more or less , so it 's speed is 0.5 feet per second . We see that the mini car is much slower . But the driver , who shrank with the car , he thinks he 's driving as fast ! Now think of the mantis , and think of a helicopter . The mantis flies much slower than the helicopter , just like the mini car is slower than the real car . And we have it that the faster things move through the air , the more resistance they experience . The helicopter flies fast , so its shape must be streamlined , as to reduce air resistance . The prayer mantis flies slow , so he does n't care much about air resistance , he can have any cool shape he desires . But for a giant mantis ? He would move much faster , and experience so much air resistance that with his cool shape ( not much streamlined ) he wo n't be able to fly at all.Let 's face the second consequence . Has anyone ever made a jelly block 5 feet long , 5 feet wide and 5 feet high ? What will happen if such a giant jelly is constructed ? It would collapse right away and flow like water . But any half-inch long , half-inch wide , half-inch high jelly block would stay all right in one 's spoon . What happens when the jelly grows in size ? For each bit of jelly in the bottom , there 's simply much more jelly on top of it ! And when that bit of jelly can no longer bear the burden , it breaks itself and flow away so that it wo n't have to support any more . So th",1

"A Statistical Evaluation of Multiplicative Congruential Generators ? what the main idea ? This is a cool question . The main idea is to check how random a random number generator really is.A random number generator is a system , usually involving a computer which creates a list of random numbers . All random number generators are really pseudo-random , which just means that unless there is some bizzare input , like static from a radio , the list of numbers is predictable and therefore not really random.For example an example of a simple random number generator is one of a pair of dice . The die will always show a number from 1 to 6 . If you wrote down zillions of rolls of the die , and made a bar chart , a really fair die would show equal length bars for each number . This is an example of an Statistical Evaluation . Other evaluations might be to show what the bar chart curve looks like ( bell curve etc . ) , or the average etc.Fair random number generators are important for gambling machines , state lotteries , scientific testing , and mathematics.The most famous multiplicative linear congruential generator was RANDU invented by IBM in 1968 . By multiplying numbers together one after another using modulo arithmetic ( like the way a clock repeats every 12 hours ) based on a starting number or SEED , it was a simple way to get numbers .

It is a continuous stream of photons emitting from the laser . After they leave the laser , they continue traveling on the same straight line they were on at the moment they left the laser . It does n't matter how the laser moves after that , because there is no force connecting the photons back to the laser .",1

"dealing with conceptual physics..where can i find help with my homework ? the question is ... the weight of the atmosphere above 1 square meter of the earths surface is 100,000 newtons . If the density of the atmosphere were a constant 1.2 kg/m3 , calculate where the top of the atmosphere would be . hecka hard ! ! ! any suggestions ? hecka ! ! damn . i miss california.what you have to do is realize that this question is asking about the volume of a rectangular shape that is 1 meter by 1 meter by X meters , where X is the height of the column.so , you know the density.. density is defined as mass divided by volume . and you know the weight.. which is mass times acceleration . here the acceleration is the acceleration of gravity `` g '' = 9.8 m/s^2 . so you can do a little algebra to get the equation volume = mass / density volume = weight / ( acceleration * density ) you know the weight ( 100,000 N ) , the acceleration ( 9.8 m/s^2 ) and the density ( 1.2 kg/m^3 ) . plug those numbers in and you get the VOLUME of the atmosphere , and since you know 2 of the dimensions of the box ( it is 1 square meter across the bottom face , remember ) you can figure out the 3rd pretty easily.since this is your homework i wont just tell you the answer , but you should be pretty much able to crank it out from here .",1

"I need to know the physics behind a helicopter 's flight. ? I need to know how a helicopter flies ( with equations , if possible ) and the possible problems a helicopter may experience in-flight . Thanks . Well , the physics of a helicopter is a very complex subject , but in essence it is only the blades of the helicopter pushing air down on the ground to lift it . The reason it starts to become complex is because the weight of the helicopter is thrown into the equation and the blades of it work in circular motion . The helicopter does have a coefficient of friction against it , which does not help the simplicity . The blades are angled to enhance the lift momentum . they´re 3 types of blades for helicopters and planes : BLADES WITH NO ANGLE ATACK , WITH SLIGHT ANGLE ATACK AND WITH STEP ANGLE ATACK.Also the blades spin in one direction , forcing the helicopter to actually spin in the other direction : Without the rear blade the helicopter would just spin due to Newton 's third law and action-reaction forces . The third law states that `` when one object exerts a force on a second object , the second exerts a force on the first that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction '' Action-Reaction forces means that for every force that the blades exerts , the body of the helicopter will spin proportional.The Rotor , blades in the rear , keep the helicopter going straight . They always oppose the force made by the blades.IN THE SOURCE PAGE I GAVE YOU YOU´LL FIND ALL THE EQUATIONS AND ANSWERS YOU NEED ABOUT THIS TOPIC .",1
"Can heat ( chemical symbol Q ) move from a cold object to a hot one ? my guess is yes , but that , overall , heat moves from hot to cold . any chemists out there ? Heat is the measure of internal energy that an object has . Heat flows from a hotter object to a colder object only . The internal energy flows from the higher level to the lower level . This is similar to flowing water . The water in a lake at the top of the hill has more potential energy than the water in the lake at the bottom of the hill . The water will flow downhill only . The water flows from the location where it has a higher energy level to the location where it can have a lower energy level .",1
"Why do electrical outlets have 2 different sized sockets ? Wall sockets have AC voltages , so there is no positive and negative . One of the two prongs has what is called `` Hot '' , and the other is called `` Neutral '' . The Neutral is connected to ground back at a distribution center , while the Hot is 110 Volts AC ( in the U.S. ) . By the time it gets to your home , the Neutral is not quite ground anymore , but is still relatively safe- wheras the Hot is quite dangerous and potentially deadly.Some appliances are designed to have extra protection between the Hot and people . For example , a light socket has the 'threads ' ( the easily touched part ) connected to Neutral . As another example , most appliances and the light switches disconnect the Hot when they are off.The different sizes of the sockets prevent you from plugging an applicance in backwords . If you did this , then the switch would disconnect the Neutral instead , and leave the Hot on- making the device less safe .",1

"what is your definition of myoelastic-aerodynamics ? ? ? Myoelastic-aerodynamic TheoryEarly voice researchers in the 1950 's and 1960 's explained vocal fold oscillation with the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory . According to these theories , Bernoulli forces ( negative pressure ) cause the vocal folds to be sucked together , creating a closed airspace below the glottis . Continued air pressure from the lungs builds up underneath the closed folds . Once this pressure becomes high enough , the folds are blown outward , thus opening the glottis and releasing a single 'puff ' of air . The lateral movement of the vocal folds continues until the natural elasticity of the tissue takes over , and the vocal folds move back to their original , closed position . Then , the cycle begins again . Each cycle produces a single small puff of air ; the sound of the human voice is nothing more than tens or hundreds of these small puffs of air being released every second and filtered by the vocal tract . Let 's further examine the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory . Myo- means muscle ; the vocal folds , after all , are mostly comprised of muscle tissue . The -elastic suffix serves to remind us that the vocal fold is elastic and that we have active control over its elastic properties . Aerodynamic means that the theory deals with the motion of air and other gaseous fluids , and with the forces active on bodies in motion ( such as the vocal folds ) in relation to such fluids .",1
"compare Sabine 's equation with Eyring and Millinton-Sette 's equation ? All of these people worked on models to aid in acoustical design of ampitheatres ( or any space where clearly hearing sound is important ) . The three equations that you listed all take the same general form , and the latter two are subsequent improvements in Sabine 's original work. '' W.C . Sabine carried out a considerable amount of research in this area and arrived at an empirical relationship between the volume of an auditorium , the amount of absorptive material within it and a quantity which he called the Reverberation Time ( RT ) . As defined by Sabine , the RT is the time taken for a continuous sound within a room to decay by 60 dB after being abruptly switched off and is given by : RT = ( 0.161V ) / Awhere V is the volume of the enclosure ( m³ ) and A is the total absorption within the enclosure ( sabine ) . `` `` Several different approaches have been used to derive equations which give values of reverberation time in better agreement with measured results from less reverberant rooms . One of these , the Norris-Eyring formula , assumes an intermittent decay with the arrival of fewer and fewer reflections . This gives the following formula : '' RT = ( 0.161V ) / ( -S ln ( 1-a ) ) '' where S is the total surface area ( m² ) and a becomes the average absorption coefficient . `` `` When the materials of a room have a wide variety of absorption coefficients , the best predictions are obtained by the Millington-Sette equation . This is simply a matter of substituting an effective absorption coefficient ae = -ln ( 1-ai ) into Sabine 's equation to give : '' RT = ( 0.161V ) / ( sum ( -Si ln ( 1-Ai ) ) where Si is the surface area of the ith material , and Ai is its actual absorption coefficient .",1

"Is it posible by using electromagnetic fields to make something invisible ? Well an experiment about this has been done before.. but I would like to know how does it actually work ...

Light is itself an electromagnetic field that is carrying energy through space -- commonly called an electromagnetic wave or 'light ' . It is this wave that really makes things visible.Conversely , if you have no electromagnetic wave or one of an invisible wavelength , ( at least to the human eye ) then it wo n't bounce off of the object or if it does it wo n't be visible when it reaches you.The visible properties of an object are determined by how EM waves interact with the electrons near the surface of an object . These interactions are what make shiny things shiny ( for instance ) .",1

"box and whisker plots ? how do you pick out the numbers to use with a box and whisker plot when you have all the quartiles , and smallest and largest numbers ? A box-and-whisker plot can be useful for handling many data values . They allow people to explore data and to draw informal conclusions when two or more variables are present . It shows only certain statistics rather than all the data . Five-number summary is another name for the visual representations of the box-and-whisker plot . The five-number summary consists of the median , the quartiles , and the smallest and greatest values in the distribution . Immediate visuals of a box-and-whisker plot are the center , the spread , and the overall range of distribution . The first step in constructing a box-and-whisker plot is to first find the median , thelower quartile and the upper quartile of a given set of data . Example : The following set of numbers are the amount of marbles fifteen different boys own ( they are arranged from least to greatest ) .18 27 34 52 54 59 61 68 78 82 85 87 91 93 100 First find the median . The median is the value exactly in the middle of an ordered set of numbers . *68 is the medianNext , we consider only the values to the left of the median : 18 27 34 52 54 59 61 . We now find the median of this set of numbers . Remember , the median is the value exactly in the middle oa an ordered set of numbers . Thus 52 is the median of the scores less than the median of all scores , and therefore is the lower quartile.52 is the lower quartileNow consider only the values to the right of the median : 78 82 85 87 91 93 100 . We now find the median of this set of numbers . The median 87 is therefore called the upper quartile . 87 is the upper quartile ( *If you 're finding the median in an ordered set with an even number of values , you must take the average of the two middle numbers . For example : 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 . Add the two middle numbers . 5 + 7 = 12 . Divided 12 by 2 to get the average . 12 / 2 = 6 . Therefore 6 is the median for the ordered set of 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 . ) You are now ready to find the interquartile range ( IQR ) . The interquartile range is the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile . In our case the IQR = 87 - 52 = 35 . The IQR is a very useful measurement . It is useful because it is less influenced by extreme values , it limits the range to the middle 50 % of the values.35 is the interquartile rangeplease review these pages .",1

"IS the freezing of water exothermic ? The guy above me does n't know what he 's talking about . He 's confused . Think about it : to freeze water , you need to take energy away from the water , right ? ( You lower the temperature , which is the same thing as taking energy away . Imagine sucking energy away from water to make it freeze . ) So , by definition , freezing water is exothermic . It gives off energy . Conversely , the melting of water is endothermic ; you need to give ice energy in order for it to melt . I know it can get confusing because when you touch ice , it 's cold , so you might think that freezing is endothermic , but it 's not . If you think about it , ice in your hand is taking away energy from your hand in order for it to melt ( that 's why it feels cold ) , so melting is endothermic , making freezing exothermic .",1

"What exactly do stem cells do ? I 've come across a product that claims to promote the release of adult stem cells : what would be the benefit of that ? Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can , under the right conditions , turn into any other kind of cell . They are of particular interest to scientists in that they may provide a means to replace damaged cells that the body can not naturally replaced ( in the spinal chord , for example ) . Stem cells are often talked about ( not inacurately ) in the context of curing numerous degenerative neurological conditions ( Parkinsons , Altzeimers , ALS , etc . ) as well as other conditions that can be traced to the malfunction of a particular type of cell ( they could be used , for example , to replace insuline-sectreteing cells in type I diabetes ) .Although I have not heard of a product like the one you mentioned , I would be inclined to say it does absolutely nothing . Stem cells are only useful if they can be made to differentiate and become a specific type the specific type of cell that is needed , where that type of cell is needed . Flooding the body with stem cells will not make that happen . My best guess is that it is an attempt to profit off the wide-spread association of the term `` stem cell '' with curing uncurable diseases and , by extention , with improved health in general .",1
"According to news sites , the Earth 's rotation slows only 2 milliseconds each 100 years . So why the heck are ... so why the heck have we added like over 21 leap seconds in the past 30 years ? ? ? ! ! ! ! Something is not right . If the Earth only slows 2 milliseconds each hundred years , why not just add 2 milliseconds to the clock each century ? ! ! ! nothing to do with daylight savings . Daylight savings is a human invention , not a natural phenomenon ... .because leap seconds are not being added to compensate for the Earth 's rotation slowing down.The amount of time it takes for the earth to revolve around the sun is 365.2425 days.Even that is an approximation , the decimal digits can keep going on.So initially , the calendar was divided evenly in 365 days . But about every 4 years , you 'd be off 1 day . A century later , you 've drifted off by a whole month ! So , leap years came into effect . Febuary has another day every 4 years . But now you 've approximated a year to 365.25 days , when in reality , its 365.2425 days.Every century , you 'll be off 1 day.So that 's where the next rule comes into play : `` If the year is divisible by 4 , but not by 100 , its a leap year . `` Now we 've approximated it to 365.2425 , but because its always going to be an approximation , our calendar days are always slipping . All because the earth does n't take exactly 365 days to go around the sun.This is why leap seconds are added , and not to account for the slowdown of the earth 's rotation.As to why days are divided in exactly 24 hours , I 'm not sure . But I would think the time difference is WAY less than 20 minutes , or we 'd notice that soon enough , its dark at noon ! : ) Time was divided a long time ago , and a simple system was sought for keeping track of it , so the minuts/hour/year thing is a nice division thats easy to do math with . The lost time , if its accounted for by leap years and such , could be easier to manage.First , I never said the earth is not slowing down . I said its not why leap seconds exist .

But look , your link brings me to a christian science evanglism site , where is the evidence that my answer is incorrect ? You have n't bothered to explain his original question .

"Can diffusion take place in solids ? Yes.Orthoclase feldspar is an example . At high temperatures , Fe will fit into the orthoclase lattice . As temperature drops , the lattice shrinks so that Fe no longer fits . Fe diffuses out of the latice and accumulates along the planes between orthoclase crystal twins . Along the way , it grabs O to produce Fe2O3 . If you look closely at pink granite , usually you will see that the pink grains are actually white and red striped . Those grains are orthoclase crystals with exsolved hematite along twin planes.Exsolution and diffusion of Fe from orthoclase can only occur at high temperature . If the orthoclase cools too quickly for the Fe to diffuse out , it will remain in the orthoclase lattice , which will be distorted to accomodate the larger ( larger than K ) Fe ion.Material science is not boring .",1

When the temperature outside ( that will affect the inside body temperature ) is changed , it changed the whole things that happened in our body , such as hormones , blood pressure , and especially , the lifosit ( the body 's defense `` army '' ) . Sure , if the lifosit ca n't work well , so does the entire body 's defense system . But why microbes still can live at its best ? Simple , because the microbes ' temperature tolerance is higher ( or `` cooler '' ) than our body.So in short , when our body is in cold , it 's just like a snow hurricane winter to our body 's defense system , but still a summer springtime for the microbes . When the microbes spread over the body , it then attacks the part of the body that it loves , such as the brain ( so that it makes you dizzy ) , the defense system ( and the body reacted with rising your body temperature to reactivate the lifosit ) , and the sponge organ within our neck ( that 's their fave place ) . That 's the reason why if you get cold , wearing a syal or drinking hot tea makes better .",1

"How 's apoptosis related to the development of the fingers ? the way apoptosis make the fingers form ( scroll to `` > > > > > > '' ) For every cell , there is a time to live and a time to die . There are two ways in which cells die : They are killed by injurious agents . They are induced to commit suicide.Death by injuryCells that are damaged by injury , such as by mechanical damage exposure to toxic chemicalsundergo a characteristic series of changes : They ( and their organelles like mitochondria ) swell ( because the ability of the plasma membrane to control the passage of ions and water is disrupted ) . The cell contents leak out , leading to inflammation of surrounding tissues.Death by suicideCells that are induced to commit suicide : shrink ; develop bubble-like blebs on their surface ; have the chromatin ( DNA and protein ) in their nucleus degraded ; have their mitochondria break down with the release of cytochrome c ; break into small , membrane-wrapped , fragments . The phospholipid phosphatidylserine , which is normally hidden within the plasma membrane , is exposed on the surface . This is bound by receptors on phagocytic cells like macrophages and dendritic cells which then engulf the cell fragments . The phagocytic cells secrete cytokines that inhibit inflammation ( e.g. , IL-10 and TGF-β ) The pattern of events in death by suicide is so orderly that the process is often called programmed cell death or PCD . The cellular machinery of programmed cell death turns out to be as intrinsic to the cell as , say , mitosis . Programmed cell death is also called apoptosis.1 . Programmed cell death is as needed for proper development as mitosis is . Examples : The resorption of the tadpole tail at the time of its metamorphosis into a frog occurs by apoptosis . > > > > > > > > The formation of the fingers and toes of the fetus requires the removal , by apoptosis , of the tissue between them . The sloughing off of the inner lining of the uterus ( the endometrium ) at the start of menstruation occurs by apoptosis . The formation of the proper connections ( synapses ) between neurons in the brain requires that surplus cells be eliminated by apoptosis",1

"does size affect how fast a ball rolls ? i need it for a science project ? If you have two balls that are different sizes , say one is 2m in diameter and one is 5m in diameter , and both are traveling at 10m/s , they will travel at the same speed , but the smaller ball will have a greater number of revolutions per second than the larger ball . So , no , it does not affect speed , but it does affect revolutions per minute or rpm 's .",1
"Why does the days in the Georgian Calendar differ with the dates every year ? ? The traditional Chinese one isnt The traditional Chinese calendar does not contain “ weeks ” . In ancient China government officials enjoyed a day off for every ten days . The week system was introduced into China , I guess , only in early last century along with the Gregorian calendar . According to the Chinese calendar , a year has 12 months and a month has 29 or 30 days . If a month has 29 days , we call it the lesser month ; if 30 days – the greater month . Each of the 12 months of a certain year can be lesser or greater , depending on the astronomical calculation . There is no special name to each month ; they are identified by the ordinal numbers ( 1 to 12 ) . If you want to know , for example , whether the second month of the next Chinese year ( or lunar year ) is a lesser or greater one , you have to consult an almanac or a perpetual calendar . There is an intercalary month arranged for every three years ( approximately ) . An intercalary year has 13 months . That ’ s the outline of the Chinese calendar . And it may be obvious that the Chinese calendar can not match its dates to the week 's days .",1

"Which comes first : thunder or lightning ? Look , lightning and thunder HAPPEN at the same time . Lightning causes the air to displace and when it contracts again ( immediately ) you get thunder , the sound of air filling a gap . You see lightning first because it is traveling @ 180,000 mps , thunder travels at the speed of sound ( depends on where you live ) . You can generally determine how far away you are from the place of origin by counting 1 one-hundred , 2 one hundred , etc until you hear thunder and divide that number by two . That is how many miles away you are.BTW , if you see lightning and hear thunder at the same time , the event is right where you are !",1

Anytime you have a problem that is continuous , as opposed to discrete , you will need to use either integration or differentiation to characterize the solution . That means to say that every problem that involves time in one way or another will necessitate the use of calculus to find an answer at some instant in time . If the problem is such that you can approximate the answer , then you can discretize the parameters as small slices of time and come up with an approximate answer - without using calculus .",1
How come the Cro Magnons ; the ancestors of Homo Sapiens had larger cranial capacities than us ? I have read that they were more intelligent then us.Why is this exception in the evolutionary trends ? Probably they had taken a lot more meat than us . Eating meat does grow your brain . Predators do have bigger brains than preys.Their brains are bigger because of the need to calculate the risk and to overtake the preys . Cro Magnons had bigger cranial capacities could have been because they desperately need food especially meat to survive the weather . Their physiques had to adapt the condition and made them tacticians.Cro Magnons maybe were smarter than us in surviving the harsh condition of the world bare-handed but I think that they they were no smarter than us in using tools or making great tools . It 's like native humans or jungle people or whoever who lives in the wilderness who can bear harsh environment bare-handed compared to us living in cities with great facilities but lack experience in handling harsh conditions bare-handed .,1

"Are Space and Time continuous or are them quantized ? There are two major theories of modern physics : Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity . Both work well , with QM being applicable to atomic and smaller sizes , and GR to large ( Solar size , galaxy size , etc . ) things.The major question in physics today is : how do we combine QM and GR so that they are two aspects of one larger theory . This postulated theory is usually called a Unified Theory or Theory of Everything or something like that . String theories are attempts to do this ( so far all are still incomplete ) .The major difference between QM and GR is that nn QM energy comes in discrete levels ( all way to small for us to notice ) . However in GR space-time is continious . So it is not instantly clear whether space-time is continous or quantized in a unified theory.For consistency between these space quantization would have to be on extremely small scales . This would almost certain occur ( if it did ) at distances called the Planck length , which is ~ 10^-33 cm . ( This is about one billion trillion times smaller than an atomic nucleus . ) Quantization of time would then be the interval for light to cross this distance , about 10^-43 seconds . It is because of a lack of a unified theory that physicists ca n't say anything about the conditions of the universe before 10^-43 seconds after the Big Bang . ( Of course that is still pretty good . ) The short answer is : no one knows , but the scale of quantization would have to be much , much smaller than any known elementary particle .",1

You can see this in real life : A candle flame is yellow , but a blowtorch , which is much hotter , is blue.Color also gives astronomers an indication of how old the star is : Stars cool down as they age , so a red star would be very old and on its way to dyinng ( Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star , on its way out ) , while white and blue stars are more recently formed",1

"Does debris affect a tornadoes wind speed ? The funnel of a tornado is actually clear . The only way we actually see the tornado is because of the debris that is circulating inside the funnel . The wind speed of the tornado will not increase because of debris . Debris can only be a hinderance to a tornado . To help you think about this , think about a very large piece of debris , lets say a mountain . Now while the mountain is not going to be picked up and tossed around like dirt , cows , trucks and some houses , it is still something that is getting in the way of a tornado . The mid-west experiences far more tornadoes than any other region . This is because they are uninhibited from forming . Basically the more you put in the way of the funnel the more difficult it will be for that funnel ( aka the tornado ) to form . To put it on a level that everyone can relate to , think of your toilet . When you flush the toilet the water starts to swirl . A funnel begins to appear in the water and eventually everything goes away . What happens if there is too much TP ( debris ) in the way ? The funnel never forms and you get a clog .

"How deep can a scuba diver descend before encountering a dangerous level of pressure ? Is there a way this is calculated ? If so , how ? The main dangers a suba diver are subjected to dealing with depth are not just because of pressure , but because of the pressure of Nitrogen or Oxygen in the lungs.Too much nitrogen forced into the blood causes nitrogen narcosis , which is like being drugged by a narcotic . How deep you go depends on how the percentage of nitrogen in your air and how long you are down.Too mush Oxygen forced into the blood is toxic , and can directly cause brain damage or death .

"WAt would reduce the resistance of a metal wire ? Increasing its thickness , temperature , or length ? ? Or would it be all of those 3 ? increasing thickness , decreasing temperature , and decreasing length would all reduce the resistance of a metal wire . so the only thing that reduces it by increasing is thickness.a good way to remember this is just to reason it out . if the wire is thicker , current can move more freely and with less resistance then a thinner , more constricted wire . the electrons in the current would have more space to move around . if you increase temperature , it would cause more resistance , because with temperature , comes heat , and heat just makes more resistance . lower temperatures allow the current to move more freely , which is why superconductors work really well at low temperatures . and length , well the longer the wire is , the more the resistance is going to build up along the whole thing ... the electrons are just encountering more resistance because the wire is longer..",1

Why does the same side of the moon always face us ? Our moon is locked in what is known as a geo-synchronous orbit . For millions of years the angular momentum has stablized the moon to provide very little loss of energy between earth and moon . This does not account for the influences that the moon has upon our oceans though . ( Tides ) Our solar system has `` moved about '' for many millions of years to allow for efficient energy transfers between baryonic masses . This is not unlike a person who sit 's in a chair and move 's about to become more comfortable . Peace,1
"TESTING EMULSION TYPES , I.E . HOW WOULD YOU DETERMINE WHETHER THE EMULSION IS W/O OR O/W ? It is possible to test whether an emulsion is an inverse emulsion or normal emulsion by working out what the continuous phase is .

"Though electron affinity of fluorine is greater than flourine , Flourine acts as a better oxidising agent.Why ? I am assuming you are talking about fluorine and chlorine . But electron affinity deals only with the atoms ability to accept an electron . Oxidation deals with interactions between atoms . Fluorine being smaller has more atoms that are close to the atom being oxidized and thus greater charge density around the atom it 's oxidizing . Electron affinity deals only with electrons and no atoms thus electron repulsion of the smaller fluorine orbitals cause a decrease in electron affinity when compared to the larger atom of chlorine . I am not sure this is correct but it is all I could think of . Good luck .",1

"What is the difference between these terms - Taxonomy , Systematics & Classification ? Are they interchangable ? These are closely related terms that refer to different things . Taxonomy is a biological discipline that studies the theory and practice of classification . It 's more about the rules and techniques used to classify living things.Classification is any grouping of things according to arbitrary categories or attributes . Biological classifications , however , aim at establishing natural groups ( i.e. , groups that reflect the genealogy or descent of the organisms ) .Systematics is sometimes used with the same meaning as taxonomy , but it is a broader concept that comprises the scientific study of the types and diversity of organisms and their interelationships ; other definitions are `` the science of biological classification '' or `` the science of organismal diversity '' .",1
"if its zero degrees and tommorow its going to be twice as cold how cold will it be ? So it depends on whether your question is in Fahrenheit or Centigrade ( aka Celsius ) . If it is in degrees Fahrenheit you need to convert to Rankine , divide by two , and then convert back to Fahrenheit:0 Fahrenheit = 459.67 Rankine ; twice as cold = 229.835 Rankine ; 229.835 Rankine = -229.835 Degrees Fahrenheit which is your answer.If , however , you are for some reason using metric , then you convert Centigrade ( Celsius ) to Kelvin , Divide by two , and convert back to Centigrade.So : 0 Centigrade = 275.15K ; twice as cold = 136.575K , converting back to centigrade you get -136.575 Centigrade which is your answer utilizing metric units .",1
"why are women so mentally differant from men ? why is it that when a man knows that somthing is bothering a woman and he ask her `` whats wrong '' they always say `` nothing '' ... but if the roles are reversed he tells her whats bothering him . The right and left hemispheres of the human brain are connected by a huge nerve bundle called the corpus callosum . In the male fetus when male hormones are generated the corpus callosum shrinks reducing cross-communication . Because the left hemisphere deals with logic and the right hemisphere deals with emotion , women connect all logic better with emotion than men do . Although a man can chose , he is always either logical or emotional but rarely both at the same time . A man either flies off the handle or thinks the problem through . A woman can weep or laugh when she discovers something that makes sense . This explains why women are better at nurturing ( cranky ) children and men are better at hunting for bears ( or a six pack ) . You figure out the rest . I ca n't .",1

"Heavy water what is the role that heavy water plays in the nuclear explosion process ? Heavy water is like regular water except that instead of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom ( H20 ) it has two deuterium atoms and an oxygen atom ( D20 ) . Deuterium is a hydrogen atom with an extra neutron.Water is used in nuclear reactors to moderate the reaction speed , and to absorb heat . Nuclear fission starts by giving off neutrons that create a chain reaction . Any water around it absorbs those neutrons ( becoming heavy water ) and slows the reaction . If heavy water is used instead of regular hydrogen water , the neutrons are not absorbed . This means that less pure nuclear material can be used to sustain a reaction . For example unrefined uranium , which is much less expensive , can be used instead of enriched uranium .",1

"Will road rage occur ? Traveling in a car at the speed of sound , you blow your horn at the car in front of you also traveling at the speed of sound . Will the car in front of you hear the horn ? Will he give you the finger if he does ? The sound will reach the car in front of you . Although it may seem as though it would not , considering that you are already traveling at the speed of sound , therefore you may think the sound waves go as the same speed as your car therefore not traveling any faster than you are and not getting to the car in front of you . However , this is not the case . This can be explained using Einstein 's theory of relativity . Einstein describes `` frames of reference '' and in your frame of reference , you are not moving ; everything else is moving . Everything in your car is stationary relative to everything else , this is why you do n't feel like you 're moving , and if you throw a book sideways , it does n't fly backwards with the speed your vehicle is moving , this is because the car , yourself , and the book are all moving with the same speed your car is moving . They are all stationary relative to each other . When the sound waves are created , they move in all directions at the speed of sound ( 331 m/s ) , so in your frame of reference , they would be moving at 331 m/s away from the car in all directions . This means from the frame of reference of a person standing outside of your car , the sound waves would actually appear to be moving at twice the speed of sound . This is just like if you threw a ball forward out from the car at 15 m/s , it would appear to an outsider to be moving at that speed plus the speed of sound ( well in a vacuum anyway , or before air resistance took over ) To use a better example of these frames of reference , you know that the earth is rotating . It is rotating at 1070 mi/hr at the equator , yet it seems not to be moving at all , it is our frame of reference when we are standing 'still . ' the speed of sound is no different traveling in different directions on the earth because of this rotation.and yes , he would probably give you the finger . I mean , he is going at the speed of sound , how impatient are you ?",1
"Could inteligent life have evolved from a different animal group , such as reptiles , birds or even insects ? Does higher intelligence ( such as humans have ) require some quality that only mammals have ? The fact that female mammals produce milk for their young means that at birth a mammal can have a relatively large brain , although they are relatively helpless . Other animals have to be able to at least get around.Brains do n't grow as much as other parts of the body , which is why babies seem to have large heads.The obvious counter-example is birds , where the young are stuck in the nest and depend on their parents for food . However , flight puts a limit on how heavy a bird can be , and so how heavy its brain can be . But flightless birds are a possible candidate.Amphibians and reptiles are cold-blooded , which seems as though it would rule out our sort of intelligence . On the other hand , perhaps an intelligent crocodile would think of slowing down when the temperature drops much as we think of sleep . Remember that a large brain would mean a large egg ( and you have to fit the rest of the body inside the egg as well ) .",1

"How is Iron ore mined ? Modern mines , in Minnesota and Michigan in the US , and Eastern Canada mine taconite . Taconite is a term to describe magnetite ore that is very hard and fine-grained . Taconite must be first processed into iron oxide pellets by crushing and magnetic separation of the magnetite to concentrate the iron to about 66 % before it can be used in steel-making.Taconite mining involves moving tremendous amounts of ore and waste . The waste comes in two forms , bedrock in the mine ( mullock ) that is n't ore , and unwanted minerals which are an intrinsic part of the ore rock itself ( gangue ) . The mullock is mined and piled in waste dumps , and the gangue is separated during the beneficiation process and is removed as tailings . Taconite tailings are mostly the mineral quartz , which is chemically inert . This material is stored in large , regulated water settling ponds.In Australia iron ore is won from three main sources ; massive magnetite ore as at Savage River , Tasmania ; pisolite `` channel-iron '' ore derived by mechanical erosion of primary banded-iron formations and accumulated in alluvial channels such at Robe River , Western Australia ; and banded iron formation related ores such as at Newman , Hamersley and Koolyanobbing , Western Australia . Other types of ore are coming to the fore recently , such as oxidised ferruginous hardcaps , for instance iron ore deposits near Argyle , Western Australia.World production averages one billion metric tons of raw ore annually . The world 's largest producer of iron ore is the Brazilian mining corporation CVRD , followed by Australian companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto Group . China is currently the largest consumer of iron ore , which translates to be the world 's largest steel producing country . Iron ore is common worldwide , but commercial mining operations are dominated by the countries listed below : Estimated iron ore production in million tons for 2004 , according to U.S. Geological Survey [ 2 ] China 280 Australia 220 Brazil 220 India 110 Russia 95 United States 54 Ukraine 66 South Africa 40 Canada 31 Sweden 22 Venezuela 18 Kazakhstan 17 Iran 16 Mauritania 10 Mexico 12 Other countries 40 Total world 1250 [ edit ] RefiningPure elemental iron is virtually unknown on the surface of the Earth except as wüstite from meteorites and very rare forms of deep mantle xenoliths . Therefore , all sources of iron used by human industry exploit iron oxide minerals , the primary form which is used in industry being hematite.However , in some situations , more inferior iron ore sources have been used by industrialised societies when access to high-grade hematite ore was not available . This has included utilisation of taconite in the United State , particularly during World War II , and goethite or bog ore used during the Revolutionary war and the Napoleonic wars . Magnetite is often used because it is magnetic and hence easily liberated from the gangue minerals.Inferior sources of iron ore generally required beneficiation . Due to the high density of hematite relative to silicates , beneficiation usually involves a combination of crushing and milling as well as heavy liquid separation . This is achieved by passing the finely crushed ore over a bath of solution containing bentonite or other agent which increases the density of the solution . When the density of the solution is properly calibrated , the hematite will sink and the silicate mineral fragments will float and can be removed.Magnetite is beneficiated by crushing and then separating the magnetite from the gangue minerals with a magnet . This is usually so efficient that lower grade ore can be treated when it is magnetite than a comparable grade of hematite ore , especially when the magnetite is quite coarse.To convert an oxide of iron to metallic iron it must be smelted .",1

I think not so , since increasing the pressure constantly would also raise his internal pressure . But the question is , HOW much pressure ?

"Do men and women see things differently ? The short answer is 'yes ' unless you are referring to sight.The right and left hemispheres of the human brain are connected by a huge nerve bundle called the corpus callosum . In the male fetus when male hormones are generated the corpus callosum shrinks reducing cross-communication . Because the left hemisphere deals with logic and the right hemisphere deals with emotion , women connect all logic better with emotion than men do . Although a man can chose , he is always either logical or emotional but rarely both at the same time . A man either flies off the handle or thinks the problem through . A woman can weep or laugh when she discovers something that makes sense . This explains why women are better at nurturing ( cranky ) children and men are better at hunting for bears ( or a six pack ) . Of course men can care for their children and women can hunt bare ; I mean bear .",1

"What are the pros and cons of Nuclear thermal propulsion ? Is it feasible to use it in a manned mission to moon ? How is it better than nuclear electric propulsion ? What will be its harmful effects ? Will it violate the NTBT ? Project Orion was an idea in the 1960s to use nuclear explosions to push a space ship around the solar system . The idea was to use a lot of small explosions in succession to create the sort of effect one gets with a continious burn from the usual chemical fueled rockets.There were some small scale tests done with non-nuclear nukes , which suggested the concept was n't crazy , but there was never any full scale tests , and certainly nothing using fission bombs.It is not clear that scaling this concept up to the size needed for a manned rocket would be that feasible , although some disagree with that assesment . There would be a tremendous stress on the vehicle from all these explosions , especially if they were more contained ( in order to harness more of the explosive power for thrust ) .But , I do n't think we 'll ever see anything like this unless there is some sort of mass evacuation of the planet . ( Not there is anywhere to go . ) As you might expect , a Project Orion rocket is essentially the same as a huge number of atmospheric atomic explosions . Not exactly enviro-friendly , to say the least.IF by `` nuclear thermal '' propulsion you mean the generators used by some space probes to generate electricity , then these are far to weak for a manned vehicle . They could n't supply the power to lift off from Earth , and a trip to the moon using an electric ion drive takes much , much longer than the more direct chemically driven Apollo trajectory . Ion propulsion has tried on the space probe Deep Space 1 , although this was not nuclear powered .",1
"What are eyebrows for ? from straigtdope.com : '' The consensus is that eyebrows keep moisture ( sweat , mostly , but also rain ) from running down one 's forehead and straight into the eyes .

There have been one or two comments from people who were , for one reason or another , temporarily without eyebrows who claimed the difference was noticeable . I 've always been content with that explanation .

A return to pre-1980 total column ozone amounts in the Antarctic is expected by the middle of this century . `` so , in other words , we only have to keep doing the right thing and not using the chemicals which we know deplete the ozone , and the earth will heal itself by 2050. cool eh !",1
"Why does like charges repel each other ? This is a very good question . Ultimately it comes down to being one of the fundamental features of our universe . But it can also be broken down a bit.Like charges repel , and opposite ones attract because of differences in their electric fields . But the electric fields are really part of the larger electromagnetic force . This force is mediated by photons ( light ) and , indeed light is a self-propagating electromagnetic wave.But there are also three other fundamental forces : gravity , the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force . The strong nuclear force is well , strong , but very short range . It holds the protons and neutrons together in a nucleus ( otherwise the like charges from the protons would break up every nucleus except hydrogen ) . The weak nuclear force is sort of a miscellaneous , and comes into play in certain radioactive decay sequences.In the 1980s it was shown that the electromagnetic and weak forces are actually the same thing . The difference we observe is that the universe is , relatively speaking , `` cold , '' and these two parts have separated out . It is sort of like having a glass of steam ( one thing ) which cools down until there is water and ice ( two things ) . The water and ice look a lot different from each other , but are fundamentally the same . In the same way in the very , very early universe when things were a lot hotter , the electromagnetic and weak forces were identical - like the steam in the analogy.More recently it was found that the strong force can also be linked to the `` electroweak '' force in the same sort of manner . The mathematical and physical details are different from `` electroweak unification '' but the basic principle is the same . It was from this Grand Unification of the electromagnetic , weak , and strong forces the the theoretical notion of quarks came . This GUT has been tested and the experiments show it is right on target.The next step is to connect the electro-weak-strong force with gravity . This is a lot harder because the first three are understood in the context of Quantum Mechanics and gravity is understood with General Relativity . QM and GR are not compatible on some basic principles.One approach that is being tried to combine QM and GR is with string theory . To make this work the universe is composed of 11 dimensions , the usual 3-spatial and 1-temporal dimentsion , plus 7 very , very small spatial dimensions . If these extra 7 are looped around themselves so that they are vastly `` smaller '' than a proton , we 'd never really notice them.What string theory seems to suggest is that there are just some ways to make stuff in the universe , and one of these ways is to create the `` force particles '' that mediate the fundamental forces.So , extrapolating that , and realizing that string theory is in no sense proven , we can say that `` like charges repel '' because of the geometry ( the 11-dimensions ) of the universe.But string theory remains far from being complete mathematically , and no one can really make solid predictions yet to test it . So , you can also fall back on the answer in the first paragraph .",1

"why is the sky blue ? Space is black and the sun is like yellowish-orangish , so why blue , or sometimes gray The sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering . This effect was actually first observed and described by John Tyndall , and a only few years later was explored in more detail by Lord Rayleigh.Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of light by particles . In the case of the sky , these particles are the molecules of air , themselves , and not dust or water vapor as is often proferred . The scattering depends on the wavelength of the light . Light towards the violet end of the spectrum scatters more than light at the red end . Sunlight is scattered throughout the sky and causes it to appear blue to an observer on the ground . The reason the sky does n't appear violet to us has to do with the sensetivity of the cones in the human eye.Just as the blue light gets scattered , red light from the sun travels farther , which is why the sun appears yellowish-orangish . In space the sun appears noticeably more blue . Space is black because there are almost no particles to scatter light .",1

"Help Me Please ! Algebra no understand ! ? How do you find the slope of an linear equation your help would be great ! The slope , as it was taught to me simply long ago is just this : `` The rise over the run . '' What this means is the distance of the 'y ' coordinate , divided by the distance of the 'x ' coordinate.To give an example that 's a little more easy to grasp , consider walking up a flight of stairs . Measure the distance from the bottom floor to the floor at the top of the stairs , that height is your 'rise ' . Now , measure the distance between the first stair on the flight and the last stair that was climbed horizontally , and that is your 'run'.Once you have those two measurements , you can calculate the slope by dividing the height of the floor above by the length taken up by the stairs to get there . Draw the stairs as a right triangle.The right side is the rise , the bottom is the run , and the 'hypotenuse ' is the square root of the sum of both . The 'slope ' , is the right side divided by the bottom .",1

"How do we use the matter waves of the electrons in an electron microscope ? Teacher said electrons are waves ( DeBrolie ) and we computed wavelength of an electron moving fast . He said electron microscope use electron waves to see tiny things . I asked if the matter waves were electromagnetic . He said no they are matter waves . I asked if they are not electromagnetic how can we observe them in a microscope . He said ... he did not know . Could you please help me ? An electron microscope bounces electrons off of things , captures them as they bounce off and then resolves a picture from the distribution of electrons that have returned . This is the same way a light bounces off stuff and we capture the reflected photons to make a picture with our eye . We cant see electrons with our eyes , though , so we need a machine to collect the scattered electrons and a computer to put an image together based on how the electrons scattered . The reason electrons can be used to see smaller things is that they have a `` shorter wavelength '' than visible light . The debroglie wavelength is n't a complete description of the wave properties of an electron or pohoton , but it is a good way to approximate many things . The wave function that describes an electron or a photon , or anything else is NOT a `` matter '' wave . That is a poor description . The wave itself is related to the probability that you will find the electron at a certain point in space , or with a certain property like velocity or spin . Your teacher is correct in saying that the electron is a wave , this wave can tell you the probability of measurements coming out a certain way , but the electron does not have characteristics like position or velocity UNTIL you measure them . Back to your question . As you know the debrolie shortens when momentum goes up . A shorter debrolie wavelength means that the electron is generally more localized than photons , which have relatively small momementums . If you want to bounce particles ( electrons of photons ) off say , two atoms separated by 1nm , the particle your sending toward it needs to be localized enough ( have a short enough wavelength ) so that it hits only one , and not both of them . A green photon would come waving in , hit both , and as it came back , the wave would be spread out so much that you could find it anywhere , and you couldnt make a picture of the two atoms no matter how many photons you bounced off of them . If you use electrons though , their wave function could be localized to bounce of only one or the other and based on where you measured it when it returned , you could use the information to resolve an image of the two atoms . This same idea is why you cant ( I 'm pretty sure ) resolve the image of the lunar landar on the moon with visible light . By the time the photons get back here from the moon , their wave functions have spread out to cover too large an area , and we cant tell exactly where they came from , resulting in a fuzzy , non-detailed image .",1

I wo n't show that step . First , let 's find out how much heat it 'll take to get the ice from -17.87 degrees to zero degrees , where it has to be in order to melt . This is a change of 17.87 degrees . ( Because one degree Celsius and one Kelvin is the same size degree , they are interchangable . ) We 'll use the specific heat capacity of ice . 59.90 g ice * ( 2.1 J/g*K ) * ( 17.87 K ) =2248 J = 2.248 kJNext , let 's find out how much energy it would take to melt that ice at 0 degrees to water at 0 degrees using the heat of fusion:59.90 g ice * ( 333 J/g ) =19950 J = 19.95 kJNext , let 's find out how much energy it would take to get the water from 0 to 100 degrees ( so it can become steam ) using the specific heat of water:59.90 g water * ( 4.2 J/g*K ) * ( 100 .

"Do Photons have any mass ? ( explain ) ? if yes , so why the Photon 's mass does n't increase while moving in the speed of light.and if no , so why a Photon hits an electron , the electron starts moving and the lights frequence increases ? ? ? It is not possible to experimentally measure something to have a value of exactly zero . The current limit on the mass of the photon is < 10^25 times lighter than the proton.The idea of a particle 's mass changing with velocity has not been used by serious physicists for several decades . We now rewrite the momentum equation asmomentum = gamma*mass*velocity , where the factor gamma describes the effect previously known as `` relativistic mass '' .The energy of a particle is energy = gamma * mass * c^2 ( try setting gamma=1 for a stationary particle ) so we can write momentum = energy * velocity / c^2or momentum = energy/c for particles moving at the speed of light.So , even though a photon has zero ( or very small ) mass , it still has momentum , which it can transfer to an electron .",1

"how are ionic solids formed ? Ionic solids are indeed formed by a gain and loss of electrons . More specifically , they are formed by a chemical reaction between a metal atom and a nonmetal atom . For example , sodium , a metal , has a tendency to want to lose an electron , and bromine , a nonmetal , wants to gain an electron , so the sodium gives an electron to bromin ( which is now called bromide ) . Now sodium has lost an electron , which is negatively charged , so it has a net charge of 1+ . Bromine has gained an electron , so it has a net charge of -1 . Since they are oppositely charged , they are attracted to each other ( kind of like how opposite poles of magnets are atracted to each other ) , they ionically bond and become an ionic solid ( also known as a salt ) .",1

"Where can I find an inexpensive but accurate hygrometer ? I want to be able to calibrate it and I need to spend under $ 50 . Nice question , most people unless they are weather buffs or cigar afficianados do n't know about hygrometers.Hygrometers measure relative humidity , or how damp or dry the air is.There are digital and analog hygrometers.Calibration ( adjusting for accuracy ) of both is difficult for various reasons . To calibrate a hygrometer means you need an accurate reference which provides accurate relative humidities over a range of air temperatures and pressures . It is not enough to calibrate a hygrometer at just one point . Most analog ( dial ) hygrometers only allow you to set one point by twiddling the fixed dial until the needle is pointing to the current moisture level.Most inexpensive digital hygrometers do not have calibration controls . The next price level up only allow you to set offset and scale - this is so-called `` linear calibration '' and it is not much better really.Depending on what you are measuring , one of the easiest ways to make your own accurate hygrometer is with two accurate but inexpensive lab thermometers .

"What 's the velocity of an electron around the atom nucleus ? I have a partial answer for you . In Hydrogen , the electron can be thought of as having a velocity of c/137 ( the speed of light times the fine structure constant ) . So it 's barely relativistic.Remember that thinking of the electron as a point particle moving around a nucleus , like a planet in orbit , is not realistic.In larger ( higher Z ) atoms , the electrons closest to the nucleus will have much higher `` velocities '' ( getting closer to c ) .",1
"A New Binary Star system ? I remember reading something years ago about the mass of Jupiter being so large , that if the other planet were somehow pushed into it , that it would begin thermonuclear fusion and become a new star . Any truth to this ? Any references ? Nuclear fusion is result of massive gravitational pull which is possible only in very large masses . It can be true that if mass of Jupitor or any other planet is merged with another very huge mass to reach to required strength it may start fusion , subject it has hydrogen . The reference of Jupitor for that matter is usually to help visuallize the size of the planet .",1

"where is euthanasia legalized ? authanasia is legalized in Australia Belgium The Netherlands Oregon ( United States ) However , there are two types of euthanasia - active and passive . 1 . Active Euthanasia : a positive action is taken to bring about someone ’ s death e.g . the administering of a deadly injection or the assisting in preparations for a suicide2 . Passive Euthanasia involves a refusal to intervene to change the course of events , where the result is the death of the person.All of these countries support Assisted Euthanasia -a second party ( usually a physician ) participates in bringing about the patient ’ s death , but is not the sole cause of the death . Netherland for example allows permits physician assisted dying when each of the following conditions is fulfilled : the patient 's suffering is unbearable with no prospect of improvement the patient 's request for euthanasia must be voluntary and persist over time ( The request can not be granded when under the influence of others , psychological illness or drugs ) the patient must be fully aware of his/her condition , prospects and options there must be consultation with at least one other independent docter who needs to confirm the conditions mentioned above the death must be carried out in a medically appropriate fashion by the doctor or patient , in which case the doctor must be present . the patient is at least 12 years old ( patients between 12 and 16 years of age require the consent of their parents ) these laws are different in each of these countries .",1

"pls give at least thing that the sun can do to all living things . and what is the importance of sunlight ? The sun provides energy to living organisms of the Earth .

Low rung food chain heterotrophs eat autotrophs ( these are herbivores ) and get their calories ( food is a source of chemical potential energy ) from the glucose ( and some other chemicals ) made by autotrophs . Higher level heterotrophs eat the lower level heterotrophs , getting their calories from proteins and fats of the herbivores they are eating . The calories contained in the proteins and fats of the herbivores is derived from the calories of the autotrophs . In essence , the calories from food on this planet are derived from energy from sunlight that plants have converted to chemical form .",1

"Although we see with two eyes a given object we see only one image.Why not two ? Although we see with two eyes , each of which creates its own , slightly different image , we normally have single vision , meaning we see only one image of an object . This is because your brain can normally control the muscles that move each eye carefully so that both are pointing accurately at the object you are looking at . When each eye produces its own image , your brain then joins them together into one . This gives us what is called ‘ single binocular vision ’ .Double vision can be an effect that you can create yourself . For example , if you hold your finger in front of your eyes and then look past it into the distance , you will experience double vision . This is normal .",1
"If I use a mixture of a ten per cent of alcohol and a ninety per gasoline , does the octane increase its level ? Short answer : yes.Octane levels are based on what is called a `` knock resistance . '' When an engine burns gas , the smaller the gas molecules , the quicker it will burn . If it burns too quickly , the energy will be released faster than the piston can use the energy . The excess energy makes the piston rattle in the chamber , `` knocking '' back and forth -- if you 've ever heard a sound like rattling marbles in the engine of an old car climbing a hill , you know what I mean here.Octane is a hydrocarbon with eight carbon atoms ( hence the `` oct '' prefix ) . But gasoline that you get at the pump is not pure octane -- it contains some lighter stuff ( like hexane and septane ) and some heavier stuff ( like novane and decane ) . Plus , there are aspects of whether the molecules in the gas are in straight chains or in branched chains . But when a consumer buys gasoline , they need some sense of what they 're getting to make sure that they 're not getting crap that will burn too quickly and mess up their engine . So instead of trying to make all gas pure octane ( which would be ridiculously expensive and wasteful ) , or trying to give a consumer a detailed assay of the types of hydrocarbons in the gas ( which would be meaningless for the consumer and likewise expensive ) , they formulate the gas into certain knock ratios . The speed of burning is measured against 2,2,4-trimethylpentane ( a type of octane ) and n-pentane . So 87 octane gas knocks as much as a mixture of 13 % pentane and 87 % octane , etc . They compare the knocking effect.Ethanol helps to slow down the burning of the gas , and does work as an actane booster . The follwing link says that 10 % ethanol added to 92 octane will give an octane rating of 94.7 , but warns that ethanol is mildly corrosive to some engine parts .",1

"Why is The ocean salty ? [ be specific ] ? All water , even rain water , contains dissolved chemicals which scientists call `` salts . '' But not all water tastes salty . Water is fresh or salty according to individual judgment , and in making this decision man is more convinced by his sense of taste than by a laboratory test . It is one 's taste buds that accept one water and reject another.A simple experiment illustrates this . Fill three glasses with water from the kitchen faucet . Drink from one and it tastes fresh even though some dissolved salts are naturally present . Add a pinch of table salt to the second , and the water may taste fresh or slightly salty depending on a personal taste threshold and on the amount of salt held in a `` pinch . '' But add a teaspoon of salt to the third and your taste buds vehemently protest that this water is too salty to drink ; this glass of water has about the same salt content as a glass of sea water.Obviously , the ocean , in contrast to the water we use daily , contains unacceptable amounts of dissolved chemicals ; it is too salty for human consumption . HOW SALTY IS THE OCEAN ? ... How salty the ocean is , however , defies ordinary comprehension . Some scientists estimate that the oceans contain as much as 50 quadrillion tons ( 50 million billion tons ) of dissolved solids.If the salt in the sea could be removed and spread evenly over the Earth 's land surface it would form a layer more than 500 feet thick , about the height of a 40-story office building . The saltiness of the ocean is more understandable when compared with the salt content of a fresh-water lake . For example , when 1 cubic foot of sea water evaporates it yields about 2.2 pounds of salt , but 1 cubic foot of fresh water from Lake Michigan contains only one one-hundredth ( 0.01 ) of a pound of salt , or about one sixth of an ounce . Thus , sea water is 220 times saltier than the fresh lake water . What arouses the scientist 's curiosity is not so much why the ocean is salty , but why it is n't fresh like the rivers and streams that empty into it . Further , what is the origin of the sea and of its `` salts '' ? And how does one explain ocean water 's remarkably uniform chemical composition ? To these and related questions , scientists seek answers with full awareness that little about the oceans is understood.Illustration : Sources of salts in the ocean.THE ORIGIN OF THE SEA ... In popular language , `` ocean '' and `` sea '' are used interchangeably . Today 's seas are the North and South Pacific , North and South Atlantic , Indian and Arctic Oceans and the Antarctic waters or seas.Scientists believe that the seas are as much as 500 million years old because animals that lived then occur as fossils in rocks which once were under ancient seas . There are several theories about the origin of the seas , but no single theory explains all aspects of this puzzle . Many earth scientists agree with the hypothesis that both the atmosphere and the oceans have accumulated gradually through geologic time from some process of `` degassing '' of the Earth 's interior . According to this theory , the ocean had its origin from the prolonged escape of water vapor and other gases from the molten igneous rocks of the Earth to the clouds surrounding the cooling Earth . After the Earth 's surface had cooled to a temperature below the boiling point of water , rain began to fall and continued to fall for centuries . As the water drained into the great hollows in the Earth 's surface , the primeval ocean came into existence . The forces of gravity prevented the water from leaving the planet.SOURCES OF THE SALTS ... Sea water has been defined as a weak solution of almost everything . Ocean water is indeed a complex solution of mineral salts and of decayed biologic matter that results from the teeming life in the seas . Most of the ocean 's salts were derived from gradual processes such the breaking up of the cooled igneous rocks of the Earth & # 39",1
"What is the temperature of an absolute vacuum ? No one can give me a good answer to this . i never really thought about it and so i was just going to say that temperature doesnt matter because its a vacuum and is dealing with the pressure ... but when i thought about it ... come to think of it , i do have an answer for you . the temperature would be zero kelvin , absolute zero . in an absolute vacuum , the pressure would be 0 if there were no particles , because the more particles you cram into one place , the more pressure there is because p=F/A pressure equals the force of the particles divided by the area of the wall of the container , so with no force of particles ( since there are no partiles ) , the pressure would be zero . in an absolute vacuum , there are no particles . Now , if the pressure is zero , then according to the formula PV=nRT ( which is just the ideal gas law formula , ) if P ( pressure ) equals 0 , i think that means that T ( temperature in Kelvin ) would also be 0 which would mean that the temperature would be at absolute zero ( which is defined as the temperature where all matter stops moving.. not that this would make a difference because there are no particles there because it 's an absolute vacuum . This is what i suspect and to confirm my beliefs , it is consistent with the fact that someone else said that outer space was 3K , and although it 's very close to an absolute vacuum , there are a few particles and atoms of gas floating around there , and so it is not quite an absolute vacuum , and the temperature is 3K , meaning it 's not quite at absolute zero . so it stands to reason that since temperature decreases when pressure decreases , that in an absolute vacuum the temperature would be absolute zero , 0 kelvin.i hope this is a `` good answer '' and that i made sense while i took you through my reasoning : )",1

"can wood be liquified ? well , it depends on what you mean by `` liquefied '' . most certainly it can be ground or sanded into a fine dust ( sawdust ) and then mixed with water - voila , liquified wood.on the other hand , if you mean melted , the way you melt ice or iron.. not really , no . wood is a pretty complex substance , with lots of different kinds of chemicals arranged into cells . chemically speaking , it 's mostly carbon and water , and trace amounts of a bazillion other chemicals . if you heat it up , some other chemical reactions will happen first ( combustion , for instance , in the presence of oxygen ) . in the absence of oxygen , you make charcoal if you heat wood to around 300C - the water evaporates away , the bonds break and all the other chemicals are driven out . what 's left is a chunk of solid , mostly ( 90 % ) carbon in noncrystalline or `` amorphous '' form . if you KEEP heating it , always without any oxygen because it 'll burn otherwise - eventually this stuff will melt , but solid carbon melts at around 3800C , which is getting pretty close to the temperature of the surface of the sun . so it 's pretty difficult to do , though if you increase the pressure , the melting temperature will go down - this is how they make synthetic diamonds.otherwise , wood can be `` liquefied '' through other chemical processes , such as decomposition/rotting - this is where oil comes from - but by the time it 's liquid , it hardly qualifies as wood anymore.so , i guess the short answer to the question is no , it ca n't be .",1

It ionizes one of the upper sections of the atmosphere , hence called the ionosphere ( mainly oxygen , nitrogen , and hydorgen atoms ) . At the surface level high frequency sun radiation has lost most of its energy , so it can only ionize individual atoms and molecules , which is virtually unnoticable .",1
"how dies gravity really work ? Just to expand on the answer by `` twertyto '' , the answer to your question is `` We do n't know yet '' . This is one of the major questions in physics right now . There are some ideas but none of them have been proven either mathematically or in laboratory experiment . It is believed by most leading minds in physics that once we learn the exact relationship between gravity and the other known forces ( electromagnetic , strong nuclear and weak nuclear ) , we will then understand how gravity works . To understand this relationship will take what is called the `` grand unified theory '' , which is not yet a theory at all but a hoped-for theory to be developed in the near future . The `` grand unified theory '' would explain how gravity is related to mass and energy and the `` known forces '' mentioned above , and would do for gravity what Einstein 's `` E=MC2 '' ( relativity ) did for understanding the relationship between mass and energy . ( Some quick background : E=MC2 explained the exact relationship between mass and energy , showing they are both different aspects of the same thing , and can therefore be converted into each other ) . To sum this up in a simple fashion : scientists believe that gravity , energy , mass and even time are all made of the same `` stuff '' at some super-fundamental level , but they have n't yet figured out this fundamental level . Once someone does ( which would pretty much be a guaranteed Nobel prize ) , we will know how gravity works . Until then , we can only speculate .",1
"Here 's another Geometry brain teaser for you : ? A 6-foot-diameter disk and an 18-foot-diamter disk sit side by side ( or are tangent to each other ) . Determine the shortest length of rope that will go around both disks . here you assume there is almost no point of intersection ... or at least that it is exactly a point therefor no measureable space so you must determine the two circumfrences ... use the equationc=pi * diameterc1 = pi *6c2 = pi * 18total distance is 24pihope that helps ! actually , that is a good point , when i first read it i assumed that we would want to put the rope around the circle ... meaning that we would have the rope touch the circle at all times ... the problem with stating that there is a line from one circle to the other will be slightly inaccurate , the line from the two circles will be different from the horizontal by several degrees , that would be the need for teh trig function . I would say that for this point in the school year for a high school geometry class they probably havnt gotten to trig yet ... hope this helps ! !",1

"Why does milke spoil ? help ! Because after milk is extracted , it is then cooled in the dairy and transported in refrigerated tankers for processing . Unchilled milk would soon go sour due to acid production by lactobacilli . Even if kept refrigerated , raw milk goes off rapidly due to the action of psychrophilic ( cold-tolerant ) bacteria . These produce proteinases and lipases which break down both the protein and the fat in milk , causing rancid and bitter tastes and clotting .

"Why use statistics ? I once heard this nice joke at the opening of a conference about statistics : Two experts in statistics go hunting . The first one shoots to a fox and misses it by 5 inches on the right . In the same moment , the second one shoots to the same fox and misses it by 5 inches on the left . So they exclaim together : `` we got it ! `` .The moral of the story : statistics can help you making an idea of some ( not all ) of the phenomena which involve a large number of subjects ( in fact , the same name of the discipline comes from `` state '' , having been developed in the XVII-th century by Pascal and others in order to handle the administration of the raising modern states ) .It does not tell the truth about any single subject of the `` universe '' it studies.It does not promise any certainty about the answers it gives.Most importantly , as the joke teachs , you can not take your statistical projections as valuable in spite of the objectivity of real facts when they clearly appear under your eyes ! Having said this , it can be a useful tool if it is kept in its range of application.Moreover , it may help hunting get more likely to animals , as the probability that an expert in statistics really get one may be very very low !",1

"information about light ? Light , form of electromagnetic radiation similar to radiant heat , radio waves , and X rays . Light consists of extremely fast oscillations of an electromagnetic field in a particular range of frequencies that can be detected by the human eye . Different colour sensations are produced by light vibrating at different frequencies , ranging from about 4 × 1014 vibrations per second for red light to about 7.5 × 1014 vibrations per second for violet light . The visible spectrum of light is usually defined by its wavelength , ranging from the smallest visible wavelength for violet , about 40 millionths of a centimetre ( 16 millionths of an inch ) , to 75 millionths of a centimetre ( about 30 millionths of an inch ) for red . Higher frequencies , corresponding to shorter wavelengths , comprise ultraviolet radiation , and still higher frequencies are associated with X-rays . Lower frequencies , which are at longer wavelengths , are called infrared radiation , and still lower frequencies are characteristic of radio waves . Most light comes from electrons that vibrate at these high frequencies when heated to a high temperature . The higher the temperature , the greater the frequency of vibration and the bluer the light produced.Light is emitted from a source in straight lines and spreads out over a larger and larger area as it travels ; the light per unit area diminishes as the square of the distance . When light strikes an object , it is either absorbed or reflected ; light reflected from a rough surface is scattered in all directions . Some frequencies are reflected more strongly than others , and this gives objects their characteristic colour . White surfaces scatter light of all wavelengths equally , and black surfaces absorb nearly all light . Image-forming reflection , on the other hand , requires a highly polished surface such as that of a mirror.Defining the nature of light has always been a fundamental problem in physics . The English mathematician and physicist Sir Isaac Newton described light as an emission of particles , and the Dutch astronomer , mathematician , and physicist Christiaan Huygens developed the theory that light travels by a wave motion.It is now believed that these two theories are essentially complementary , and the development of quantum theory has led to the recognition that in some experiments light acts like a series of particles and in other experiments it acts like a wave . In those situations in which it travels in wave motion , the wave vibrates at right angles to the direction of travel ; therefore light can be polarized in two mutually perpendicular planes ( see Optics ) .III VELOCITY The speed of light was first measured in a laboratory experiment by the French physicist Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau , although earlier astronomical observations had yielded approximately the right velocity . By the 1970s the speed of light had been measured very precisely as 299,792,458 m/sec ( 186,282.397 mi/sec ) in a vacuum , and could be used to measure large distances by the time it took for a pulse of light or radio waves to reach a target and return . This is the principle of radar and sonar . Accurate knowledge of the speed and the wavelength of light also permits accurate measurement of length . In fact , in 1983 the metre was redefined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second . The velocity of light in air varies slightly with wavelength , averaging about 3 per cent less than in vacuum ; the speed in water is about 25 per cent less , and in glass , 33 per cent less.Light has an important effect on many chemicals . Sunlight , for example , is used by plants to carry out photosynthesis , and the exposure of certain silver-containing chemicals to light causes them to turn dark in the presence of other chemicals , as is the case in photography .",1

"What is lake-effect snow ? Lake effect snow is also know as a snowsquall . It is produced in the winter when cold winds move across long expanses of warmer lake water , picking up water vapor which freezes and is deposited on the lee shores . This effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic effect of higher elevations on the downwind shores . This uplifting can produce narrow , but very intense bands of precipitation , which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow per hour . The areas affected by lake effect snow are called snowbelts.Cold winds in the winter typically prevail from the west-southwest to the northwest in the North Temperate Zone , producing the most dramatic lake effect snow falls on the northeast to south east shores of the Great Lakes . This lake effect produces a significant difference between the snow fall on the eastern and western shores of the Great Lakes . If the air temperature is not low enough to keep the precipitation frozen , it falls as lake effect rain.To can read a detailed article on Lake Snow Effect , Variables Contributing to Lake Effect Snow and Areas Hit By Lake Effect Snow and much more at the following articles : ( 1 ) http : //www.noaa.gov/questions/question_011602.html ( 2 ) http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_effect_snow ( 3 ) http : //www.usatoday.com/weather/tg/wlakeeff/wlakeeff.htm ( 4 ) http : //www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/ ( 5 ) http : //www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap10/lake_effect_snow.html",1

"Is ice made from a salt/water solution actually colder than just water ice ? If you put both solutions in the kitchen freezer would the salt ice be colder than the water one , or would the salt solution stay liquid ? If you were able to get the salt solution cold enough , it would freeze . However , if you put two ice trays side by side , one filled with water , the other filled with salt water , and chilled them to the point where both froze , the would both be the same temperature . However , once the cold was taken away , the salt solution would melt at a much lower temperature than the water only cubes.What salt does when added to water is decrease the temperature at which water will freeze -- as well as melt . How much the freezing/melting point is lowered depends on how much salt is added . The higher the concentration , the lower the freezing/melting point .",1
"how to concentrate a UV light to a coherent light ? this question does n't make sense ( it 's incoherent HAH ! sorry.. corny joke . ) light from a light bulb is called incoherent light because it 's made up of many different waves . waves as you know have a property called phase , which tells you where along the wave-front you are at a given position and time . incoherent light is a mixture of light waves with random phases.coherent light on the other hand , is used to describe light where all of the waves have the same phase - so the waves peak and trough at exactly the same time and position . coherent light is much more intense than incoherent light because all of the phase fronts add up constructively , and so you end up with a very large amplitude wave.so , if you `` concentrate '' UV light , by using a lens or some other sort of focusing device , it will be more intense than the spread-out light , but it wo n't be coherent . the only way to get coherent light is at the source - for instance , an excimer laser can be tuned to emit in the ultraviolet , and the light will be coherent . there is no ( known ) way to convert incoherent light into coherent light , though that 's not to say it 's impossible - such a thing just has n't been invented .",1

They are responsible for women who live together , as in a dorm , synchronizing their ovulatory cycles . Men emit some at a regular rate , but the importance of this is not understood . At stronger concentrations these pheromones have a musky , even offensive , smell - thus the prevalence of musk-type perfumes trying to mimic the effect .

Do n't say that you will take a tumbler ( somewhat resembles a cone whose conical part is cut and sealed from there . ) and fill it with water and then find the volume of it . well , the formula for the volume of a cone is 1/3 * base * height.the trick to doing this is to find the volume of the large cone , then subtract the volume of the small cone . what 's leftover will be the tumbler-shaped volume . plug in numbers for the height and base for both the large and small cones , and then subtract . voila !",1

"Can infinite be a finite measurement ? There are many concepts of infinity , some poetic , some mathematic . In math its a pretty definite concept , poetically its just mind-boggling large . `` If you remove a part from infinity or add a part to infinity , still what remains is infinity '' . So what happens if you have one infinity , and remove bits of it to create another infinitity separated by a small space ? You 'd probably end up with two infinities , which means the concept has to be finite.So as an amount , its indefinite , but as a concept , especially as a singularity in math , has a definite meaning ( measurement was too confusing ) .For example , in trigonometry tan 90° = ∞ , and arctan ∞ = +/- 90° . So while the actual value of ∞ is unknown , the value itself has meaning .",1

"how many taste buds do we use when we are tasting our food ? The types are SweetSaltySourBitterUmame ( alluded to above . From the Japanese word for `` savory , '' this responds to meaty tastes , ie high protein , and MSG . MSG is a food additive , Monosodium glutamate -- and glutamate if an amino acid , which are the building blocks for protein ) .And if you want the nitty-gritty , the idea behind taste buds are that various cells detect chemicals , and depending on the region of the brain that the cell is wired to , you know the taste . But not all receptors even of a given type are the same in their mechanism.Sweet reception is more than just a detection of -OH groups . There is a family of transmembrane g-protein coupled receptors called the T1Rs . The various tastes are sensed by various cells , differentiated by the type of receptors expressed in the cell.The sense of sweetness is detected by cells that express a combination of the T1R2 and T1R3 receptors . There is a quality about the sugars that trigger the perception of sweetness such that they bind to one of each of these receptors , creating a heterodimer and trigger the cascade that makes the cell fire . The umami sense is triggered likewise by a coupling of the T1R1 and T1R3 receptors . Some cells are known to express either only T1R2 or only T1R3 , and these have a low affinity detection of sugars ( or perhaps there is a yet unrecognized ligand for these cells ) .Sourness is the result of an acidic pH , with pH being the presence of hydronium ions ( H+ ) at a concentration greater than 10^-7 mole fraction . Sour is detected in sour-sensing cells by H+ ion blocking of the K+ channels , slowing K+ efflux and ultimately depolarizing the cell . Saltiness is detected by Na+ entering the Na+ channels and depolarize the cell.Bitterness is mediated by several distinct receptors that bind to various types of alkaline ( often amine ) molecules , in the T2R family . Bitterness is usually associated with potential toxins , so many receptors detect many things .",1

"Most gelogists think that the movement of Earth 's plates is caused by what ? a. gravityb . subductionc . convection currentsd . Earths magnetic fields The best answer from the above choices : Slow moving convection currents within the molten aesthenosphere supply new material to the spreading centers in the earth 's ocean floors and other places . These currents are thought to provide force to cause the motion of the oceanic plates , either directly , or indirectly through the mid ocean ridge building process . Subduction is only one part of the process of plate tectonics , that does provide some driving force by pulling the subducting plate downward . Gravity has a role as well , as without gravity , the mid-ocean ridges would not have the weight to provide force with which to push the plates apart at the spreading centers , and the subducting plates would not have the force to pull plates . The earth 's magnetic field may have the least to do with plate tectonics , possibly no role at all .",1

Have placed the Nicad in the freezer to see if dropping the temperature will allow me to re use the nicad in the system . Please help electronics ar n't my thing NiCads in general electronic applications are typically designed to NOT get hot , since the heat destroys the NiCad battery , can damage electronics and causes lawsuits when users get burned from the hot battery . Some devices like radio-controlled cars are high-drain applications that generate a lot of heat , so the batteries for these devices are designed for their specific use.Batteries get hot when they charge due to the high current going into them . The faster they charge , typically the hotter they get . When the battery discharges during use , the same thing happens , the battery gets hotter as more current is drawn from the battery . Without knowing anything else , my guess is that high current draw from the battery cells is causing them to heat up . This can be due to a defective battery , a battery not designed for the way you are using it or your modification damaged the battery or is otherwise causing excessive current drain.Also , increasing the supply voltage can drive more current through the device , so it may just be that the higher voltage is drawing more current.I ’ m not sure how the device is shutting down , so I can ’ t say why it ’ s doing that . Note that the voltage at which a device stops working is the voltage seen by the device itself . If you remove the battery from the device and measure the voltage , you will get a different voltage than if you measure the voltage at the precise moment the device shuts down . This is especially true for high current drain applications , which appears to be what ’ s happening with your batteries . Placing the NiCad ’ s in the freezer wo n't help . They ’ ll have to warm up to work properly anyway .",1

"who discovered the atom ? Democritus and Leucippus , Greek philosophers in the 5th century BC , presented the first theory of atoms ( see article atomism for more details ) . The Greeks believed that atoms were all made of the same material but had different shapes and sizes , which determined the physical properties of the material . For instance , the atoms of a liquid were thought to be smooth , allowing them to slide over each other . This theory was not founded on experimental evidence.In 1808 , John Dalton proposed that an element is composed of a single , unique type of atoms , and that whilst their shape or structure was immutable , atoms of different elements could combine to form more complex structures ( compounds ) . Through his experiments , Dalton discovered the law of multiple proportions - that is , if two elements form more than one compound between them , then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers .",1

"CAN ANYBODY CLARIFY ? If a person suffered from amnesia and then was cured would they remember that they forgot ? It is hard to say.The underlying cause of amnesia is critical to answer this question.If you are talking a traumatic event to the brain , then the memories could be permanetly lost . The physical structure of the brain could have been damaged beyond repair and the information contained there would be lost.Sometimes , the area is just injured and takes time to heal . In this case , over time the memories would begin to come back as the brain reroutes synapses to accommodate the injury.If it was a psychological amensia , then it may or may not come back depending on how the person can cope with the experience . In this case , there is usually very little physical brain involvment.In general , in a highly stressfulevent , adrenalize and stres hormones cause memory to be faulty at best .

Trachyte is mostly sanidine feldspar , with little or no quartz , and mafic minerals such as augite and hornblende . Carbonatites contain more than 50 % carbonate minerals .",1

"What exactly is antimatter ? Howmuch of it has been produced till today ? Antimatter or contra-terrene matter is matter that is composed of the antiparticles of those that constitute normal matter . If a particle and its antiparticle come in contact with each other , the two annihilate and produce a burst of energy , which results in the production of other particles and antiparticles or electromagnetic radiation . In these reactions , rest mass is not conserved , although ( as in any other reaction ) energy ( E=mc² ) is conserved.Scientists in 1995 succeeded in producing antiatoms of hydrogen , and also antideuteron nuclei , made out of an antiproton and an antineutron , but no antiatom more complex than antideuterium has been created yet . In principle , antiatoms of any element could be built from readily available sources of antiparticles . Such antiatoms would have exactly the same properties as their normal-matter counterparts . The production of antielements in bulk quantities seems unlikely to ever become achievable , however.Positrons and antiprotons can individually be stored in a device called a Penning trap , which uses a combination of magnetic field and electric fields to hold charged particles in a vacuum . Two international collaborations , ATRAP and ATHENA , used these devices to store thousands of slowly moving antihydrogen atoms in 2002 . It is the goal of these collaborations to probe the energy level structure of antihydrogen to compare it with that of hydrogen as a test of the CPT theorem . One way to do this is to confine the antiatoms in an inhomogenous magnetic field ( one can not use electric fields since the antiatoms are neutral ) and interrogate them with lasers . If the anti-atoms have too much kinetic energy they will be able to escape the magnetic trap , and it is therefore essential that the anti-atoms be produced with as little energy as possible . This is the key difference between the antihydrogen that ATRAP and ATHENA produced , which was made at very low temperatures , and the antihydrogen produced in 1995 which was moving at a speed close to the speed of light.Antimatter/matter reactions have practical applications in medical imaging , such as positron emission tomography ( PET ) . In some kinds of beta decay , a nuclide loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron ( in the same event , a proton becomes a neutron , and neutrinos are also given off ) . Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a cyclotron and are widely generated for medical use.Antiparticles are created everywhere in the universe where high-energy particle collisions take place , such as in the center of our galaxy , but none has been detected that is residual from the Big Bang , as most normal matter is . [ 1 ] The unequal distribution between matter and antimatter in the universe has long been a mystery . The solution likely lies in the violation of CP-symmetry by the laws of nature ; see baryogenesis.how much produced it is on and on and on",1

"why do we see upside down through raindrops ? My vision is n't good enough to actually `` look '' through a raindrop , but I understand your question . Raindrops are a lot like a lens . In fact , a raindrop is a lens . Every lens has a focal length based on its shape and material and when objects within the focal length , they are magnified . Raindrops , however , have a very short focal length so anything you see through them will likely be beyond the focal length . Objects beyond the focal length are not necessarily magnified , and in fact they are flipped . It 's much easier to understand with a ray tracing diagram .

"What 's a platypus ? It 's one of the few egg-laying mammals . It 's scientific name , Ornithorhynchus anatinus , means something like `` bird-beaked duck-like '' .

Interestingly , platypuses are among the few venomous mammals : they have a `` spur '' in their hind feet associated with a venom gland that they use in fighting each other . Another interesting thing : adults do n't have teeth , they rely on ridged horny plates inside their mouth to crush the harder parts of the invertebrates that they feed on . However , juveniles do have functional molars with the same basic pattern as other mammals.They occur only in Australia at present , but fossil platypuses have been found in Patagonia , Argentina , so we know that their past distribution was wider.If you have the chance , watch the first episode of the David Attenborough 's series `` Life of mammals '' ; some of the best images of living monotremes I 've seen .",1

If I continue the movements at 1/2 increments of my proevious move , I am still moving forward but theoretically I never reach my destination which is a fixed point . Is that correct ? Does that mean that there are an infinite amount of numbers between 1 & 2 ? What you are describing is an infinite series using a decreasing geometric progression . The sum of such a series can be described by this proof : Let T = total distance traveled ( in spaces ) Then T = 1 + ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ... Also T - 1 = ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ... And if we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:2* ( T - 1 ) = 2* ( ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ... ) Multiplying through:2T - 2 = 1 + ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ...

"Why should high school teenagers do their best in school ? What benefits will they get out of it ? I can tell you just how important it is to do well in high school and make sure to take all the courses you can.When i was in high school , i floated around and didnt spend enough time on my studies . The result was that i graduated with the bare minimum grades and classes of course . I went into college at age 17 , and did not understand why everybody was 24-25 years old . They told me that they didnt think education was important so they went to work after high school . I didnt listen to them . Now at age 24 , i had to redo or do classes i didnt complete in high school to get back into college and university that i should have done in high school . I wasted precious time in my life and could have been a doctor by now if i had put effort into high school . Please dont make the same mistake i did , be diligent in your studies , you will no regret it . Education will no guarantee a good salary but you can use every bit of luck to do well in this life and education will increase your chances to do that . good luck !",0

"How is `` Evolution '' plausible or logical ? Simply because Darwin used well developed ( by humans , but well developed nonetheless ) , well proven , scientific methodolgy instead of relying on the dogmas of a belief system to base his observations on.Keep in mind that , in science , there are very few laws any longer . Everything is a theory because , especially after relativity , scientists discovered that our universe does n't stay consistent as you move into and out of certain states ( like the speed of light ) . However , this does not eliminate the theory as quackery or false . It means that the theory can only be applied in certain circumstances ( it 's relative to certain states ) so it can not be a `` law '' as laws are immutable.That being said , science only has observable evidence as it 's foundation ( or provable evidence through mathematics ) . Darwin observed the various species on the Galapagos islands and drew conclusions as to the nature of their adaptations ( long beaks , short beaks , etc. ) . He also observed that various birds with nearly identical characteristics had slight variations in their adaptations . This caused him to draw other conclusions . In short , he used a scientific process to develop early versions of his theory of evolution . It has been scrutinized since , and the only ones `` disproving '' it have been those who belive religious texts are God 's absolute word.I am a believer in Christ , yet I see no issue with believing there is truth to Darwin 's theories . Did God ultimately create all things ? Of course He did . However , is the Bible absolute in it 's description in the origins of life ? Probably not . Even Christ , according to the biblical record , spoke in stories ( parables ) most of the time so people would understand his message and have examples to work from . He rarely spoke in absolutes , and when he did it was usually only with the apostles.I belive that Genesis is a parable describing God 's creation of all that is , in an understandable way since it is unlikely that we will ever completely understand how He did it . However , even I admit it is only a belief , and may be wrong , like Darwin may be wrong , or literal interpretations of Genesis may be wrong .",0

"Is mastarbation harmful for health ? Health and psychological effectsIt is held in many mental health circles that masturbation can relieve depression and lead to a higher sense of self-worth . Masturbation can also be particularly useful in relationships where one partner wants more sex than the other—in which case masturbation provides a balancing effect and thus a more harmonious relationship.Both from the standpoint of avoiding unwanted pregnancy and that of avoiding sexually transmitted diseases , masturbation is the safest of sexual practices . There is no credible scientific or medical evidence that manual masturbation is damaging to either one 's mental or physical health.A man whose penis has suffered `` an invasive procedure , blunt trauma or injury during intercourse '' [ 2 ] may suffer later in life from Peyronie 's disease . Usually in the context of an abnormal tunica albuginea , the rare event of penile fracture [ 3 ] may occur . Phimosis is `` a contracted foreskin ( that ) may cause trouble by hurting when an attempt is made to pull the foreskin back '' [ 4 ] . In each of these cases , overly aggressive manipulation of the penis can be problematic.Contrary to popular myth , masturbation does not cause blindness . There is some basis , however , to the myth : zinc is required both to transport vitamin A from the liver to the retina and is excreted in relatively high amount in semen . Thus , it is not inconceivable that in zinc-deficient or vitamin A-deficient environments excessive male masturbation could have caused night blindness ( in which case sexual intercourse has an equal probability of causing blindness ) . Given a normal contemporary diet , however , this is extremely unlikely to happen . There is also the more modern issue of staring at a computer screen while watching pornography for extended periods of time as the pupils tend to dilate during arousal.The only side-effects recorded are that repeated masturbation may result in tiredness or soreness , which tend to make repeated masturbation self-limiting in any case . For men , the volume of ejaculate is temporarily reduced after multiple ejaculations until normal seminal volume is regained in a day or so . Nevertheless , people may experience feelings of guilt during or after masturbation , especially if they come from a socially conservative or religious background.Solitary masturbation carries no risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases . Masturbation involving both a man and a woman can result in pregnancy only if semen contacts the vulva . Any masturbation with a partner can theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted disease by contact with bodily fluids , and such contact should be avoided with any partner whose disease status is uncertain . Objects inserted into the vagina or anus should be clean and of a kind that will not scratch or break . Care should be taken not to fully insert anything into the anus—any object used should have a flared or flanged base ; otherwise retrieval can require a visit to the emergency room . Most modern dildos and anal plugs are designed with this feature.In 1994 , when the first woman appointed Surgeon General of the United States , Dr. Joycelyn Elders , mentioned as an aside that perhaps it ought to be mentioned in school curricula that masturbation was safe and healthy , she was forced to resign , with opponents asserting that she was promoting the teaching of how to masturbate . Many believe this was the result of her long history of promoting controversial viewpoints and not due solely to her public mention of masturbation . Her case led to the coining of a new and humorous slang term for masturbation : Firing the surgeon general.On July 16 , 2003 , an Australian research team led by Graham Giles of The Cancer Council published a medical study [ 5 ] which concluded that frequent masturbation by males may help prevent the development of prostate cancer . The study also indicated that this would be more helpful than ejaculati",0

"In politics what does The Right & The Left mean ( what connection to Democrats/Republicans ) ? The left and right ends of the political spectrum discribe people 's basic philosopy of government . Most people think of Democrats of being left center and liberals comfortably in the left and Socialists at the extreme left . On the right side , Republicans would be near the center , Conservatives comfortable in the right and libetarians at the far right.The right tends to favor policies in which the role of the government is extremely limited , especially when it comes to promoting the general welfare of the populous , but at the same time spending adequate resouces for the common defense of the nation such as the military and the enforcement of international trade agreements . Some issues that the Right traditionally cares about are : * Minimize Taxes* Minimize Social Welfare Programs ( Social Security , Medicaid , Medicare ) * Minimize Regulations on Business and Individuals* Elimination of Wealth Redistribution policies such as Progressive Taxation , Asset Based Taxation , and Taxation on Income gained through investment or inheritance . * Minimize ability of citizens to sue the government or corporations , or other individuals based on laws designed to protect the environment , consumers , workers , women , minorities , etc ... .Recently , the Right has embraced other non traditional issues such as : * Increased government regulation of Abortion* Increased government regulation of End of Life decisions* Increased government regulation of Drug Usage* Increased Government funding of Christian religious groups , symbols and priorities . * Increased Government regulation of sexual pratices , indecent speech , homosexuality and unpatriotic behavior . * Decreased regulation of weapon ownership . * Support for public execution of certain criminals . * Reduction of constitutional gaurantees for accused criminals ( Victims Rights ) The left tends to favor a stronger government with policies which benefit the general population at the expense of those in positions of power . People on the left tend to believe that the government 's primary function is to provide for the general welfare of its citizens paid for by taxing the populous . Some issues that the left traditionally cares about are : * Generous funding of Social Programs ( Social Security , Medicaid , Medicare ) * A progressive tax system which taxes wealthy individuals at a higher rate and taxes income earned by means other than work ( Profits , Investment , Inheritence ) higher than work income . * Increased government regulation of employers , polluters , manufacturers , and individuals in the interests of protecting the populous* Protecting Certain Freedoms such as freedom of speech , freedom of the press , right to privacy , voting rights , rights of the accused , etc ... .Recently , the Left has embraced other non traditional issues such as : * Legalization of Abortion* Affirmative Action* Increased regulation of weapon Ownership* Less strict Immigration laws* Opposition of certain wars* Separation of Church and State",0

"What are the basic differences that separate Roman Catholicism and Protestantism ? I think a major difference is that Protestants believe that you can not get to heaven on your own merit , that you must confess your sins and trust in Jesus as God 's son who died as a sacrifice for your sins ; they believe that you can not avoid sin on your own , that you must rely on Jesus as a redeemer , but that you will want to do good works out of appreciation for God 's salvation through Jesus . I think that Roman Catholics believe that you must acknowledge that Jesus is God 's son , but also that you have to do good works to get to heaven.From what I understand , Protestants believe that you can/should directly ask Jesus to forgive your sins , while Roman Catholics believe that you can/should confess your sins to a priest , who will in turn be your `` intercessor '' to Jesus/God . Also , Protestants believe that only Jesus/God/Holy Spirit are holy and that the Virgin Mary ( Jesus ' mother ) or other `` saints '' are just regular people , saved by God 's grace/Jesus . Roman Catholics believe that the Virgin Mary and other `` saints '' are holy , and can be prayed to for miracles or forgiveness.For the most part , I think that Protestants believe that when you die , you will go to heaven or hell . Roman Catholics believe that you might go to purgatory ( where you are `` purged '' of your sins before you get into heaven ) . I think there 's also `` Limbo , '' which is a place where babies can go if they have n't been able to comprehend the choice between heaven and hell.There are , of course , a lot of different divisions within Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths , so a lot of these are generalizations , and will not necessarily apply to a Protesant or Roman Catholic person 's personal beliefs .",0

"What do you think if Hawaii declare independence from the US. ? I feel that Hawaii will not succeed in declaring independence . The best the Hawaiian people can reasonably hope for is to obtain the same status as American Indians . I believe we can possibly obtain status as Native Americans , obtain some lands and our own sovereign rights to those lands . The lands held by the State should be returned . This would give us several beach parks and awapua'a , it would return several palaces and the Royal Mausoleum . But , there are too many kamaaina in Hawaii to reasonably expect they would support a complete withdrawal from the U.S. ( One could always hope , but one also needs to be realistic in our demands in order to obtain anything . )",0

It really depends . Public entities do not work very fast . If you need to resolve your claim , not so much fast , but faster , you should file a claim with your own insurance company . Once you settle your claim with your own insurance company , your insurance company will subrogate the claim and go after the `` highway department '' for the money they paid you . So long as you are paid what you are owed by your insurance company , the highway department may drag their feet as long as they like . Hope that helps .",0

"What does sexual side effect mean ? Personal Side Effectsof StatinsImpotence , Loss of Libido and Erectile Dysfunction The pharmaceutical industry would lead us to believe that rapidly bottoming out our natural cholesterol levels through the use of their highly touted statin drugs is a relatively innocuous process of definite benefit to society . But as we learn more each day of this ubiquitous and unique cholesterol substance , we must question the veracity of their medical advisors . Cholesterol is perhaps the most important substance in our lives for we could not live without an abundant supply of it in our bodies . Researchers everywhere are learning how extraordinarily complex and often surprising are the pathways that produce and metabolize cholesterol . Cholesterol is the precursor for a whole class of hormones known as the steroid hormones that are absolutely critical for life , as we know it . These hormones determine our sexuality , control the reproductive process , and regulate blood sugar levels and mineral metabolism . This same substance that society has been taught to fear happens to be our sole source for our hormones , androgen , estrogen and progesterone .",0

"Why is the Interior of an airplaine pressurized and what would happen if there was a hole in the exterior wall Explain why the interior of an airplane is pressurized when flying at high altitude . If a hole were punctured in an exterior wall , what would happen to the air pressure inside the plane ? An Airplane is pressurised to provide the same pressure as at sea level , or ground altitude for passanger confort and to provent altutiude sickness . You can not breath the air at 20,000 feet with the same amount of oxygen per beath as at sea level . You would pass out from a lack of oxygen . If you get a hole in the airplane outer wall bernoullis principle says that there would be a fall in presure vacume on the other side of the hole causeing a depressurization of the interior of the aircraft to the pressure of 20,000 feet . With a Depressure of cabin air you would see a fog of water droplets in the air , as the density of water in the air becomes more from the oxygen being sucked out of the cabin . As you have seen in movies the hole will be riped larger if it is big enough to alow a large amount of air though and the structure is weak enough in that area . In alot of aircrafts the outer wall is a part of the pressure system of the aircraft keeping a seperation between internal pressure and external pressure . The whole aircraft is not pressureized wings and rear areas . so a hole in those area would n't cause a problum for the passangers .",0

"a canadien hockey player in 1985 ? a canadien hockey player in 1985 On February 22 , 2002 , Wayne Gretzky made history as the architect of Canada 's first gold medal in Olympic men 's hockey in 50 years . It proved that three years after retirement , `` The Great One 's '' contribution to the game and country he loves is not over.Gretzky was only ten years old when his talent as the defenceman-winger-centre for the Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers caught the attention of Toronto Telegram sportswriter John Iaboni . His story about the prolific 369-goal scorer turned out to be a glimpse of what was in store for the greatest hockey player to lace up a pair of skates . Gretzky was born on January 26 , 1961 . By age two his father and `` greatest coach , '' Walter already had his son on skates . By the time he joined the Nadrofsky Steelers , he already had a reputation of carving out scoring opportunities against players twice his age and taller than his modest height.At 15 , he joined the Ontario Hockey Association , turning professional two years later as an underage junior with the Indianapolis Racers in the now defunct World Hockey Association ( WHA ) . He only played eight games for the Racers ( chalking up three goals and three assists ) before being traded to the WHA 's Edmonton Oilers where he was named WHA Rookie of the Year.In 1979 , the Edmonton Oilers entered the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . Gretzky remained in Edmonton nine seasons , leading the Oilers to four Stanley Cups , and helping to build hockey 's strongest franchise of the 1980s.Not surprisingly , Gretzky 's trade to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988 made front-page news and topped all national newscasts . Gretzky was the ambassador of hockey ; the struggling Kings needed to fill seats , and the NHL wanted to promote its game in the United States.Since joining the NHL , Gretzky has had more impact on the record book than any other player . By the time he retired , The Great One held over 60 NHL records and most of the sport 's prestigious hardware , including nine Hart Trophies for most valuable player and five Lester B. Pearson Trophies for MVP as voted by other players.His most cherished record , however , came on October 25 , 1989 , when he scored two goals and an assist to surpass the all-time points record set by his hero , Gordie Howe.Wayne Gretzky retired from professional hockey as a New York Ranger on April 18 , 1999 . In addition to the NHL , and his considerable charity work , he has made Canadians proud on the world stage - particularly as Executive Director of Team Canada for the 2002 Winter Olympics . Additionally , Gretzky is part owner of the Phoenix Coyotes.Canada 's Walk of Fame Trivia : Wayne Gretzky 's first jersey was No . 9 after his hockey hero , Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings .",0

"where did Billie Holiday go to school ? Sounds like school was a big part of her life , if any.Born Eleanora Fagan , she had a difficult childhood which affected her life and career . Much of Holiday 's childhood is clouded by conjecture and legend , some of it propagated by herself in her autobiography published in 1956 . She was born in Philadelphia but grew up in the Fells Point section of Baltimore . According to her autobiography , her house was the first on their street to have electricity . Her mother , Sadie Fagan , was just thirteen at the time of her birth ; her father Clarence Holiday , a jazz guitarist who would play for Fletcher Henderson , was fifteen . Billie Holiday 's parents married when she was three , but they soon divorced , leaving her to be raised largely by her mother and other relatives . A hardened and angry child , she dropped out of school at an early age and , allegedly , began working as a prostitute with her mother . This preceded her move to New York with her mother sometime in the early 1930s.There is controversy regarding Holiday 's paternity . This stems from a copy of her birth certificate in Baltimore archives that lists the father as a `` Frank DeViese '' . Some historians consider this an anomaly , probably inserted by a hospital or government worker ( See Donald Clarke , Billie Holiday : Wishing on the Moon , ISBN 0306811367 ) . Clarence Holiday accepted paternity , but was hardly a responsible father . In the rare times Billie did see him , she would shake him down for money by threatening to tell his then-girlfriend that Holiday was his daughter .",0

"Should the Phil . invest money donated by western countrries on developing on agri . area 's into industr'l zone ? *Economic Impact*Social and physiological needs*psychological impact*Advantage and disadvantage Investing money to develop agricultural areas into industrial zones is good -- -partly though.First of all , the Philippines is an agricultural nation . Perhaps some agricultural areas should be developed , but not all . Since it is an agricultural nation , it derives its economy from agriculture . If these areas will be developed into industrial zones , a good part of the economy will be crippled.Second , people who depend on agriculture for a living will lost their jobs . If their skills are only limited to agriculture , where will they go once these areas are industrialized ? Lastly , and this is just my opinion , if agricultural areas will be turned into industrial zones , and considering that the money comes from Western countries , the Philippines will then have a debt of gratitude to these nations . Meaning , its government will do whatever these nations will tell them to do . Another form of colonization , eh ?

They 're the most common congenital malformations in newborns . In most cases scientists do n't know why they occur . Sometimes a viral infection causes serious problems . German measles ( rubella ) is an example . If a woman contracts German measles while pregnant , it can interfere with how her baby 's heart develops or produce other malformations . Other viral diseases also may cause congenital defects.Heredity sometimes plays a role in congenital cardiovascular defects . More than one child in a family may have a congenital cardiovascular defect , but this rarely occurs . Certain conditions affecting multiple organs , such as Down 's syndrome , can involve the heart , too . Some prescription drugs and over-the-counter medicines , as well as alcohol and `` street '' drugs , may increase the risk of having a baby with a heart defect . Researchers are studying other factors . ''",0

( here was their official platform in 1948 , including segregation- http : //www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/dixiecrat1.html ) it pretty much fell apart after the 1948 election.Basically , a dixiecrat is a person that stands by the old line democrat platform of segregationist policies ( the Democrats used to be the conservative party , and the Republican party was the progressive party- this started to change between the election cycles of 1932 and 1940 with FDR ) - the dixiecrats were formed in response to Truman 's integration of the armed services and the overall democrat civil rights plank.Basically in answer to your question , no there really are n't any people around anymore that believe in the Democratic party but are against it 's policies . Even `` yellow dog '' Democrats are no longer the type of people that support the party without supporting it 's causes . The death knell for the dixiecrats was when Thurmond switched over to the Republican party ... the rest fell in line behind him like dominos .",0

"Should car be banned in city centre ? Please give me the reason and more details because I need to write a arguement essay on it . Well , there are two sides to this issue - I do n't know if you are arguing in favor , or against it - so here goes.On the plus side ( i.e . banning cars in the city center ) , you would reduce traffic , congestion , wear and tear on the streets . You could hold events ( parades , celebrations , rally 's , etc . ) in the area without significantly affecting traffic . Also , car-free areas in the downtown ( i.e . city center ) can help to revitalize an area of the downtown - it can be made to look nice , maybe with something like nice bricks , or cobblestones.On the other hand ( against banning cars in the city center ) , if you ban cars in the downtown area , you 'll be loosing revenue from on-street parking and any parking tickets the city issues , depending upon the size of the car-free area , it will be more difficult to get to the city center , it might adversely affect sales for businesses in the affected area.One option , used in downtown Minneapolis ( Nicollet Mall ) allows taxis and busses , but not private ( i.e . car ) traffic . This allows people to get down to the area via public transportation , or by taking a taxi . Of course , it 's only one block wide by several ( 5 or 6 I think ) blocks long.Here are two sites that might provide helpful information : http : //www.worldcarfree.net/http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_street",0
"Where can I find a cheap LCD Monitor ? There are a ton of specs for monitors , which ones are important and which ones just make it cost more ? I 'd like to scrap my big monitor if I can find a good one . The main thing with LCD monitors is response time . If you play games a low response time causes ghosting effects which makes the image appear blurred , one with a fast response time ( 16ms or better ) will not have this problem . You are in luck , the prices of LCD monitors have plummeted in the past few years and you can get a very good one from either Viewsonic or Samsung for around $ 200 for a 17 '' LCD monitor which has a resolution of 1280 x 1024 and 15 '' monitors have a resolution of 1024 x 768 . I would get a 17 '' . There are n't many other factors to consider besides maybe contrast ratio which is measured in ratios like 450:1 but tests have shown each manufacturer uses their own scale and some 450:1 monitors made by Samsung and Viewsonic are actually brighter and sharper than 600:1 monitors made by off-brand companies.At any rate , you ca n't go wrong with Viewsonic or Samsung and you just ca n't beat Newegg for selection or service.17 '' Viewsonics here , http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp ?

"How many jumps are there in each set of volleyball match for each player ? At lower levels of play , e.g. , recreational leagues , the number of jumps varies by the player 's ability . The best players ( on recreational teams ) gets the lion-share of the sets , and thus , jumps a lot more than others . The ratio between best and worst players on the court could mean 25 jumps to zero . Additionally , the offense usually consists of `` high outside '' sets , with no `` quick attack '' in the middle , and thus , reduced the number of jumps required to block . However , at higher levels of play , the number of jumps varies by position more than ability . The least number of jumps go the outside hitters , both power and weak-side ( a/k/a , `` opposite '' ) . Their numbers are roughly inverses of each other , for obvious positional reasons . Figure 9-12 spike attempts for power hitters , and 4-7 blocks ; the opposite hitter gets the opposite numbers : 4-7 spike attempts , and 9-12 spikes .

"Why is an abortion so easy to get ? Although I think abortion should remain legal , I think it should be harder to get one . All you need is $ 500 . Some girls use it as their only form of birth control . There are many states in which a girl under 18 does n't even have to have her parents permission . [ You ca n't even get your EARS peirced without parental consent . ] Maybe there should be mandatory counseling before and after . Before to go throught he options in handling an unwanted pregnancy ( adoption and so forth ) . And then after to deal with emotional effects of the abortion . What do you think ? if it was hard , women and girls would go to underground clinics , secret places or somewhere where they can get one . its the law of supply and demand . plus the medical consequenses of a backroom abortion could be devastating . at least clinical is safe . who knows what could happen in an uncertified environment . also , clinical provides JOBS , AND THEY MAKE A TON OF MONEY . just like cigarettes or alcohol , if they know they can kill you why is it legal , simple -- MONEY AND JOBS . lobbyists for these groups donate to politicians to get legislation in their favor . money talks . if abortion was illegal all the clinics , doctors , nurses , support staff would be unemployed and have to find another job , not good for the economy . thats why they do n't shut down big business , tobacco farmers would be devastated and the grain farmers , distillers , and distributors would have no job . it all about money , politics and keeping your job and the government getting the TAX DOLLARS generated from these enterprises . its sad but thats the system governments use to generate revenue",0

"How can there be many ways to God ? Let not your heart be troubled : ye believe in God , believe also in me . Jesus saith unto him , I am the way , the truth , and the life : no man cometh unto the Father , but by me.If ye had known me , ye should have known my Father also : and from henceforth ye know him , and have seen him.Can it be shown in scripture ? Can it be shown in any other writings from God ? If it can not be shown , why not ? May God bless you all for your answers..In Jesus Most Precious Name..EyeLovesJesus For those who say there are many ways because there are so many people I respectfully disagree . The is only one God and one Way . Do most know that the early church was actually called The Way ? Why because the followed the One who said there is only One Way that being Christ . How can there be many ways when they are all so different . Some say works , some sacrafice , some even say self reliance . But consider this if God is perfect can you stand before Him ? Can you say let me in for I am a rightous man on my own certinly not . So then we need to be perfect before the Father . Can we do anything to be perfect ? Certinly not . For being a christian will not get you into heaven , on the contary being a christian will get you no where . Jesus on the other hand can stand before the Father , He can be Rightous and Holy before God on your behalf . But not if you do not accept Him for what He is and for what He has done . For on the day of judgment ( there will be judgement ) The Father will judge all men and see whom is in His Son and they shall be forgiven . Only one way to heaven , thank the Lord we have a way .

"definition of discovery teaching approach ? The discovery method is a teaching technique that encourages students to take a more active role in their learning process by answering a series of questions or solving problems designed to introduce a general concept . In this teaching approach , the instructor guides the student ’ s thought process by posing a series of questions whose responses would lead to the understanding of a concept before it is explicitly stated . “ Children act as detectives as they solve concept-attainment activities in stimulating learning environments . In doing so , they place a newly introduced object in a category that they have previously discovered or identified. ” This teaching method is believed to increase retention of material because the student organizes the new information and integrates it with information that has already been stored .",0

"what is an interrupt ? There is a good summary of what an interrupt is at the sources listed below . Cutting and pasting the content from one link : A signal informing a program that an event has occurred . When a program receives an interrupt signal , it takes a specified action ( which can be to ignore the signal ) . Interrupt signals can cause a program to suspend itself temporarily to service the interrupt . Interrupt signals can come from a variety of sources . For example , every keystroke generates an interrupt signal . Interrupts can also be generated by other devices , such as a printer , to indicate that some event has occurred . These are called hardware interrupts . Interrupt signals initiated by programs are called software interrupts . A software interrupt is also called a trap or an exception . PCs support 256 types of software interrupts and 15 hardware interrupts . Each type of software interrupt is associated with an interrupt handler -- a routine that takes control when the interrupt occurs . For example , when you press a key on your keyboard , this triggers a specific interrupt handler . The complete list of interrupts and associated interrupt handlers is stored in a table called the interrupt vector table , which resides in the first 1 K of addressable memory .",0

"how do you get rid of pregnancy nausea ? Cinnamon tea , an old herbal remedy may help and it does not cost much to try it if you like and can drink cinnamon tea . Steep 2 � tablespoon cinnamon bark or powder in boiling water for ten minutes . Strain , add honey to taste and drink � cup three times a day before meals . You may also buy herbal cinnamon tea bags available at most supermarket.Pregnancy is such an exciting time in life , but for some it is marred by the discomfort of morning sickness or nausea . This is most unpleasant at best and if severe , dehydration can cause multiple problems . None of this is necessary as there is an effective way to relieve the nausea with Myofascial Trigger Point Therapy ( Applied pressure to trigger points in a muscle area ) .Although it has not been proven , the ongoing theory is that hormonal changes trigger spasm in the Pyloric Sphincter ( the muscle surrounding the opening that leaves the stomach ) . Because Myofascial Trigger Point Therapy can relieve muscle spasms of all sorts , it can also relieve the Pyloric Sphincter spasm causing morning sickness , known in the medical field as Hyperemesis Gravidarum . The nausea can start about the 4th week of pregnancy up until the 12th week and for some into the 2nd trimester.However , I have discovered an easy method to eliminate morning sickness . During this stage , the trigger points in the Pyloric Sphincter area are very tender , usually painful and just too uncomfortable to put pressure on one self ; therefore you will need a friend or your husband to help you . You may feel nauseated right afterwards but do not feel discouraged there will be relief a bit later . You may need to repeat this every 3 hours if the nausea returns . If the trigger points are too tender to repeat every 3 hours , repeat every 6 hours . This way you can at least get some food and fluids down to maintain good nutrition.If the nausea is severe , try eating only food , ( omitting liquids ) at meal times and take your fluids between meals . Milk just brought to the boil and then refrigerated is quite pleasant and a good food source.Let me explain why it works and how I discovered it . I am a Registered Nurse and have worked many years in the anti-partum unit at a good size hospital in Orange County . This unit treats patients with difficult pregnancies . One of the common problems is dehydration due to severe nausea called Hyperemesis Gravidarum . Most doctors prescribe intravenous fluids and medication for nausea . This does not always work and the nausea and vomiting often continues which puts the patient in a starvation situation forcing the treating doctor to order Hyper alimentation fluid . A complete nutritional fluid given intravenously that costs approximately $ 500 a bag and is given over a twenty-four hour period . The patient is still nauseated and vomiting but is fed nutritionally and may need this feeding for 2 to 3 weeks and sometimes more.Now I found that if I used an easy method of helping the pregnant mom and taught her husband how to help his wife , when she was first admitted and given some intravenous fluid she would go home in a day or two . However if I was not on duty and and the patient had been started on the Hyper alimentation fluid , my method did not seem effective . The patient would still suffer nausea although she would receive adequate nutrition.So if you are pregnant , fear nausea and want to make sure you feel good all the time and not have to go through all this hospital suffering , you may want to print this health tip . Have your husband help with the procedure even before you experience nausea , just as a preventative measure.NOTE : This procedure may also bring some very quick relief from gastric problems when they are caused by spasm of the Pyloric Sphincter.FOLLOW THIS EASY METHOD : Xiphoid Process.gif ( 7811 bytes ) 1 ) Have the mother lie flat on her back with her helper to one side.2 ) Start two inches below the Xiphoid Process which is the bottom tip of the S",0

"Should I start my kids ( 5 and 8 years old ) on skiing or snowboarding first ? I want them to learn both ? I would say skiing , and here is why : The first day out , you want your kids to have a good time . If they get a bad first impression , you could be in for fifteen years of boring vacations sitting on beaches or whatever non-skiers/boarders do on vacations . Anyne will tell you that the first day on a board you spend it on your rear end . I had big purple welts the first time . With skiing , you fall a little bit , but with separate feet you are at least standing most of the time . Secondly , when skiing , you gradually progress over many years to become an avid skier . With snowboarding , you either can snowboard or you ca n't . The kids will want to learn to snowboard , despite the bad first day , once they are into the whole winter sports thing . So use skiing to get them to have a good time , then , once they are parallel skiing , let them snowboard . about 18 years ago , when me and my brother were beginners , he switched to snowboarding . I waited another couple years . Now I do both expertly , and the one time he tried skiing , he broke his leg trying to keep up with me . He never mastered skiing because he could n't appreciate the slower learning process of the sport . kids are impatient . If they have a bad first ten minutes they want to go home . If it is too much work to learn something similar to something they are already good at , they wo n't learn it . good luck .",0

"how could i install program to other drive ? It depends on the program.Most professional programs will allow you to choose between a CUSTOM INSTALL and an Express Install . If so , choose CUSTOM INSTALL . This will allow you to choose program features to install and , usually , the installation folder . For the installation folder , there will usually be a BROWSE button . Click on that and select the drive and folder for the installation.If there is n't a CUSTOM INSTALL choice , you still might be presented with a default folder and a BROWSE button . Click on the BROWSE button and select the drive and folder you want to use.NOTE : Most programs allow you to type in your own folder name , even if it does n't already exist . These programs will usually tell you the folder does n't exist and ask your permission to create the folder . Click YES or OK to create the folder.I highly suggest that you keep a well-organized naming scheme throughout your use of the computer.EXAMPLE : I have a C : & # 92 ; Program Files & # 92 ; under which I have a lot of program folders .

"has does alcohol and bipolar disorder effect each other ? Yes.If a person is taking medication for a bi-polar ailment , then the effects of alcohol can not be adequately surmised on the behavioral aspects of the person in question .

Alcohol , being a depressant , usually has the affect on this type of individual as making them reach their `` lows '' , and they can be quite violent and destructive.Anyone with bi-polar disease should ALWAYS be careful on ANY medications injested .

"What kind of lies did the Ku Klux Klan tell ? An why did people go along with it for so long ? There are so many articles about the Klu Klux Klan that it boggles the mind . In a nutshell they - like Nazi Germany - beleived that the white race was omnipotent and that all other races are/were subservient or corrupt in some manner . Therefore they agreed that by process of elimination , they would rule as the all powerful white race . This misguided belief was fueled in part by the rife prejudices in the southern parts of the US . Since they beleived that blacks and other races were not in their white power plan , and these races were no better than dogs and should be treated as such , they proceeded with a process called culling . This is where they mistakenly thought that they could rule society and that everyone would go along with their beliefs . They used the bible and twisted its teachings to enforce their beliefs . A lot of people went along with it , in part , because of the slavery and its abolition in later years , but also because it was the `` Christian '' thing to do . Some thought that if they were true christians they had to go along with it , because they beleived the words of the Grand wizard . The Klu Klux Klan was a secret society for a long time . Mostly joined by angry white southern gentlemen who didnt like the abolition of slavery . I use the term gentlemen loosely . If you google the name it will come up and you can read all about it..",0

"how do i love Krishna ? If Krishna is a neighbor , then that 's fine . But if it is to love and serve as God , to find truth , or to worship then you are in trouble my friend . If you want to go to a destination , say Key West , you must first move toward that direction , and take the only road that leads you there , for all others roads will not get you there . And so it is with truth for God is not relative , for neither is truth . Any Religion will not take you to God . Religion is mans way to God , Christianity is Gods way to man . Jesus Christ said `` I am the truth , the light , the way and that no one comes to the Father but through him '' Some may call that narrow minded , but no one ever claimed to be who he was , then proved what he claimed to be . We all shall stand before God and give account of our lives , what we did with what God blessed us with , and the most important question is what we did with the truth of his word by receiving Jesus Christ , his son as the supreme love of our life . The odds of dying are still 1:1 . We all shall receive eternal life , many in heaven who accepted Christ , and others in hell whom rejected him . Jesus Christ is the only way to Heaven .

"Receiving child support from someone on public assistance ? My husband has custody of his daughter and his daughter 's mother ( who does not see her anymore -- it 's been almost 10 months now ) is on public assistance and disability ( because of having bi-polar disorder , I guess ) . He wants to file for support because when HE did not have custody he paid his support faithfully . And he feels she needs to support her kid too . But he is curious if he will GET any support . I was told they would just subtract the support amount from the assistance amount and send the custodial parent the difference . But it would be nice to see if anyone else has had this experience before he files and takes time off work to do it . As long as there is not a medical condition preventing her from working she will be required to pay child support . The child support can be deducted out of her pay check . The amount of her assistance wo n't change . Even if she is on assistance the law requires that she supports her daughter the same way that her dad did .",0

"Why do white men like asian chicks so much ? This is probably not the first time you come across this phenomenon . These days , you see a great number of white men wanting to be with asian chicks other than gals of other races . What qualities about asian chicks that white men like about ? Why do asian chicks want to be with white men ? An input from both male and female would be good ! Men believe ( rightly or wrongly ) that an Asian girl will be more submissive or docile . They stereotype Asian women in that way based upon what they see in movies or based upon what they hear goes on in Asia . Some Asian women are attracted to white men because they want someone who does n't treat them as subserviant . They want to be treated as an equal . See what can go wrong in this picture ? Obviously many relationships between Asians and westerners work just fine , but if someone is just trying to attract `` any Asian '' or `` any white guy '' , there could be a problem . As far as physical attraction , perhaps some are attracted by the more youthful appearance , but some may also be attracted by the fact that in general , Asians tend to be slimmer than western women . Many guys find that attractive . Guys look at a woman 's mother for a clue at what his girl may look like in the future . Asian parents tend to be slimmer than western parents . There is some male input for you .",0
".SINCE CUSTOMERS KNOWN THEIR NEED AND WANTS THERE IS NO NEED FOR MARKETING DISCUSS ? Lets assume customers know all the products available in the market place . Most often there exists similar or substitute products in the market for example the chocolate market , Cadburys vs Nestle or in the soft drinks market Coca Cola vs Pepsi Cola or the car market . How would a potential buyer choose what brand to buy since it ’ s the same product ? To answer this question we must think in marketing terms such as the 4 p ’ s which are product , price , place and promotion . Price communicates a lot about the product such as , expensive means that the product is of the highest quality . Or cheap which can say – buy lots of me but don ’ t give it to your loved ones as a birthday present . Promotion is used to get customers to hear about the product and get them to try it . Product promotion is a strategy used to increase sales , increase product/brand awareness or get rid of stock . A product promotion could be a BOGOF ( buy one get one free ) , by one get second half price , money off coupons , etc . These strategies are used to get customers to buy more of your product or simply try it for the first time.Marketing is the process of exchanging products or the art of persuading people to buy your product . I said exchange because a customer will exchange money for the product they are buying , with so many me too products in the market place a business has to do all it can to convince customers that their product is better than the competition for whatever reason , that ’ s the art of Marketing . Coming up with the right products , setting the right prices , selling the product in the best and most convenient places ( having the product available for purchase ) , communicating the product to the public and convincing customers that your product is better then the competition is the art of selling .",0

"my pains can not disapear easily , what can i do ? Do you mean menstrual cramps ? It is called dysmennorhea . Google it and I 'm sure you will find alot of discussions . Ibuprofen , like Advil , is standard treatment . If you are normal sized , you can take maybe 3 Advil 4x/day for it .

Endometriosis , which is uterine lining -- -- endometrial tissue -- -growing where it do n't belong out in tube or in pelvis , can cause alot of dysmennorhea .

What I would recommend is going to www.webmd.com to show you the kind of behavior you are in for if you choose to stay ( which I would n't recommend , at least until he is stabilized ) Bi-polars without medication can stay up for days , even weeks and can reach a state of insomniatic psychosis where they can become violent to themselves or others . They can also slip into a deep depression where they ca n't find an reason to get out of bed , or complete the simplest task to take care of themselves . Suicide is in greater numbers among this psychological diagnoses . I would recommend slipping into more of a friendship role , because if you do n't you are in for the roller-coaster ride of your life .",0

"how to computer work ? Here 's the simple version : Computers haveA brain ( CPU or central processing unit ) Memory StoragePeripheralsThe CPU is like an air traffic controller controlling all your requests and running all your programs.The Memory holds the programs - including your OS ( windows etc . ) and data temporarily for the CPU to access.Storage such as a hard disk drive holds information when it is too large or inconvenient to place in memory and when the computer is shut down.Peripherals : Keyboard , mouse , monitor , printer are what the computer uses to interact with the Human.The CPU manages all your interactions : running programs , copying files , surfing the web . It uses the resources it needs ( peripherals , memory , storage etc . ) to fulfill those requests . Imagine you have a private chef , who is locked in his own kitchen . You make a request to him . He produces the food and uses his resources , pots , pans ingredients , recipes etc . He 's like your CPU.It goes much further than that , but I hope that helps .",0

"Can I buy lingerie for my wife for valentine 's day ?

Give it to her with a card and in the card instruct her to buy something sexy to wear on V-day ! A lot of lingerie looks better on the models ( and on the hanger ) than it will on a real woman . I bought lingerie for myself for Valentine 's day , and I must have tried on 10 things and the one I bought is the only one that really looked good .

"What is the easiest way to get a college degree on the net ? Is n't an easy way to do it , in fact , for some people it is more difficult to get an online degree than a traditional classroom based degree . You need a lot of self-discipline , high reading ability , and motivation to do a lot of learning on your own to do an online program . The only part of an online program that people view as `` easier '' is that you are n't necessarily tied down to a particular time of day to do your work . So , if you are a night owl you can do all your work at night , for example.That said , if you are interested in an online degree then you should seek a degree from a school that also has an established classroom based degree program . Recognize that many people still have a stigma toward internet degrees , so having a degree from an established college/university will lessen the stigma . Hope this helps .",0
"why is probability sampling prefered over non probability sampling ? Probabilty sampling allows you to perform stastistical analysis , such as regression , correlation and so on . They can also be crafted to be extremely representative of the population . You can also construct confidence intervals ( for example : 54 % of Americans support the bill with a margin of error of +/- 2 % ) . You can also use stastitical methods to prove casality or other relationships . Non probability sampling can not be used with stastical analysis , thus we can have no margin or error , correlation , etc . However , given a sufficiently large sample size , non probability sampling can still be useful for getting a 'pulse ' of the total population .",0

"I ve a very severe short sightedness which affects just an eye and doctors say glasses wo n't help . pls advice The doctor says the use of a glasses is out of the question since just one eye is affected and a thick lens according 2 him will affect d other eye and moreso i will ve a multiple vision Well , I do n't know the specifics of your problem , but I can offer a bit of an explanation of what your doctor said . Glasses would n't help you because the lenses for each eye would be dramatically different . Since you 're very near-sighted in the one eye , you would need a very strong lens that would ultimately make the image on your retina much smaller than the image on your other retina . If these two images are very different sizes , your brain ca n't put them together into one image and you see double . If both of your eyes can be corrected to 20/20 vision , I would ask your doctor ( or another doctor , if you 'd like a second opinion ) if LASIK is an option for you . This could possibly bring your very near-sighted eye close enough to the other eye so that your brain would be able to make a single image .",0
"Can a state to state relationship turn in to a life long relationship together. ? Yes , it can . It depends on how hard you work at it , and how much they are working at it . You have to keep your commitments of calling when you promise , being on line when you promise , of coming down when you promise , and vice versa . Sometimes starting out in long distance relationships actually make them better . One reason is that you know from the beginning it is going to take work and are ready to take that on . Second , you learn to communicate verbally with each other on every topic , and that will last through your relationship if it leads to marriage . Also , it forces you to take things slow , and really get to know the person over time . Sometimes if we can see the person every day , we fall too fast , and fail to recognize the warning signs that we would see if there were some distance put between us . I know of a couple that dated from Scotland to Canada for two years , and just got married . You know what ? They would n't have traded the past two years for anything , because now they talk to each other every day about everything , and it has taught them a lot about confiding in each other and trusting in each other . I hope it works out for you . : )",0

"Should Antonio Davis have jumped into the stands when he thought his wife was in danger ? I was listening to the radio this morning and there was a woman who says that women are always portrayed as needing `` help '' and that they do n't need the help of `` men '' and that they can defend themselves . And Antonio was wrong for going in to help his wife when she did n't even ask for his help . Was he wrong ? if he thought his wife was in danger , he acted properly . if my friends or girlfriend was in danger , i would act regardless of sex ( for friends , i mean ) , to ensure that they are safe . its not a sexist thing , its a husband/wife and friend thing . you look out for one another .",0

"Do any Jews live the Old Testament Laws ? Is there a 12 day period ever month of no sex for husband and wife. ? That is for wives that are pre-menopause . First , we dont call out Bible the 'Old Testament ' because we dont believe there is a new one.However , yes , the Orthodox Jewish community still follows the laws you describe above.By the way , this means that for roughly 2 weeks each month , a Jewish couple who follow this law will not have sex as an issue between them . It means that for half of each month , they must relate to each other as platonic friends , and this makes the relationship far stronger , and is one reason given for the very low divorce rate throughout the history of the Jewish People . Only since the Jews have assimilated , become like their non-Jewish neighbors , has the divorce rate risen to the same rate as among their non-Jewish counterparts , but continues to remain low among the orthodox .",0

The army 's needs come by transport provided by the navy . The maries are top notch , but should not be bogged down watching a city , which is best left to a larger force such as the army . The coast guard uses less power to guard the coasts against minor threats that should not trouble the billion dollar warships of the navy ( which burn alot of fuel ) . Special forces can perform operations but can not take over a city and hold it . Every force has its job to do , none is `` better '' than another .",0
"My 4th grade son is haveing MAJOR difficulties at school and I 'm considering homeschooling him.Any ideas ? I 'm having problems with the principal and I 've even talked to the superintendent . I do n't expect much help there but if they 're going to label my son as a `` troublemaker '' or someone who needs `` more counselling than just talking to a therapist '' ( the prinipal told me she thinks he should be `` institutionalized '' which the counsellor even disagrees with ) then I do n't see the point of putting him back into that situation . I live in a very small rural town with very limited counselling options which I am taking advantage of . I do n't have too many disciplinary problems with him at home but at school he 's been having `` meltdowns '' which have caused him to be suspended 2 times in the past 2 weeks plus a 5 day suspension for a comment he supposedly said . I ca n't move him to a nearby town 's school because they do n't accept kids after the start of the second semester . I just want him to pass 4th grade so he can go on to 5th grade with a different principal and hopefully a better prospect . HELP ! I went through a very similar situation and after months of being told by the teacher and the principal that there must be a problem at home , I found out another child was having the same problems mine was . The other mom and I got together and came up with a plan . We each got our child to tell us why the other child was having so much trouble.Turned out there was another child in the class bullying and intimidating ours so badly that there were days they spent all their time huddled under their desks . While I still could not get the school to admit to a problem , I did find a sympathetic vice principal who allowed my child access to her office at any time he felt he could not handle being in the class anymore . It was n't the perfect solution but it got us to the end of that school year and I made sure I had some say in what class he went into the next year . Things improved after that . If you truly are not having discipline problems at home and the only place there really seems to be a problem is at school , then I would be looking very hard at why there is a problem at school . Do n't take the teacher 's word for anything ... that teacher may very well be the problem . Talk to other parents and find out if anyone else is going through something similar to what you are . Make sure your child understands that you know there is a problem and you are doing your best to help . Let him know he has you on his side . Good luck . Sure would like to know the outcome of this one .",0

Learning to distinguish yourself from what you do can really help. # 2 : If someone criticizes you , think about how much you really care about their opinion . If they 're just some random person , why do you care what they think ? If you care about them , but they 're angry , they probably do n't mean it . # 3 : Take it in perspective . Just because you can improve on something does n't mean you 're not a great person. # 4 : Tell the person how you feel . Sometimes people do n't mean to be as harsh as they are , or assume that you 're not bothered .",0

"is buffy the vampire slayer postmodern ? if so why ? In a word , yes . The longer version is that BtVS is a piece of postmodern art because : '' In terms of popular culture and mass media , there has been a large push towards the postmodern tendency of `` bricolage , pastiche and intertextuality '' ( Altman , 1999:141 ) in recent years . In regards to BtVS , the series creator , Joss Whedon , has stated when he was forming the character of Buffy he thought of `` the little girl , the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed , in every horror movie . The idea of Buffy was to subvert that idea , that image , and create someone who was a hero where she had always been a victim . That element of surprise , that element of genre busting is very much at the heart of the series '' ( 2001 ) . The notion of `` genre busting '' is found in the postmodern mixing of horror , comedy and drama , and results in the playful deconstruction of genre conventions , forcing the audience to question their assumed knowledge of the 'rules ' of a particular genre , such as the formal repetitive structure of horror films ( Dika , 1987:87 ) '' Therefore , the primary reason why the show can be considered postmodern is that , from its very inception , the show was intended to flip and subvert the horror movie standard of the blonde girl being slain by the monster in the dark alley . BtVS also goes on to subvert standard readings of text and narrative by becoming extra-textual or outside of the text , by making transgressive allusions and references . Buffy 's postmodernism comprises not only self-awareness but also awareness of other shows , movies , books and anything else , including referring to Martha Stewart as a demon.Postmodernism also often defines itself by what it is not . In the case of Buffy , the show ( and its creator ) often defines itself by setting itself apart from something else . Thus , for instance , in Buffy many episodes , scenes or lines start with a cliché and then move on from it to subvert that cliché or exaggerate it in unconventional ways for dramatic purposes . This is demonstrated most clearly when a character questions a commonly used saying . For instance , in the season 2 episode , 'Lie to Me ' , Willow wonders why people say 'sticks out like a sore thumb ' : Xander : In no way do we stick out like sore thumbs . Willow : Okay , but do they really stick out ? Xander : What ? Willow : Sore thumbs . Do they stick out ? I mean , have you ever seen a thumb and gone , 'Wow ! That baby is sore ! ' Xander : You have too many thoughts.Another example is the show 's original conceit : the cliche that high school can be hell is given a postmodern twist by creating a show in which high school was literally on the mouth of hell .",0
"if a 16 year old is on probation , is n't she supposed to get off of it at the age of 17 ? Laws on probation and punishment of juveniles vary by state .

"why would a wife rather run with male friends than to spend time with her husband and family ? I have always worked hard and the jobs took me away from home alot . The last one I was mobilized to Iraq . Of which I was sent back home early due to a child custody problem . My wife had ( by power of attorney ) custody of my children from another woman . That woman showed up to the house and now I am here . Once all the military crap was completed and I was discharged from active duty , We had spoke about allof the above and she had stated that she felt confined . That she had no friends anymore . I tild her that she could go out with friends every once in awhile . That ended up to be every night m-th at a bar until it closed and f-sa at one ( a males ) house to play cards . For the most part I believe as such was going on , , , but now how can a male friend of hers who understands why I would chase after to find my wife and ask her to come home and not stay out all the time allow her to move in with him with our children.. ? ? ? It sounds like she has no respect for you and has no consideration for your feelings . Why would you want to be with a woman like this ? Would she be so understanding if you were spending your free time with another woman ? You need to take charge of the situation and put your foot down let her know that this is unacceptable behavior and if she refuses to put a stop to it you know that she is not the one for you . Ultimately the decision is yours do you want to live this way and if she is not looking out for your childrens best interest than maybe you need to .",0

Dear SellCar , i really hope you got a good reason behind those questions , anyways ill answer your question.i read some strange answer above ; ( , so i hope i can make it clear Ofcourse every woman hates polygamy , God created woman to hate anyone that shares her love , but in Holy Quran it says and made it clear for men that they should not take more than one wife unless they have their reasons , like for example some wives dont have the ability to be pregnant , its no body 's fault of course but as a man everyone likes to be a father , therefore he can marry another wife.another reason for men might be that some men need more than one woman and he is not getting enough , therefore he could make sin with other woman which is bad for Islam teachings and social life and reputation , or he can marry another woman that will give him more pleasure and in the same time he is not making any sin.Moreover , if you now make a study you will find that number of men is much more less than number of women in the world , years ago in Germany they where surprised to find that 1 man is being borned for every 4 women ! ! for a reason that no one knows except God he knew that this will be the case , therefore he authorised to have more than wife , or else we will have more than half of the woman not married for the rest of their lives . ( speaking about Islam societies only , western countires men and woman stays with no marriage usually for the rest of their lives ) God authorised polygamy for more better reasons ofcourse , but i only know these.and of course there is no polygamy for men in Islam ; ) , because at that stage we cant know who is son or daughter of whom.and for a man being with a legal woman is ofcourse much better than being with a new woman everyday or month ; ( Islam makes a great social life by its teachings.============i really dont know the exact age of Muhammad ( PBUH ) when he married Aisha , but i think in 40's.God didnt authorise for muslims to marry more than four wives and in a certain conditions , but for messenger of God ( Muhmmad PBUH ) he authorised for him to marry more , i do know one reason now for this is that Mohammad ( PBUH ) wanted to make links with the arab tribes across arabia to spread Islam , and as a messenger of God marrying one of the women in a tribe it was a very good impression to make for those tribes , which later he made friendship with them and they followed Islam teachings , therefore marrying more than one wife helped the spread of Islam at that time , and it made for Islam a good base in Arabia .",0

Around you find miraculous drugs and creams , different herbal products and at last some machine as like as the pump and the extensor ! Everyone sold those products on anonymous web sites and with high costs ! That ’ s just should be an alarm bell… eh ? Maybe the extensor ( only ! ) could give you a penis a bit longer ( but thinner ) after many times , BUT there are some implications . Aside of a flaccid penis , with the age it will be more difficult to have a strong erection after such treatment !

"Is there a recursive algorithm that generates all the permutations of a given string ? Here 's a java solution that uses recursion . The permute function takes two arguments : a done portion and a todo portion . The basic idea is that each of the characters in the todo portion could be the next character . So , at each step , n recursive calls are made , where n is the length of todo . Each call chooses a different character as the next character to go into the done portion . So , the first time the number of recursive calls will equal the number of characters in the initial string . Each of these calls will make further recursive calls equal to the number of characters in the initial string minus one . And so on . Thus , the number of solutions will be n ! = n*n-1*n-2* ... *1 , where n is the number of characters in the initial string.The program below was tested with java 's sun compiler 1.4.2.public class perm { public perm ( String S ) { permute ( `` '' , S ) ; } public void permute ( String done , String todo ) { if ( ( todo.length ( ) ==0 ) || ( todo.equals ( `` '' ) ) ) System.out.println ( done ) ; else { for ( int i=0 ; i < todo.length ( ) ; i++ ) { String c = todo.substring ( 0,1 ) ; todo = todo.substring ( 1 ) ; permute ( done+c , todo ) ; todo = todo + c ; } } } public static void main ( String args [ ] ) { if ( ( args.length==0 ) || ( args [ 0 ] .length ( ) ==0 ) || ( args [ 0 ] .equals ( `` '' ) ) ) return ; perm p = new perm ( args [ 0 ] ) ; } }",0

"What is the largest wave ever ridden by a surfer ? When , where and by whom ? I know Greg Noll had his pic taken on a wave 40+ feet high at Wiamea Bay . Since that famous shot was taken I have heard about places off Baja , possibly Todos Santos , which is accessible only by boat and jet skiis . Some of the surf there gets up to 65 feet . Could that be the place ? ? I do n't know . If you have any pictures or can provide a website where I can find this info it would be appreciated . Thanks ! ! It depends on what you define as `` riding a wave '' . There are `` tow-in '' sufers who rely on `` jetskis '' to tow them into waves . These waves are so large and travel so fast that it is impossible for a human-propelled board to match its speed . The traditionalist of the sport do not consider that truly `` surfing the wave '' . There is a contest that awards , both the surfer and photographer a monetary award if they can produce a picture proving they rode the biggest wave . I do know in the past that a prize was awarded to a team capturing a picture at Todos Santos . Peahi aka Jaws , off of Maui is arguably the largest waves ridden .

"whats happens with egg pressure and how much can it take how do i messure it ? mike ? how do i messure egg pressure how can u make it so that u can make the question a science fair topic The pressure within a chicken egg may be rather nominal , because eggs breathe without lungs . Oxygen is free to diffuse through the shell . Water is nearly incompressible , the effect even seven miles down at the bottom of the sea is nil . Gas is highly compressible and you have to halve the volume to double the pressure at constant temperature , per the perfect gas laws.Most boiled eggs are not perfectly ovalic because there is an air space within the shell . That air space would resist any increase in `` hydraulic '' pressure and excess gas should diffuse out of the shell.Of course a spoiled egg may build up pressure due to rapid decomposition and an egg shell would be fairly strong to retain it . Never microwave eggs because they may build up steam pressure and make a real mess . Early microwave machines had perforated plastic doors rather than solid glass and I recall one unhappy fellow who received a polkadot egg spattered shirt . Good luck .",0

"Has anyone heard of the `` sleep cure '' ? Supposedly it 's a means to lose a fair amount of weight over the course of a few days . You 're sedated and you wake up days later having lost 8-10 pounds . Real , or just some fictional fantasy that keeps cropping up in various books ? Sounds like some serious wishful thinking to me , combined with some misinterpreted observation.If you weigh yourself right before bed and then first thing in the morning , you will find that you 've lost a couple of pounds overnight . However , you 'll find by that evening that the weight is back.Makes it look like the best way to lose weight is to sleep , eh ? But it 's just water weight . You go to bed hydrated , you wake up dehydrated . Bummer.Sleeping for a few days may net you more weight loss , but some of that will be a loss in muscle ton , which will result in making it even harder to lose more weight and a good probability of gaining more weight than you lost.The best way to lose weight is to stop trying to lose weight . Instead , concentrate on improving your health . Yeah , yeah , exercise and eat right . * There 's a lot of details missing in those four words , but the gist is that any attempt to lose weight that does n't involve those activities are just ways of screwing your health for looks . The reason that I say stop trying to lose weight ?

"whats the verdict ? If I have tablet w/ voice output and I wrote something falsely accusing a person behind a sheet of cloth , the person heard my false accusation via voice generation . How would he/she sue me , slander or libel ? What Are Defamation , Libel and Slander ? Generally speaking , defamation is the issuance of a false statement about another person , which causes that person to suffer harm . Slander involves the making of defamatory statements by a transitory ( non-fixed ) representation , usually an oral ( spoken ) representation . Libel involves the making of defamatory statements in a printed or fixed medium , such as a magazine or newspaper . Typically , the elements of a cause of action for defamation include : A false and defamatory statement concerning another ; The unprivileged publication of the statement to a third party ( that is , somebody other than the person defamed by the statement ) ; If the defamatory matter is of public concern , fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher ; and Damage to the plaintiff . In the context of defamation law , a statement is `` published '' when it is made to the third party . That term does not mean that the statement has to be in print . Damages are typically to the reputation of the plaintiff , but depending upon the laws of the jurisdiction it may be enough to establish mental anguish . Most jurisdictions also recognize `` per se '' defamation , where the allegations are presumed to cause damage to the plaintiff . Typically , the following may consititute defamation per se : Attacks on a person 's professional character or standing ; Allegations that an unmarried person is unchaste ; Allegations that a person is infected with a sexually transmitted disease ; Allegations that the person has committed a crime of moral turpitude ; While actions for defamation have their roots in common law , most jurisdictions have now enacted statutes which modify the common law . They may change the elements of the cause of action , limit when an action may be filed , or modify the defenses to an action for defamation . Some may even require that the defendant be given an opportunity to apologize before the plaintiff can seek non-economic damages .",0

The college coach sees that the kid knows about the spread offense already so it would make him a better fit for that school then someone who knows nothing about it.Anyways , just my opinion , we ran the option in HS which I thought was fun but now there are only a couple college schools ( like Navy ) that run it anymore .",0

"Why did the German government introduce Submarine warfare ? NO SPAM PLZ ! I presume you mean `` unrestricted '' submarine warfare.The short answer was to win the war . A better answer was because the English blockade of of Germany had the effect of starving the German populace of both food and resources.During WW1 , the British Navy was the most powerful force in the world . The German surface Navy could not hope to be an effective counter to it , so Germany had to resort to tactics other than traditional surface conflict . Submarines or Unterseebooten ( U-Boats ) were one means employed by the Germans . U-Boats were the `` Stealth Bombers '' of thier day . They could sneak up on surface ships undetected , and sink them with torpedoes.Germany 's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was originally instituted to combat the overwhelming superiority of the English Navy , but when they started sinking un-armed vessels with other nations peoples on board ( specifically Americans ) this helped draw America into the war . When the American 's arrived , it tipped the balance in favor of the allies ultimately losing the war for Germany .",0

"Where is the gum ? I was told that my gum is healthy if I can see less than 4mm of it . But I thought the gum is the flesh connecting the teeth to the jaw , and I can see the entire pink flesh covering my teeth . There must be at least 1.5cm . How can it be less than 4mm ? Am I missing something ? The 4 mm probably refers to the depth of your gum pockets ( the space betwen the top of your gums to the alveolar bone that holds your teeth . Your dentist would measure this with a probe.If your pockets are deeper than 4 mm then it means that you have had bone loss which is usually caused by periodontal disease ( an infection in the gums ) . The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly ( brush at least twice a day for two minutes ) . I emphasize flossing , because often people do n't realize just how important it is . The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck , and therefore where bacteria sticks most often , too . The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch . So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth , you want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure you remove the plaque . So you should be going up and down two to three times along the tooth on both sides of the contact.Hope this helps !",0

"What is Raggaetone ? Reggaeton is a form of dance music which has become popular with Latin America in youth during the late 1990s and has spread to North American and European audiences during the first few years of the 21st century . Reggaeton ( also spelled with the Spanish accent as Reggaetón , and sometimes as Reguetón in Spanish ) - blends Jamaican music influences of reggae and dancehall with those of Latin America , such as bomba and plena , as well as that of hip hop . The music is combined with rapping ( generally ) in Spanish . Reggaeton has empowered the Spanish Caribbean youth , specifically those of Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic , as well as the Latin American and United States Latino communities , with a musical genre as a voice . More recently it has become an international movement with the help of many from New York 's Latino and Black hip hop community.While it takes influences from hip hop and dancehall , it would be wrong to define reggaeton as the 'Spanish'- or 'Latino'- version of either of these genres ; reggaeton has its own specific beat and rhythm , whereas Latino hip hop is simply hip hop sung by artists of Latino descent . Reggaeton 's distinguishing feature is the Dem Bow beat ( alternately spelled Dembow ) , which originated in a song by Shabba Ranks in the mid-1990s.Reggaeton lyrics tend to be more derived from hip hop than dancehall . Like hip hop , reggaeton has caused controversy due to its often explicit lyrics and alleged exploitation of women [ 1 ] . Further controversy surrounds perreo , a dance with explicit sexual overtones which typically accompanies reggaeton music",0

"What is a great natural small venue for an elopement - just bride , groom , minister and witnesses ? Want to get married in Seattle on August 27 while we are vacationing there .

I 've looked at several venues , but they are all for actual weddings with guests , caterers , etc . All I want is photographer to take some pics , a great bouquet and place to go after for dinner/dancing/partying . Any suggestions ? We are outdoorsy , artsy , not formal , dress and rings are vintage , prefer natural/historical/unusual setting to make it memorable and seems like we should n't have to pay to rent a venue as we have no guests . Suggestions/comments welcome ! What about a bed and breakfast ? If you are staying there while vacationing than I would see no reason for them to say no . It would probably be good for business too , if you gave them a picture to use in a brochure . Or you could try a Seattle park , I 'm not sure about the fees , since it is such a small wedding , you might not even need a permit . Calling the scheduling office could n't hurt . Hope it helps .

"What is a slider ? What is the tragectory of a slider , and how is it different from a curveball ? How is a slider typically thrown ? In baseball , a slider ( also known as a `` nickel curve '' ) is a pitch halfway between a curveball and a fastball , with less break but more speed than the curve . It will tend to drop less and move toward or away from the batter more than a curve . The extra speed can fool the hitter into thinking it is a fastball , until too late . Some pitchers also use a cut fastball ( or cutter ) which is one step closer than the slider to the fastball on the spectrum between fastballs and curves . A pitch that has movement similar to both a slider and a curveball is sometimes called a slurve.In addition , the term 'slider ' often refers to mini hamburgers , such as those at White Castle or often served at pubs .",0

"my mother has fibromyalgia , anyone have ideas on treatments ? she currently uses heat and pain pills I have had Fibro since I was 16 and am now almost 36 . I have seen more doctors over the years than I can count from Neurologists to Rhuematologists to Chiropractors to Psychiatrists to Pain Specialists . In my experience pain medications do not work . A muscle relaxant is much more helpful . I have also tried biofeedback , steroid shots , trigger point injections , two sleep studies , nerve blocks , accupuncture , foot braces , wrist braces , carpal tunnel release surguries , and so much more . All just torture and I felt like a guinea pig.My best advise is make sure to get plenty of sleep , take a multiple vitamin , keep active in at least low impact sports , and consider Magnesium and Malic Acid supplements ( consult the doctor or a nutritionist to have her Magnesuim level checked- it is a simpe mouth swab and not painful ) , meditation does help some in keeping the pain back if you can seperate your mind from the pain , and try to take 2-3 warm Epson Salt baths a week ( Epson salt contains Magnesium and soaking in a warm tub of it helps to get the mineral into the body . Magnesium aids the muscles in using oxygen and when the level is low which is typical in Fibro it can cause are cramps , spasms , and pain . ) Also , Fibromyalgia is a neurotransmitter disorder and certain foods can trigger similiar symptoms to Fibro . Try to have her eliminate Monsodium Glutamate from her diet . I did and some of my symptoms ( chronic headaches and nausea ) went away . It is in everything from Doritos to chicken soup .

What is the difference between high color & true color of a computer ? It is based on the amount of computer and graphics card resources devoted to making the details of the picture on your screen . High color is a little less detailed ( using less colors ) than true color.You should use the lowest setting you are pleased with . Using higher settings will tax your graphics card and cpu more-not a problem if you have the latest real great system but for most people it is not necessary to have graphics better than they can even notice . The computer resources that you save could be devoted to other functions in the machine . People who play certain games or people who do extrememly detailed graphics work may claim to notice slight differences between the highest settings but most people never do.I like to have as high of a refresh rate as my monitor will allow . 85 is a good number-easy on the eyes . Usually the higher refresh rates will require lower color and resolution settings to balance out the limitations of the graphics card .,0

"What do you think of President Bush sellin our ports to Arabs ? Update : `` He became aware of it over the last several days , '' McClellan said . Asked if Bush did not know about it until it was a done deal , McClellan said , `` That 's correct . `` First of all , I just want to say that it 's obvious not `` all Arabs are terrorists '' and objection to this port deal is not suggesting in the least bit that they are . You see a lot of the educated Congressmen , of both parties , objecting to the sale of these ports to a UAE company . These are intelligent , educated people and you think that they are objecting to this deal because they believe that all Arabs are terrorists ? I think not . The first perons who answered this question is the one who needs to get educated.It is justifiable to say that giving control of these major US ports to a company in the UAE poses a threat to national security . This situation is comparable to the notion of `` probable cause . '' If a police officer sees a person driving dangerously and erratically he has reason to believe that this person might be intoxicated . If two of the September 11 hijackers came from the UAE and money used to fund those attacks went through UAE banks , we have reason to believe that giving control of major ports to a UAE company is an added threat to security.There is no argument against the fact the UAE is located in a region of the world where anti-Western sentiment is strong . UAE control of these ports gives people a greater opportunity to act of these feelings.Sorry to say , but there is a difference between a British company operating these ports and a UAE company operating these ports . I am a strong supporter of President Bush on 95 % of the issues , but I do not know where his head is regarding this issue , if he really did know about this before the deal was made .",0

"when will the iraqi dinar gain in value ? In about 20 years when the country is finally able to start producing more oil than they are consuming . The value of the dinar is also dependent on many other things , like the actions of the Central Bank of Iraq . At present it has essentially a fixed value of 1477 dinars to the dollar . This value is being held fixed because all of the contractors working in Iraq need a stable exchange rate in order to operate . The value has not fluctuated by more than 1 % since the exchange began operating a couple of years ago . The Iraqi dinar probably has as much potential to lose value when it is finally traded on the open market as it does to rise . The Iraq economy will be oil-export dependent and at present Iraq is not producing as much oil as it was before the war . In fact much of the oil Iraq is presently exporting is being offset by imports of refined products like diesel and gasoline . Because oil production can not be increased under the present unstable conditions , it may be decades before Iraq becomes a significant oil exporter . Many of the wells in Iraq were permanently damaged by being shut down for the war . These wells will have to be redrilled or repaired and at present this is almost impossible . An oil rig makes a very vulnerable target and no oil company is going to risk its workers and assets on something that will become a target for bombers and snipers . It often takes years of planning to prepare for drilling an oil well , and then can take months or years to develop a new discovery . It could easily be 5 or 10 years before Iraq sees new oil production even it it starts tomorrow , and it wo n't . If you bought dinars I suggest you frame them and hang them on the wall .

"Why does society feel that they have the right to impose their opinion on others ? When an issue is one where there will be no viable consequence to society but is of a completly personal nature . ie abortion , religion , etc ... Why do people feel they have the right to force others to live the way they 've chosen instead of leaving these issues up to the person who will be affected by their choice . Abortion and religious decisions should absolutely be made only by yourself only . You are absolutely right how people try to impose their beliefs onto others . For example , most people believe that everyone should believe in god and go to church , but if there is someone who does n't feel this way , you think since most people feel the other way that it is wrong . You know what , i am an aetheist , and if someone thinks i 'm an idiot because of this , Screw you ! ! ! I do n't care what society as a whole really thinks . It 's just like trying to fit in when your in highschool , all of the cool kids where the cool clothes , if you do n't your the freak , and i would just like to yell at everyone who has ever done this to someone . What the hell makes you so special that you can call someone a freak because they do n't where the same clothes , or because they do n't like sports , SCREW YOU ! ! ! ! ! ! Someone said you are obviously still young and on marijuana , that is such a stupid sterotype , you are obviously old and you are probably one of those people who think that everyone should go to church and if you do n't your a rebel freak.What the hell do you care if someone has an abortion anyway most likely you do n't even know anyone who has had an abortion , and if the parent really believes that life wil be better for the kid and herself then who the hell are you to say that it would n't be ? how the hell would you know ? ? ? ? I 'm Sick of everyone 's do what society does crap . Your the ones who are going to hell ...",0

"How many `` gifts '' of the spirit are there ? And what are they ! Can anyone tell me ? Alot of people have different views on this topic !

The Bible also says every good thing comes from God . So a spiritual gift is any good thing a person can have ( All we have is given to us by God ) . So that can include talents , skills and other blessings . For example a person with musical talent has a gift of music , a being good with children would also be a gift . God gives us all kinds of gifts and they can all be used for His glory if we allow them to . vs. 12-31 goes on to talk about these gifts . Any gift can apply here .",0

The person who brings it to light is called the relator , who with the help of an attorney files a lawsuit that is not public information ( under seal ) .

"When buying DVD Movies , what is the difference between full frame and wide screen movies ? The difference is due to something called `` aspect ratio '' . Widescreen movies have a 16:9 aspect ratio , meaning that they are more rectangular than square in the shape of the screen ( the screen is wider than regular , hence the term `` widescreen '' ) . The difference in the picture is that with widescreen , you see more on the edges of the picture . For instance , if there were 100 trees in a shot , with full frame you might only see 70 of them because the edges are cut off a bit . To me , this makes a difference in the movie , but not so much that you would have a different understanding of the film . Moving forward , I would say that you should buy your movies in 16:9 or widescreen format because more and more TV 's are now in that format .",0

"If jesus is Lord / God when he died on the cross who kept the universe in order ? Is the trinity false ? Excellent question . But unfortunately , I have yet to hear a good answer . God the Almighty Creator does n't even blink for a second , nonetheless die . If this were true and God died on the cross , then ALL existance would cease.Here 's what makes the trinity questionable : If you have a creature ( i.e . a created being ) , and a third of that creature dies while the other two-thirds are still alive , then that creature has n't really died . All parts would have to die for the creature to be considered dead . So if this applies to a created being , how can it not apply to the Creator ? If a third of God dies , but the other two-thirds are still alive , then that third did n't really die ; especially when he 's resurrected within a number of hours.The fact is that death in itself is a creation . Therefore the dimension of death can not be applied to an infinite entity which exists outside the realm of all creation . i.e . No creator , or any part of a creator , dies.What does that mean anyways ? What does it mean that a third of God has died ? ? ? This can only indicate that the trinity is not true ; it 's merely a pagan practice that has filtered down to blemish the noble message of Prophet Jesus ( peace be upon him ) . ( see link below ) For those who say angels , well who was sustaining the angels in God 's absence ? Did you really hear yourself say that ? ?",0

The whiteness of clouds is due to the tiny particles of water that make them up refracting the sunlight that enters them to make it appear brighter as it comes out .

"how to increase self-esteem or confidence if you have acne scars and your classmates do n't have ? can you help me ? First recognize its not your fault . Its what makes you unique . You 're not sub-par , or defective , or less than others because you do n't have smooth flawless skin . You are different , but just as good . You still are beautiful/attractive . And others will think so too.Be happy . Have a pretty smile . Walk with confidence , knowing that you are beautiful/attractive . Focus on making others feel good about themselves . That 's really attractive . Walk with your head high . Shoulders back . Look at others in their eyes . Speak loud and clear . Smile often . Fake confidence until you feel it . At the same time , take good care of yourself , so that you can be your very best . Eat right . Drink plenty of water . Take vitamins . Get 8 hours sleep . Determine allergens , and eliminate them . ( I was seriously allergic to bleach , and it cause huge breakouts on my face ) Be proactive in treating your problems . Try products to help acne scars . ProActiv is very good on acne . But is you have deep scars , you need to resurface your skin . Try Obagi products . They work so well . You have to get them from a doctor or cosmetic surgen , and they are expensive , ( about $ 300 for about 3 months worth of supplies , after the initial kit , you just replace what you need at about $ 45 a month ) , but you 'll see beautiful skin . If you still feel down about yourself , try a bottle of the herb St. John 's Wort . You can buy it at Walmart . Its a mood elevator . It raises your melatonin and seratin levels and makes you feel better , so you can focus on the important things . Non-adddictive , and safe to use . Then do something that makes you feel proud of yourself . Stop doing things that you know are wrong . Set high goals . Volunteer . Teach a Sunday School class . Tutor children to read . Be nice to your family . Do other things to make you feel good about yourself . Your self esteem should be based on who you ARE and what you give to society . You want to look your best , and it makes you feel good , but your looks should NOT be the foundation of your self-esteem . How shallow is that ? And lastly , realize it could be a whole lot worse .

"who is the presedent of canada ? No one . We do not have Presidents ( thank God ) . The official head of state of Canada is the Governor General ( Her Excellency the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean ) , who represents our Queen , Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.The Governor General takes the advice of the Prime Minister who is currently Stephen Harper.To echo a comment that someone made , we do have a very good system of government here . It is based on the Parliament system style of government used in the United Kingdom.The previous government lost a `` vote of confidence '' , and when this happens we normally hold an election . This only happened because we had a minority Liberal government . When the Gomery Report came out , the opposition parties ganged up and voted against the minority government.If you have a majority government , you 're stuck with the government until at most 5 years . But we usually have elections every 4 years.One thing we normally have more open politics here because of the parliamentary style of government . The leader of the opposition maintains a fairly good check on the actions of the ruling government . Our news is mainly revolving around the government and the goings on with politics and not sensational shootings and murder , so we also keep a sharp eye on our politicians.If you 're interested in learning more about my country and our style of government , please visit http : //www.canada.gc.ca/",0

"sri lankan histore ? The Sinhalese arrived in Sri Lanka late in the 6th century B.C. , probably from northern India . Buddhism was introduced beginning in about the mid-third century B.C. , and a great civilization developed at the cities of Anuradhapura ( kingdom from circa 200 B.C . to circa A.D. 1000 ) and Polonnaruwa ( from about 1070 to 1200 ) . In the 14th century , a south Indian dynasty seized power in the north and established a Tamil kingdom . Occupied by the Portuguese in the 16th century and by the Dutch in the 17th century , the island was ceded to the British in 1796 , became a crown colony in 1802 , and was united under British rule by 1815 . As Ceylon , it became independent in 1948 ; its name was changed to Sri Lanka in 1972 . Tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil separatists erupted into war in 1983 . Tens of thousands have died in an ethnic conflict that continues to fester .

"what causes dry mouth ? People get dry mouth when the glands in the mouth that make saliva are not working properly . Because of this , there might not be enough saliva to keep your mouth wet . There are several reasons why these glands ( called salivary glands ) might not work right.Some common causes of dry mouth are : * Side effects of some medicines . More than 400 medicines can cause the salivary glands to make less saliva . Medicines for high blood pressure and depression often cause dry mouth . * Disease . Some diseases affect the salivary glands . Sjögren 's Syndrome , HIV/AIDS , diabetes , and Parkinson 's disease can all cause dry mouth . * Radiation therapy . The salivary glands can be damaged if they are exposed to radiation during cancer treatment . * Chemotherapy . Drugs used to treat cancer can make saliva thicker , causing the mouth to feel dry . * Nerve damage . Injury to the head or neck can damage the nerves that tell salivary glands to make saliva .",0

"Do you think all the crying and lack of support for our present president is exactly what terrorists want ? Does n't matter . Who the president is or what we , as Americans , think about our president has no bearing on what the terrists do or want.Terrorists are fanatics . Our side has its own fanatics . Fanatics do not want to be bothered with complications like what others think about them or anything else . They do what they do , like automatic machines made of flesh and blood . Their lives are simple , free of any doubts . They know and fully believe that they are right and moral and those against them are wrong and evil.We should be lucky that George is not still circling Idaho asking if it is okay to land yet .",0

"What are the elements of tragedy found in John Steinbeck 's work ? i have to do a research paper and i ca n't figure out what John Steinbeck uses for his elements of tragedy ( in the books , The Pearl ... The Grapes of Wrath ... Of Mice and Men and ... Cannery Row The Pearl : Kino finds the pearl in answer to his prayer to help heal Coyotito 's scorpion sting , and in Kino 's frenzy to keep the pearl and survive , he ends up killing Coyotito.The Grapes of Wrath : Rose of Sharon 's ( Rosasharn 's ) baby , the hope of the future through the whole book , who is to be the firstborn of a new generation in California where the family hopes to find steady work rather than the same unlivable drudgery they have in Oklahoma , is stillborn because the Joads could not escape that poverty.Of Mice and Men : Because of the harshness of the life of itinerant farmworkers , Lennie does not recieve the help and comfort he needs , and accidentally kills Curly 's wife . Thus , George is forced to kill Lennie , the person he swore he 'd protect . Cannery Row : Mack and the boys work to throw a party for Doc , but when Doc does n't arrive , the party gets out of hand and Doc 's home , laboratory , and possessions are destroyed . Also : Frankie 's love for Doc , the only person who ever showed him any kind of nice treatment , becomes his downfall when Frankie steals a $ 75 clock for Doc and is arrested and sent to an institution.Also : the tale of the first bouncer at the Bear Flag Restaurant , who killed himself when he believed that no one loved him , after he took whiskey to Mack and the boys and they still would n't accept him into their group.There are more tragic elements in all these books . Just note everywhere that somebody tries to do something nice , or tries to better themselves , and it goes wrong .",0

Ways to deal with it : Be your own person . There is a friend for every type of person in this world .

"who is better clinton or bush ? INCLUDED SPECIFIC DETAILS AND HIGH LIGHTS OF THIER CAREERS While EVERYONE will say Clinton ( there 's a strong wave of anti-Bush-ism ) both have their flaws.CLINTON -Did nothing over terrorist attacks on America . -The WTC was bombed before Sep. 11 . -U.S. Embasies were bombed -The USS Cole was bombed ( all by Bin Laden ) Commited Purgery ( a very impeachable offense ) BUSH - -Went overboard on 'war on terror ' in attacking Iraq . ( opinion ) -Economy has been down for quite some time -Is much less liked internationally ( and domestically too ) They 've both done good things , I think too.CLINTON - -Economy flurished -US well respected in worldBUSH - -Willing to do what it takes to keep America safe . ( By attacking Afghanistan , something Clinton would n't do with previous attacks . ) -Has GREATLY increased free trade in the western hemisphere ( although there are some farmers in Mexico and other S.American places that say free trade hurts them . ) Overall , I think that both presidents did the best they could and that their actions ( especially Bush 's ) are more of a response to circumstances outside their control . I do n't think , for example , ( and many do ) that Bush intended to go to war when he was elected . I do n't think that Clinton thought he was lying . ( I think he thought he used clever words to hide what he actually did . He used the word 'sexual relations ' which he interpreted to mean 'sexual intercorce ' and he only had oral sex . ) So either way , I do n't think that either president has really hurt or help America in any appreciable way . ( that the other would n't have . )",0
"Which is better , AMD or Intel ? I know for a fact that AMD is much better than Intel ! AMD 's processors run a lot faster and cooler . A cooler running processor is important . Not only does it mean that AMD processors have a faster clock speed than comparable Intel products but AMDs also have a longer life expectancy as well . Plus AMD costs quite a bit less than their Intel counterparts . AMD is also ahead on the technology curve as well . They were the first company to introduce the 64-bit PC processor many months ahead of Intel ’ s 64-bit processor . This is why I believe that AMD will possibly out live Intel.I 've had both brands and nobody can even come close AMD ’ s speed and power ! I am running a newer AMD Sempron 3000+ with 512 MB of memory and Windows 2000 Professional SP4 for my operating system and this combination works great.From now on AMD , is the only processor for me . This is just my honest opinion . And no , I do not work for or get any gratuity from AMD for saying this .",0
"Who supports these liars in the White House ? Do you remember Lawrence Lindsey ? He was one of King George ’ s II economic policy advisor 's and Director of the National Economic Council from 2001 to 2002 . He was fired in 2002 after suggesting that the Iraq War would cost upwards of $ 200 billion . The official administration propaganda at the time said the war would cost $ 60 billion . They also said we would be greeted as liberators and showered with flowers.Mr . Lindsey was wrong . Congress has already appropriated $ 357 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan . Remember , these cost are on top of the $ 400+ billion a year we already spend on defense.It gets worse . According to a new economic study by Joseph Stiglitz , a former Chief Economist of the World Bank and a Nobel Prize winner in economics , the future cost of our current war/occupation will be between $ 1 trillion to $ 2 trillion.This nation spent $ 800 billion adjusted for inflation to fight the war in Vietnam . However this isn ’ t the true cost of a war . An additional $ 1 trillion was spent on Veterans benefits and interest payments after the war.What does this mean to you and your family ? It comes out to be about $ 19,600 per U.S. Household . That would have been enough to finance the shortfall in Social Security for 150 to 300 years . NO ! ! ! This is the same evidence I have used in recent months for reasons NOT to support the Iraq War . It gets worse friend.It seems that America 's continued interest in Iraq may have sparked a civil war for the `` democratic '' powers of the Iraq country . Now , America must spend billions more in building a better Iraqi military to avert any new war . This event continues to return again and again for the US.Let 's recall:1 ) The rebellion of US military forces in Mexico during the early 20th century.2 ) The resistance of American diplomacy in the Phillipines in 1898 . ( Imperialism ) 3 ) The disaster in Vietnam during the Nixon administration.The results always ends with American taxpayers paying for the problems that a Republican administration makes and the Democratic Party 's occupancy in the White House . Somehow ( probably in 2009 ) America will once again fix the problems that are prevalent now . But , our next problem will be Venezuela as it continues to be a nuissance to our sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere . Just call this the Neverending Story .",0

"What will I have to pay in taxes on an annuity when I withdraw money at age 62 ? Annuities are investments . The portion of your withdrawal that represents your initial investment is withdrawn tax-free . All the earnings on your investment are taxed as ordinary income .

And now the annuity is worth $ 500,000 . The original $ 100,000 is returned to you tax-free , and the remaining $ 400,000 is taxable income . Annuities are designed to provide you income for life , and so you will be spreading your tax-free withdrawals over the entire period of your withdrawals.Spending an hour or so with a CPA should help you plan your retirement so that you minimize your taxes.All the best , William Pereztaxes.about.com",0

I think there is a lot of awareness that there is a thing called autism . But people are woefully ignorant of what autism is like . I know I 've mentioned that my niece has autism & people have said things like `` Have you ever taken her to Las Vegas ? '' Then I have to explain that `` Rain Man '' was FICTION ! Even though the character was inspired by some real people , Hollywood got a hold of the script & had to exsagerate . And `` Autism '' can mean so many things , too . One of the questions here included a description of `` geeks watching Star Trek '' as autism . I guess they were refering to Aspergers . When I hear people saying things like `` Autism does n't need treatment or a cure '' I ca n't help but think they must be refering to Aspergers.Then there 's strict autsim . My brother would keep his baseball mitt mearby for when his daughter would have fits . He 'd use it to `` catch '' her head as she was trying to bang it on tables , walls , or the floor . Thankfully , she does n't do that anymore & she 's finally out of diapers ( at age 8 ) but hardly has any words . She can understand a lot , but ca n't color in the lines , much less , write !

"why do people generally get discusted with gay men but excited w/ the thought of two women ? About half of the guys I know are homophobic . One of my homophobic friends would say stuff like , “ I don ’ t have a problem with gay guys . I just don ’ t want them … around me , ” and “ Gay guys just wan na plunder my a*s. ” It ’ s so common for hetero guys to think that all gay guys wan na do is rape hetero guys . By definition , a phobia is an irrational fear . What ’ s to be afraid of ? Their scathing humor aside , homosexual men are the most harmless things on Earth . Have you ever heard of a gay murderer ? Or a gay thief ? Maybe I haven ’ t been around long enough , but I ’ ve never heard of a criminally deviant homo dude ( although I do know some pretty ghetto dyke hooligans ) . My point is I think most homophobic guys can ’ t explain why they ’ re scared of gay guys.What I think the reason is : The penis is the intrusive genital . Men brandish their penii with a subconscious feeling of superiority over women . And the idea that a man will use that power against his own kind repulses hetero men . Hetero guys like an*l sex ( with a female ) , not because it feels better , but because it shows ownership of the woman he ’ s sodomizing . The notion that they may be owned in the same way scares them.This is not necessarily fact . Just my take on the matter . Hey , I ’ m not man-hating . I ’ m just homo-defending.Guys , you should take it up the a*s every once in a while . Your g-spot is located next to your prostate , accessible only through the butth*le . I ’ m not suggesting having your butt plugged by another guy . If you ’ re not down for that , let your girlfriend hit it with a d*ldo . Don ’ t knock it ‘ til you try it .

On the one hand you have all these supposed justifications for the reasons we are there but they just contradict the reasons we are really there.If the current adminstration and the administration before it , for that matter , was so concerned about humanitarian issues , I do not see why we were not in the Congo or other REAL hotspots in the world with our `` Shock and Awe '' show of force . There are places all over the globe we can be and can really help . Unfortunately , unless there is some way to profit from those areas ( OIL ) , we will not do anything about those problems .",0
"Does a 500 doller bill exist ? And where can I get my hands on it ? You can find them on eBay , but they cost more than $ 500.00.-CoryOn July 14 , 1969 , David M. Kennedy , the 60th Secretary of the Treasury , and officials at the Federal Reserve Board announced that they would immediately stop distributing currency in denominations of $ 500 , $ 1,000 , $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 . Production of these denominations stopped during World War II . Their main purpose was for bank transfer payments . With the arrival of more secure transfer technologies , however , they were no longer needed for that purpose . While these notes are legal tender and may still be found in circulation today , the Federal Reserve Banks remove them from circulation and destroy them as they are received .",0

The infection went away on the first day and the fever went down , but she 's having hearing trouble . Any advice ? Give it time . With an ear infection you usually have some fluid build up behind the eardrum . Even if the fever is gone , the fluid ( and the bacteria in it ) can still be there . So the hearing should improve as the fluid goes away and make sure your daughter finishes the full course of the Amoxicillin , or the bacteria in the fluid can start multiplying again and she can end up even sicker than before .

"Why ca n't we get an acceptable Communications Decency Act and Child Pornography Prevention Act ? First Amendment jurisprduence tightly restricts Congress from enacting such regulations . The Supreme Court has articulated a test in a case called Miller , which states that obscenity is unprotected , but requires it to meet three qualifications : First , the average person , applying community standards , considering the work as a whole , finds that the work appeals to the prurient interest ; second , the work is a patently offensive depiction , applying community standards , of sexual conduct , as defined specifically by law ; and third , as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . That 's a lot of burdens for Congress to reach , and it often includes too much protected speech when trying to identify obscenity.The Court allowed restrictions on child pornography , too , in Ferber , so long as the work , first , visually depicts minors , who , second , are engaged in sexual acts lewdly exhibiting their genitals . The Court later interpreted this prohibition as only concerned with the well-being of children in the creation of pornography , not the fostering of child molesters , and so virtual child pornography was found protected , so long as no children were actually harmed.It seems like the Supreme Court is currently protecting a lot under the First Amendment , even things that seems pretty dangerous or pretty valueless . Congress will have its work cut out to try to pass better regulations that can pass the Court 's scrutiny .",0

"Would you ever want to attend the Super Bowl ? Why or why not ? I most likely would never want to attend the Super Bowl for three reasons . First , the cost . The cost of one Super Bowl ticket is expensive and with the money that I could pay for one Super Bowl ticket , I could purchase a High Definition Television . Second , I would have to deal with a lot of crowds at the event . Although it would be a dream to attend the Major League Baseball All-Star Game but with the Super Bowl , you have to get to the game early and there is going to be more people attending a Super Bowl than a baseball All-Star Game . Finally , it might be more expensive to attend at Super Bowl after you pay for accommodations for about three day and attending all the Super Bowl events that the host city has to offer . If I ever did want to attend the Super Bowl , I would like to see the Super Bowl in Detroit , Atlanta , Chicago , and in Cleveland . Yes if the Redskins were in it .",0
"What the meaning of `` CALIFORNIA `` ? In the greek language `` CALI `` means `` NICE `` Some suggest that the word California may signify that a place is `` hot as an oven '' ( cali > hot , fornia > oven ) . It may be derived from caliente fornalia , Spanish for hot furnace , or it may come from calida fornax , Latin for hot climate.Another possible source may be kali forno , an indigenous phrase meaning `` high mountains '' . There is no agreement among scholars.The name California comes from a mythical Spanish island ruled by a queen called Califia that was featured in a Spanish romance ( `` Las Sergas de Esplandian '' ) written by Garcia Ordonez de Montalvo in 1510 . The Spanish explorers originally thought that California was an island .",0

"What features did a medieval castle have ? Stone , mortar , wood-these were the simple components used to construct some of the most heavily fortified structures ever created.Early castles relied on the surrounding landscape to provide much of the protection . Early castles were made of wood and built on hills of `` mottes '' . Surrounded by a high , wooden palisade , motte and bailey castles were used widely until the Norman invasion of 1066 . These fortifications proved too easy to burn , and stone was then used more frequently.Castles were rarely the most comfortable place to live , with only the lord and his family given adequate heat and other amenities . Medieval castles were built for safety , not comfort . Windows were little more than slits in the wall . Cold , stone floors and walls rarely kept in heat , and water had to be brought by the bucketful throughout the castle . Walls were built high to protect from advancing armies , and to provide needed lookout positions.For detailed information , visit : http : //www.medieval-castles.net/castle_architecture/index.htmThe simple stone and mortar architecture made repairs fairly easy to make . It was not uncommon for stones to be used over and over with each successive castle built on the same location . Cannons and gunpowder made the castle ineffective and these large structures evolved in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance to become manor homes and palaces .",0

"Why do prisoners get to `` plea bargain '' for the crimes they chose to commit ? The way I see it , a woman does not get to say , `` Look , I really do not want to be raped , so can you just fondle me ? '' The clerk at the grocery store who is being robbed does n't get to say , `` I do n't feel like getting a serious injury or dying right now , so instead of shooting me in the chest or head , can you just shoot me in the leg ? `` So why do the criminals get to `` bargain '' and get to have the charges for the crime they committed made to be less than what they actually did ? It 's a very provocative question with a very mundane answer . I do n't think it 's fair either , but prosecutors sometimes need information about someone further up the line . If a rapist , for instance , also works with and has knowledge of a white slavery ring and can give credible testimony that will put the leaders and their underlings in jail a prosecutor may offer a lighter sentence in order to stop a larger criminal enterprise.The other reasons are more disturbing . Sometimes a prosecutor 's office is so overloaded that accepting a plea bargain is a way to make a dent in the case load that the office is carrying . Ideally , that would only occur with non-violent , first time offenders , but sadly that is not always the case.Finally , some victims are reluctant to testify or are so traumatized by the crime committed against them that they are unable to testify well and the D.A . 's office does n't want to risk an acquital . In this same vein are cases that can mount a credible reasonable doubt defense and cases where the evidence is weak or tainted.It a'int perfect , but its a better system than most others .",0

"Who is Prophet Muhammad ? Muhammad ( , also transliterated Mohammad , Mohammed , Muhammed , and formerly Mahomet , following the Latin ) was an Arab religious and political leader and the final prophet of Islam . Islam is considered by Muslims to have existed prior to Muhammad , in the same tradition as Judaism and Christianity . Non-Muslims consider him the founder of Islam . According to traditional Muslim biographers , he was born c. 570 in Mecca ( Makkah ) and died June 8 , 632 in Medina ( Madinah ) ; both Mecca and Medina are cities in the Arabian Peninsula . Because of his success in spreading the final word of Islam and being successful both politically and on many other levels , Muhammad is considered to be one of the most influential people of all time.____For more information go to the website below .",0

"Should Edgar Martinez ( retired Seattle Mariners DH ) be inducted into the Hall of Fame ? Edgar deserves to be in the Hall of Fame , he is the best DH every and a mentor to the younger players .

"what does `` nobody can make you feel infrior without your permission '' mean ? what does `` nobody can make you feel inferior without your permission '' mean ? No one can MAKE you feel anything ( except physical pain of course ) . If you 're a professional dancer and some accountant who knows nothing about dance tells you you 're terrible , you 'll dismiss it because you do n't value his opinion . But if an accomplished dancer who you respect says the same thing it might make you actually question your talents , and feel inferior . In this case you would have given the dancer , but not the accountant , permission to make to make you feel inferior.But of course it might turn out that the dancer is old and bitter and wants to squash your potential by attacking your confidence . The key is to develop a solid sense of who you are - both your strengths and weaknesses . If someone attacks something you know is a strength , it should n't bother you . And if they attack something you know is a weakness - that really should n't bother you either because you 've accepted that this particular aspect is not your strongest .",0

"How can I figure out what I want to do with my life ? I 'm not in school because I 'm scared I wo n't finish because I 'll get disinterested . Any advice on what to do ? Same problem..so I hear ya . I also however , do n't have the determination to get in there do my thing in school and finish it out . The best thing I did as an eye opener was make an appointment to talk to one of the counselors at the school . They did assessments with me , and tests to see what I was good at and in and what I would do awful to be in . This narrowed out things..and brought things to light that I probably should n't do when I actually considered or tried them before ( no wonder they did n't work ) .

"When is the best time to go to disney world ? This is my response to a similar question : This depends on what you are looking for as far as the best time . Christmas time is one of the most beautiful times of the year . Each resort is decorated for Christmas and the decorations are beautiful . If you go during this time you have to visit the resorts . They have a carousel made out of chocolate , a a very large gingerbread house and other amazing things . Plus , the christmas trees are beautiful as well . Also , the whether is nicer . Usually it will run in the low 70s during the day . If you are near the water it is a little cold and windy , but not too bad . Also , the parades in the park are themed for Christmas and very nice to see . However , if you have never been to Disney , you may want to see the regular parades . The crowds can be bad , but I have gone several times during Christmas and it is a great time of the year to go . I highly recommend staying away from the time around July 4 . During this time almost all of the parks will close due to capacity . So lines are extremely long and it is terrible to try to get around . Also , it is very hard . Combine the large crowds and the heat and it can be misserable . You will not have as much fun if it is this hot and crowded as you would otherwise . however , the fireworks during this time are spectacular and will not dissapoint . But you have to wait a long time in order to see them from a good location.I usually prefer going after school has started . September/October is a great time . The weather is nice , crowds are n't and big as the other times of the year . If you go in value season you can save yourself some money . Keep in mind , Disney will often do refurbishments during this time because it is not as busy , so some attractions may be closed while you are there . But it easy to find this out ahead of time . Also , if you go in October you can go to Mickey 's not so scary halloween . This is a must see if you go during this time . The park is closed early that day and you have to have another ticket to get in . But there is a fraction of the people in the park . There are rides open and you basically walk right on . It is nice to be there when it is n't as busy and it is really neat as well . Plus , if you have kids , it is more kid friendly than the Universal Halloween party.So you need to think about what you prefer and then take your vacation at that time of year .",0

"best way to invest money ... risks doesnt matter for me ? It 's been mathematically `` proven '' that you can get high returns AND reduce your risk by buying diverse high-risk investments which have no correllation.Also , Equities ( Stocks ) have had some of the best returns historically , and are still considered a very good investment.Of course you do n't want to be STUPID about it and buy the riskiest stuff possible . Get some AGGRESSIVE mutual funds with low fees ( Vanguard has some ) . Spread your money around to highly aggressive funds that have little correllation . For instance , some Domestic High Growth , some Foreign aggressive growth , maybe some Real Estate Trust Funds , some High Tech , Some Health Care.Look at the historic returns of the sector and the fund . Look too at the risk vs. return . If , as you say , risks do n't matter , then go for high return funds , with a reasonable risk . And spread it around - but make sure you spread it around to different TYPES of investments - all that are aggressive , but some that move contrary to each other ( like foreign vs domestic , or REITs vs Stock )",0

I have been a registered respiratory therapist for 17 years now . The job can be very stressful depending on which type of facility that you work in . You must have a strong stomach because some of the things that we do can be quite disgusting ; such as tracheostomy care and suctioning sputum . The job can also be extremely tiring physically because of all the standing and walking within the hospital . The nursing field pays a little better . One thing that does bother me is that the nurses seem to have some direction over the therapist when it comes to the patient and sometimes try to overide our decisions . Overall , it has been a good career but I do n't think I would go back into the field again if I could do it over .",0

What about the Seneca Falls Convention sparked the women 's suffrage movement ? I am doing a documentary on the above topic and would like your help ! It brought women together for the first time to discuss these issues under the leadership of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott . These women had been active in the fight against slavery and were aware of women 's second grade status - there is an interesting parallel with second wave feminism a century later . It used the rhetoric of the Declaration of Independence to appeal to American ideas of political participation.Good luck with the documentary .,0

"Who is Hosni Mubarak 's successor in ruling Egypt ? it is not really clear . the egyptian parliament nominates a single candidate , who is then confirmed by a referendum vote ( which is typically a massively-rigged election ) . egypt has been moving to democratize lately , but it looks to be a slow process and mubarak will likely not let much power slip from his hands.the economist seems to think that mubarak has been preparing his son , Galal Mubarak , to take over before he dies or steps down . however this has been met with public disapproval and it is not really certain just who would take over . if mubarak were to suddenly die , it would probably be a time of crisis in egypt that could either lead to a more democratic society or possibly civil war .",0

"what 3d geometric shape has 3 faces and 2 sides ?

"If angels were created with no will ( unlike humans ) then how did Lucifer ever turn evil ? Greetings ! On the contrary , the beings referred to as angels were created with a free-will just as we were . Though they were initially created `` holy '' and superiour to human beings , made to serve in the very presence of God , they have the capability of falling under temptation , and can choose to do evil . Lucifer , who was second-in-command next to God himself , said to have been the most beautiful of all God 's angels , desired to be more powerful than God and sought to rebel against Him . God , therefore , cast Lucifer out of Heaven along with those who chose to follow him .",0
"interfaith marriage ? How can a devoted Catholic woman overcome restrictions in the bible ( which she believes in ) to marry a non-Christian ? I suppose today 's society is n't as tribal as the past societies or the ones you still see in 3rd world countries where women were nothing but chattel.Based on that it 's quite simple today to find someone you love having most of the qualities you desire - yes , even in the religious sense.A devout Catholic women should be chaste and so must her husband . Both should have a pure state of mind and believe in God.There are many non-Christians who are n't Christians or Catholics but still have a sense of God , but are not ready to make a huge commitment to the Christian or Catholic faith if they 're not ready yet.Many non-Christians are chaste , have pure , good hearts and I 'm sure we all know not all Christians are better than non-Christians . I 've met alot of non-Christians with hearts of gold that 'd put many hollow-faithed and judgemental Christians to great shame if they were put together.It maybe a matter of time before this person actually decides to take God and Christ into his or her heart , or through the spouse 's good conduct and deep faith , decide that , yes , the children are better off having a religion then just skulking around in the wide open space looking for something.So , I do n't think we should judge non-Christians harshly - unless as individuals they have less-than-honourable conduct and character . It takes a lot of love , effort , acceptance and faith in God , as well as time , for the spouse to realise that yes , I want to accept Christ in my life.And of course , when the children come their religious beliefs will form naturally in the family .",0

"What 's the best way to lose weight ? Start eating fruits such as pineapple , grape , pappaya , watermelon , mango , kiwi , strawberry etc as much as you want . Two hours later , eat a large salad with everything except meat , fish , or egg . Two hours after ( at least ) eat the dinner with your favarite meat , fish , etc . Do not go for seconds . Drink a glass of water just before eating the dinner , this will help you not to want to go for seconds , and using a small plate also will help . Drink 7 glasses of water all through out the day . One more thing do not eat anything three hours before going to sleep only water if the urge comes up.Keep doing this for a week , you will loose weight in a healthy way , and this will help you keep it off as well because you are eating everything you want to eat and you do not have the feeling of hunger or thirst . The fruits in the morning will help you to curb your need for eating all the time feeling for the rest of the day because it is natural sugarMake sure you do not eat for two hours after each meal and when you feel like eating something grab a glass of water . Replace your sugar drinks with water and after dinner you can have a glass of wine or beer as well.I tried every diet in the world and nothing worked and at 53 it worked and I am at 57 healthy and very energetic .",0

"how to correct red eye in photography ? If you want to eliminate red-eye before your photo even makes it into the computer : Red eye is caused when flash is fired directly into the eye , bounces off the red blood vessels at the back of the eye , and is reflected back into the lens.The solution would be to fire the flash at an angle , for example , downwards towards the subjects , rather than right at them . This would require an external flash unit that has a swivel head , and of course , for inexpensive point and shoots , this is not really an option , but I put it out there . Not only will you eliminate red eye but you will greatly improve the look of your photos is you learn how to use an external flash unit properly and bounce light off nearby walls.Or , in some cases , why not turn off the flash altogether and prop your camera against a surface or use a tripod , and get the subjects to stay still a little . Not possible when you 're in the middle of the action , or in very poorly lit areas , but sometimes doable . Your pictures will be a lot better off without the harsh light that those built in flash units provide .",0

Seasonal Defense combines andrographis with other immune-supporting herbs , including Fructus aurantia ( six percent synephrine extract ) , thyme , oregano and eleuthero root for complete immune support.Andrographis has been used for centuries by many cultures . It is used widely in Ayurvedic medicine and is considered a “ cold property ” herb in traditional Chinese approaches ; it is used to rid the body of “ heat ” and dispel toxins . Andrographis supports the immune system by promoting both specific and non-specific immune-response functions as well as maintaining the muscles in the respiratory system . Other studies show that synephrine may be able to help maintain the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract and that thyme and eleuthero root both have beneficial properties. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Benefits : • Helps the body defend against seasonal changes . • Contains andrographis to help boost the immune system . • Helps support mucous membrane health .

"How do you create HD 3D video games for the PS3 or XBox 360 ? It 's important that it 's HD . If possible , can youlist the name of software that helps ? I do n't know much about console programming.ALso , along with the software name , can you give me web sites that might help , and a number of the best programming languages . What you need is the SDK ( Software Development Kit ) for the particular console that you are developing for . Unfortunally these kits usually cost $ 10+ and even more unfortunally you ca n't get them . Most Console license holders ( like Microsoft or Sony ) will only lease a kit to you if you a big company with an active title in development and a published deal ready . It is almost impossible to get a kit if you are a single developer.I suggest making a PC game with DirectX , the directX SDK is free . It is a good place to get started and Microsoft 's Xbox uses a very similar almost identical interface . So if you can swing a publisher deal and convince Microsoft to let use use a SDK you wo n't have much trouble getting your game to work on the XBox.When you game is ready License holder will put your game through a set of rigorious tests to see if it is stable and conforms to all the rules of the particular system , if that all works out they will allow you to release the game.Almost every professional game with VERY few exceptions are written in C++.Compared to all this making the game work on a HD Televison is trival .",0

"Why do so many women like bad boy types ? The debate of `` nice guys vs. bad boys '' has been raging for quite a long time . The nature of being a `` nice guy '' , however , is commonly misunderstood . It is believed that being polite , considerate , friendly , tender , romantic , etc . is what being a `` nice guy '' is all about and thus those qualities should be avoided , as it is the `` bad boy '' , the rude , the inconsiderate , the impolite , the rough guy who always gets the girl while the `` nice guy '' is waiting outside in the pouring rain with flowers in his hand.It does n't mean that women prefer rude over polite , inconsiderate over considerate , etc . It all becomes clear when we look at a very important issue often overlooked when trying to define what makes the `` bad boys '' beat the `` nice guys '' when it comes to getting the girls . It is sexuality - the `` bad boys '' are not afraid to show that they are sexual beings , while the `` nice guys '' hide their sexuality as a part of their agenda of being friendly , polite , and courteous towards women .",0

"Can i install a intercooler on my car w/o the turbo ? intake hose on 1 tube & the air filter side of intercoole You can install anything you want . The real question should be : Will intercooling help performance of a non-turbo car . The reason for the intercooler is to decrease the temperature of the forced air generated by the turbo . Consider the fact that it is compressed air generated by hot exhaust gases which turn the vane in the turbo . By cooling the air generated by the turbo , you can increase the power capability . You can research air/air intercoolers and even water/ice/air intercoolers on yahoo search.To answer your question , yes you could install one but you would likely see no performance gain and maybe even a drop . This is due to the additional volume added to the intake tract by the piping and intercooler itself . Your best bet is a cold air intake which you can buy from most any aftermarket parts place .",0

"M1 Abrams or M2 Bradley , which is a better combat vehicle ? If you were in combat , which one would you feel safer in ? M1 Abrams is USA MBT ( Main Battle Tank ) , of course it have better armor and better firepower . M2 Bradley only have a single 25mm machinegun , another machinegun placed coaxially and several TOWs missile ( more later variant carry less missiles ) meanwhile M1 have a 12.7mm machinegun , two 7.62mm machinegun and one 105 mm rifled tank gun ( for original M1 ) or 120 mm smoothbore gun ( for M1A1 & M1A2 ) that able to shoot many type of shells . Obviously , M1 have better accuracy than M2 ( M1 have better aiming equipment ) , considering M1 main role ( M2 is APC , not MBT ) . M2 was created because the existing APC at that time ca n't compete with M1 speed , hindering M1 overall movement . So using M1 base , they create M2 , APC version of M1.So , M1 absolutely tougher and have more firepower than M2 . And they both have the same speed . And for reliable , as they have different role ( MBT and APC ) , I ca n't say which is better . But one thing for sure , M2 is n't bad because their survivability rate is very high.Of course , in battle , I feel a lot safer in M1 than in M2 . But if I can choose , I definitely want to be inside Merkava Mk-IV , it 's the best MBT in this world ( of course , it 's more superior than M1 Abrams ) .",0

"Earth is a phenomena and a woman too is a phenomena .Man is part of this phenomena . Why GOD is called HE ? read Concept of God has emerged in the mankind after being born and based on the behaviour pattern of human beings alone.Religions have unable to convey the essence and existance of GOD which could unite every human being without doubts.Religions have created more doubts . However many followers , which kept dividing in numbers , according to technical interpretations , and , became politicl force.Reality of the ABSOLUTE got lost.Earth lost importance , motherhood too lost significance.What is reality ? A spermis a phenomena but is part of of a phenomena called Ovum.Mensurations periods of a woman are like monsoon periods on Earth which prepares itself for creating life all arround .Woman sheds her blood and earth the essence of blood , water.In stead of calling let us save this Earth , let Us say O ! mother Earth accept us with LOVE in YOUR WOMB .The GOD inside this phenomena will listen to your prayers .God is experienced in every mode of nature and not outside it as propagated by religion God is commonly referred to in the masculine sense because of the relationship that primarily judaism based religions wished to portray between god and mankind . God the Father , because at the time all the ancient religious texts for these religions were written a family was dominated by the father and rather than using the metaphor of the mother , which would imply at the time that there was some other superior to the God figure , they used a masculine term . This term has persisted due to a continuation of male dominance in society and through the institution of tradition which is now so ancient that many believe it would be heresy to alter it today . It is true that the relationship that many today share with god is much better described as female , but this too stems from the feminization of 'soft ' concepts such as love and procreation . Consequently calling God male or female is 100 % related to culture and I would like to answer your question with a question . Why try to personify god as male or female ? If you follow western society 's modern beleif that male and female are equal , or the more radical belief that there is no definite male or female but shades of gender ( see transgender ) , and if gender serves the sole function of procreation through sexual intercourse why attempt to place the all powerful being that is God within the restraints of a single gender . God does not need to procreate through sexuality as God is capable of creation without thought or effort . So , why call God she ? Why not just understand that God is God regardless of name or gender .",0

"what is a good homemade remedy for constipation ? Folks , do you know how NASTY prune juice is ? *shudder*Prunes do work ( and prune juice , if you 're a taste bud masochist ) ; however , they work by a chemical laxative - it 's a natural chemical , but you do n't want to take any chemical inducement on a regular basis , even if it comes from a tree and not from a test tube.If this is a one time thing , it does n't matter really whether you take ex-lax or prunes , they will both work.However , if you have constipation fairly often , it 's going to be more of a management thing than a quick fix sort of thing . At that means adding fiber to your diet . Still , you do n't need to take metamucil every night . First , eat the most whole grain bread you like . For some people , switching from white to whole grain bread may be all you need.Here are some other good sources : Fruits and veggies - the crunchier the better . Apples are especially good , as are whole oranges . ( And cooking does n't destroy fiber , so it only needs to be crunchy in its raw state.Oatmeal , brown rice , and other whole grain cereals and grains . And anything made with these.Citrus marmalades ! Citrus skin is an excellent source of both vitamin C and fiber.Dried fruit . Raisins are good , without the er , immediacy that prunes can incur.So , metamucil , apple , or oatmeal raisin cookie with diced orange peel .",0

Why ca n't the telemarketer hear me say `` Hello '' when I answer the phone ? Everytime a telemarketer calls I say `` Hello . '' Then it takes a few seconds and they say `` Hello ? '' As if they are wondering if anyone answered . Why is this the case ? Telemarketers do not actually dial the phone calls . They sit at a desk and wait to be alerted that they are being connected to a call through their call system . It would be a waste of time for telemarketers to wait on the line for someone to answer the phone because there could be no answer or they could get your voicemail . Your voice actually triggers the connection . They do not hear you say hello because they have not been connected to you yet .,0
"What is a post-masters graduate certificate ? I have found a school that offers a post-masters graduate certificate . They say it is almost as good as a PHD . Any suggestions The post-masters graduate certificate is a degree level that is intermediate between the masters degree and the doctorate . It became popular in education careers where promotions or job grades depended in part on educational level . They recognized this `` sixth year '' degree level as one year of study beyond the master 's degree . You also sometimes see it referred to as a `` specialist 's '' degree because some of the early post-masters degrees were Educational Specialist ( Ed.S . ) degrees . Other common names are Certificate of Advanced Study or Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study . The utility of the post-masters certificate depends on what field you are in and why you want the degree . Some fields of study have the specialist level as the entering level for certification or licensure ( school psychology , for example ) , in which case you would find it vital . Some fields ( counseling , for example ) might have the level of training required for licensure at the equivalent of the post-masters certificate level ( 60 semester hours ) in which case having the certificate would be an advantage if you want to get licensed . Some fields allow you to specialize after taking a post masters certificate ( i.e . Infant Mental Health Nursing ) in which case the certificate is very useful . On the other hand , some fields really require a doctorate ( most college teaching , for example ) in which case the post-masters certificate , while good to have , wo n't fulfil the occupational requirement.I think the post-masters certificate is nice if you are working toward continuing education as it can help you make a more systematic study in your area of interest , and it appears that you have met a more unified goal than just taking courses.Hope this helps .",0

"how small can you get a mp3 song and how would you do it ? when i rip songs from cds ( about 4 min songs ) they can be from 3-8mb can i make them smaller but not wreck the sound quality.and will the music work on an mp3 player mp3 is a compression of your music . The standard is from CD to 128 kbit/s w/ cd quality being 1400 kbit/s . To make smaller , you compress more and therefore take away quality ( details are taken out to compress . ) There are other compression formats to use , but by definition they all compress the info and therefore lose quality . Try 96 kbit/s and see if you notice a difference . ( This will be found in the recording media ; ie . the program that `` rips '' CD to mp3 . ) Again 128 is standard for not noticing quality loss . VBR is a good choice . It breaks the songs into segments so that low quality sections can have lower bit rate . Set VBR from 96-128 .",0

"what impcat of personal computers does it have on correspondence ? Personal computers introduced a more efficient form of asynchronous communication . Synchronous communication is when both parties are talking , communicating at the same time . This is like a chat room , or a telephone conversation . The difficulty that this can cause arises with the different time zones , schedule conflicts , etc.Asychronous communication is when both parties need not be present , thereby eliminating the difficulty of time zones and other scheduling difficulties . Prior to personal computers being used for correspondence , mail was used . Because of the delays between writing a message , a letter , and the recipient getting the letter , this was not very efficient . The telegraph sped up the process a bit , but could be expensive , and did not allow for long and detailed messages . Fax machines helped speed up the process , but , for a long time , you needed specialized and expensive equipment . E-mail introduced a very fast , and inexpensive , means of asynchronous communication , and because personal computers are becoming more and more common , more people are able to use the process .",0

"Italian American Reconciliation by : John Patrick Shanley ? First Produced 1986 Eugene O'Neill Theater Center , Waterford , CT , USA > > > Published 1989 Dramatist Play Service , NY Genre Comic Folktale Parts Male 2 Female 3 Other Synopsis : Huey Maximilian Bonfigliano has a problem : While he is safely divorced from his shrewish first wife , Janice , who shot his dog and even took a bead on him , he feels he can not regain his `` manhood '' until he woos and wins her one more timeif only to put his broken marriage behind him once and for all . He enlists the aid of his lifelong buddy , Aldo Scalicki , a confirmed bachelor who tries , without apparent success , to convince Huey that he would be better off sticking with his new lady friend , Teresa , a usually placid young waitress whose indignation flares when she learns what Huey is up to . In a moonlit balcony scene ( hilariously reminiscent of Cyrano de Bergerac ) Aldo pleads his lovesick friend 's case and , to his astonishment , Janice capitulatesalthough not for long . However we do learn that her earlier abuse of Huey was intended to make him `` act like a man '' which , at last , he does . And , more than that , he ( and the audience ) become aware that , in the final essence , `` the greatestand onlysuccess is to be able to love '' a truth which emerges delightfully from the heartwarming , wonderfully antic and always imaginatively conceived action of the play .",0

"whats the origin of HIV/AIDS ? It is now generally accepted that HIV is a descendant of a Simian Immunodeficiency Virus because certain strains of SIVs bear a very close resemblance to HIV-1 and HIV-2 , the two types of HIV.HIV-2 for example corresponds to SIVsm , a strain of the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus found in the sooty mangabey ( also known as the green monkey ) , which is indigenous to western Africa.The more virulent strain of HIV , namely HIV-1 , was until recently more difficult to place . Until 1999 , the closest counterpart that had been identified was SIVcpz , the SIV found in chimpanzees . However , this virus still had certain significant differences from HIV.It has been known for a long time that certain viruses can pass between species . Indeed , the very fact that chimpanzees obtained SIV from two other species of ape shows just how easily this crossover can occur . As animals ourselves , we are just as susceptible . When a viral transfer between animals and humans takes place , it is known as zoonosis.Below are some of the most common theories about how this 'zoonosis ' took place , and how SIV became HIV in humans : The 'Hunter ' Theory The most commonly accepted theory is that of the 'hunter ' . In this scenario , SIVcpz was transferred to humans as a result of chimps being killed and eaten or their blood getting into cuts or wounds on the hunter . Normally the hunter 's body would have fought off SIV , but on a few occasions it adapted itself within its new human host and become HIV-1 . The fact that there were several different early strains of HIV , each with a slightly different genetic make-up ( the most common of which was HIV-1 group M ) , would support this theory : every time it passed from a chimpanzee to a man , it would have developed in a slightly different way within his body , and thus produced a slightly different strain.An article published in The Lancet in 20043 , also shows how retroviral transfer from primates to hunters is still occurring even today . In a sample of 1099 individuals in Cameroon , they discovered to ten ( 1 % ) were infected with SFV ( Simian Foamy Virus ) , an illness which , like SIV , was previously thought only to infect primates . All these infections were believed to have been acquired through the butchering and consumption of monkey and ape meat . Discoveries such as this have lead to calls for an outright ban on bushmeat hunting to prevent simian viruses being passed to humans.The Oral Polio Vaccine ( OPV ) theory Could production of the oral polio vaccine have contributed to the spread of HIV ? Some other rather controversial theories have contended that HIV was transferred iatrogenically ( i.e . via medical experiments ) . One particularly well-publicised idea is that polio vaccines played a role in the transfer.In his book , The River , the journalist Edward Hooper suggested that HIV could be traced to the testing of an oral polio vaccine called Chat , given to about a million people in the Belgian Congo , Ruanda and Urundi in the late 1950s . To be reproduced , live polio vaccine needs to be cultivated in living tissue , and Hooper 's belief is that Chat was grown in kidney cells taken from local chimps infected with SIVcmz . This , he claims , would have resulted in the contamination of the vaccine with chimp SIV , and a large number of people subsequently becoming infected with HIV-1.However , in February 2000 the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia ( one of the original places that developed the Chat vaccine ) announced that it had discovered in its stores a phial of polio vaccine that had been used as part of the program . The vaccine was subsequently analysed and in April 2001 it was announced4 that no trace had been found of either HIV or chimpanzee SIV . A second analysis5 confirmed that only macaque monkey kidney cells , which can not be infected with SIV or HIV , were used to make Chat . While this is just one phial of many , most have taken its existence to mean that the OPV vacc",0

"What is the meaning of the English soccer term `` cup-tied '' when applied to an individual player ? Cup-tied is an adjective , used primarily in football ( soccer ) , used to describe a player who is ineligible to play in a knockout cup competition after transferring from another club during that competition.In virtually all domestic and international cup competitions , any player who makes an appearance for a club at any stage of the competition is `` tied '' to that club for all future matches during that season in the same competition . This prevents a strong team from gaining an unfair advantage by signing a talented player from a club that has lost in an earlier round . A team that wishes to transfer a player may deliberately choose to keep that player off its cup roster to ensure that he is not cup-tied , increasing his usefulness to a club that may be involved in the same competition . A recent example of this was Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez ' decision to keep Milan Baroš off Liverpool 's roster for their 2005-06 UEFA Champions League ties in order to retain his value to clubs interested in purchasing the Czech striker 's services . ( Baroš eventually moved to Aston Villa , which was not involved in the Champions League . ) Similarly , although far less often , a team may deliberately cup-tie a player to discourage a transfer during that season . Note , however , that this does not restrict most international transfers ; cup-tying is only an issue internationally if both teams involved in the transfer have participated in a continental cup competition such as the UEFA Champions League or UEFA Cup .",0

"what is the best way to get money for college ? The first thing you need to know about money for college is that there are two kinds . Free and not free .

To get scholarships some people think you have to be a `` straight A '' student or an exceptional athlete . Although those things do help , they are n't always necessary . You may have certain unique talents and abilities that can earn you scholarships regardless of your grades . Try visiting www.fastweb.com . You can use this site to make a profile and they will e-mail you scholarship opportunities that apply specifically to you ! Two kids from my high school won a scholarship for making their prom outfits out of duct tape ! True story ! Not all of the scholarships are that crazy but again , they do n't necessarily relate to grades or sports . If you do have good grades and/or play sports ; great ! Use that in your profile and they will send you opportunities that apply directly to your talents . It is totally free and there is no limit as to how many scholarships you can apply for and even win . So try to pay for everything you can with scholarships and then you may need to fill in some gaps with loans . Your next stop : www.fasfa.com . There you will apply for financial aid . You will need your most recent W-2 and your parents help when you apply . If you do n't have parents or you are over 24 years of age you get to skip the parent section . This site may reward you with some scholarships as well but it 's usually mostly government loans . That is why I would suggest applying for dozens of scholarships first . Good luck finding the money and good luck once you start school . Remember ; for every hour spent in class you should spend two hours studying !",0

And If any of you a doctor , I would appreciate it for you to give me some thoughts . There is a shot for the chicken pox , unfortunately it 's a vaccine that you take to avoid getting them . Once you get them , you got them . Try bathing in Aveeno ( available at walmart ) to help with the itching to possibly avoid many eruptions , and take Tylenol or Advil for the headache and fever .

"Did the US government really steal Arizona , Texas and New Mexico ? What is your perception ? Any input ? As far as the story goes , Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana , president of Mexico 150 years ago , sold part of the Mexican territory ( now Arizona , Texas and New Mexico ) to the US government . Others , specially politicians , say it was stolen by the US . That all really depends on your definition of `` stole . '' Technically , the Mexican government signed the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo , ceding all of the territories to which you refer in exchange for $ 15 million and ending the Mexican-American War . One could say , however , that the Mexican-American War was merely a pretext for taking all of the territory , and it is likely not far from the truth . Also , a large chunk of Arizona and a section of New Mexico were purchased after the stealing of the rest in 1853 as the Gadsden Purchase , in which the US paid Mexico $ 10 million , about $ 343,826,098 accounting for inflation .",0

"*Ali versus Tyson* Who would win ? This is a theoretical question ( of course Tyson would win today ) . If both men were in their prime at the peak of their success and squared off who would win ? Mike Tyson in his prime was a monster . With his power and skill combined , you 'd think he was unbeatable . He knew how to bob and weave right under an opponent 's punches and come back with vicious combos to the head and body.However , I do n't think any heavyweight boxer ever could outbox Ali . Muhammad Ali knew how to use the ring and could use his reach advantage to keep Tyson at the perfect distance to land punches while avoiding being hit himself . Not that I do n't think Ali could n't take Tyson 's punches , but those body shots would have worn him down a bit by the later rounds.Overall , I say an unanimous decision victory for Ali , though not a very impressive one .",0

"Is the Brady Bill based on a Nazi Gun Control Law ? I was told it was the exact same - almost word for translated word . Ridiculous . Is the law requiring cars to stop at a stop sign based on a Nazi law ? Because the laws are remarkably similar to laws in Nazi Germany requiring cars to stop at stop signs . ( One group has claimed that the origin of the distinction between guns suitable for sporting use and other guns comes from Nazi Germany . And the group further claims that when the Brady Bill attempts to outlaw private ownership of semi-automatic weapons ( which are only good for killing large numbers of people quickly , in war or otherwise , or practising to do so ) it is applying this distinction first developed in Nazi law . But 1 ) that is a far cry from the Brady Bill being a `` translation '' of Nazi legislation , 2 ) the Brady Bill ban on selected semi-automatic weapons is not the same as a ban on private ownership of any weapon not suitable for sporting use , and 3 ) the concept of a ban on such weapons in private hands goes back way before the Nazis , and existed throughout Europe , back into the days of Kings and nobility . It was not invented by the Nazis.Oppose gun control if you like . But this is not a reason to do so .",0

"The IRS said i had to pay a penalty . i filed a dispute . am i legally obligated to pay unless they follow up ? the IRS never wrote back once i filed the dispute . am i legally allowed not to pay ? You did n't say what the penalty was for ( late filing , late payment , interest , trust fund penalties , etc. ) . Nor did you state who is handling your dispute ( IRS Appeals , Collection Due Process , Tax Court ) . There 's slightly different rules depending on what 's going on.The basic process for handling penalties and disputes is outlined on the IRS website.In general , the IRS will investigate whether you are responsible for the penalty , and will send up a notice informing you that the penalty was waived or that you really do owe the penalty . Interest will accrue if you really do owe the penalty , but you have n't paid it yet.Generally , I advise my clients to pay all penalties in full , and then dispute the penalties . This shows a good faith effort , and stops additional penalties and interest from being added to the account . If we lose the dispute , at least the client paid only the penalty and not additional interest . If we win , the client gets his money back.I hope this helps . Let us know how your dispute with the IRS turns out.Best wishes.William",0

"Why do people say `` God bless you '' after one sneezes ? The custom of saying `` God bless you '' after a sneeze was begun literally as a blessing . Pope Gregory the Great ( 540-604 AD ) ascended to the Papacy just in time for the start of the plague ( his successor succumbed to it ) . When someone sneezed , they were immediately blessed ( `` God bless you ! '' ) in the hope that they would not subsequently develop the plague .

Its the same concept isnt it ? ? ? It is and established fact that cardio in the morning on an empty stomack increases your fat burning expodentially . However approx 30 minutes after your session is over your body will begin to go after your muscles for energy rather than your fat cell or carbs and you will be in effect working against your goal .

"How do you bind a vampire or a werewolf ? Aside from holy water , garlic , etc. , what do the myths say ? If werewolves can be killed with a silver bullet , with what material do you capture them alive ? Do plain metal chains work ? Or do they have to be made of certain materials ? The Slavs ( from around the year 300 ) believed that vampires were afraid of silver ( but could n't be killed with it ) and that one could kill them by cutting their head off and placing it between their legs , or by stabbing them with a wooden stake in the heart . During the Middle Ages , the myth transformed a bit . People used holy water , wooden stake , and cross to kill a vampire ( we can see the influence of the Christianity here ) . If people suspected that a dead person has turned into a vampire , they would dig them out and stick a stake into the heart . This was n't meant to kill the vampire but to bind it to the grave . Serbs believed that every single drop of blood had to be destroyed or else the vampire would still be `` alive '' ( they were more or less living corpses , but you get my point ) so they used to burn the vampire after that . Then butterflies would fly out of the vampire and people had to kill each one of them . Garlic can only scare the vampire because of its strong and unpleasant smell . In order to stop the vampire 's visits at night , people would hang garlic near every hole in the house ( for example keyhole , chimney , windows ... , because people believed that the vampire could enter the house even through the smallest hole ) . One could also throw some seeds before the vampire , since they had to stop and count them all . I 'm not really sure how they used to capture them . I know vampires could be captured by stealing that cloth they had over them in the grave , but I have seen this only in vampire stories . But in reality , people were just killing them and they were probably too scared to just capture them ( that 'd be pointless , would n't it ) . Although in Asia there were some kinds of vampires which people used to capture and then keep them in wooden cages and feed them eggs : P I have n't heard of any captured werewolves either . If you want to investigate a bit , try reading some legends and old beliefs from the Balkans ; I promise you 'll find it very interesting !",0

There is nothing you can do about this . It is controlled by genetics and may change with age . You may be able to make it look beter by developing the underlying muscles .

God 's personality is better than anyone else 's cause it 's pure and not marred by the influence of this secular world .",0
"i want information on VLSI systems or paper on it. ? i want to present paper on VLSI systems . Very-large-scale integration ( VLSI ) of systems of transistor-based circuits into integrated circuits on a single chip first occurred in the 1980s as part of the semiconductor and communication technologies that were being developed.The first semiconductor chips held one transistor each . Subsequent advances added more and more transistors , and as a consequence more individual functions or systems were integrated over time . The microprocessor is a VLSI device.The first `` generation '' of computers relied on vacuum tubes . Then came discrete semiconductor devices , followed by integrated circuits . The first Small-Scale Integration ( SSI ) ICs had small numbers of devices on a single chip – diodes , transistors , resistors and capacitors ( no inductors though ) , making it possible to fabricate one or more logic gates on a single device . The fourth generation consisted of Large-Scale Integration ( LSI ) , i.e . systems with at least a thousand logic gates . The natural successor to LSI was VLSI ( many tens of thousands of gates on a single chip ) . Current technology has moved far past this mark and today 's microprocessors have many millions of gates and hundreds of millions of individual transistors.As of mid-2004 , billion-transistor processors are not yet economically feasible for most uses , but they are achievable in laboratory settings , and they are clearly on the horizon as semiconductor fabrication moves from the current generation of 90 nanometer ( 90nm ) processes to the next 65nm and 45nm generations.At one time , there was an effort to name and calibrate various levels of large-scale integration above VLSI . Terms like Ultra-large-scale Integration ( ULSI ) were used . But the huge number of gates and transistors available on common devices has rendered such fine distinctions moot . Terms suggesting more-than-VLSI levels of integration are no longer in widespread use . Even VLSI is now somewhat quaint , given the common assumption that all microprocessors are VLSI or better .",0

We are more roommates now . Here 's a hint : Men like women to show initiative with romance and eroticsm -- too often in relationships it 's considered the `` man 's job '' to get things moving ! This will sound corny , but give it a shot : First , if you 've got kids , send them to the grandparents for the night in advance without him knowing ( say on a Friday ) . Next , turn off all the lights in the house and place scented candles in the bedroom and run a hot bubble bath just before he normally arives home . Have some wine and two wine glasses at the ready on the coffee table , and rose petals on the floor leading a trail to the bedroom -- or whereever you 're most memorable encounter that you can remember occurred . Personally , I like David Sanborn or some other smooth jazz playing in the background . Music is important to setting the mood , and if you 've got cable or a dish , you can tune it to the music of your choice . Just before he gets home , slip into a nice satin & lace nightie and cover it with a heavy robe . When he gets to the door , be there waiting to flash him and let him know what you 've got in store for the evening . Not in a crude way , mind you . Most importantly , take your time ... do n't rush . The anticipation of that which is to come will be as intense as the act itself . Hope that helps ! Peace , JayZ",0

"Why are people considered racist if they do n't want illegal Mexicans in america even if they are ok withlegals People are often dubbed Racist if they support tougher immigration laws.If someone is angry at illegal Mexicans but ok with legal ones the are not racist.Lets face facts people at least 70 % of illegal immigration comes from Mexico.Those who propose tougher border laws are not big bad bigots , they are patriots wishing to protect this country and its economy and security . What exactly is `` handed off '' to illegal immigrants ? The general assumption that illegal immigrants are here to take what 's rightfully yours is as racist as it is ignorant.Immigrants ( legal or not ) come here looking for better opportunities and quality of life.Illegal immigrants are faced with hardships you could n't understand unless you became one . They are forced to work two and three different jobs making less than minimum wage and are taken advantage of because of their legal status.What 's ironic is that they pay taxes just like you and me.So ... they work harder for less money and on top of that pay taxes that pay the salaries of those politicians so thirsty to kick them out of the country.Going back to the original question ; those that do n't want illegal mexicans in this country are not racists . They just find it hypocritical that a group of people braking the law ( a federal one at that ) are protected by some politicians just to gain popular acceptance.To those of you that share the asker 's opinion that illegal immigrants are a threat to `` this country and its economy and security '' , I ask - how has illegal immigration affected you directly ? Did anybody get your dream job because they would do it for less money ? Did anybody get the low rent apartment you wanted ? ****** stoop_fer_lyfe ******I DO KNOW what I 'm talking about . I also live in a community riddled with illegal immigrants and am very close to many of them.What you fail to understand is that they buy new cars , buy houses or apartments and have credit cards - all things that need a credit report . Banks have changed credit requirements to accommodate them because financial institutions are not immigration officers , they are in business to make money and are not braking any law by lending money to someone that can provide Income Tax Returns . It may also be hard for you to believe that the government - regardless of the red flags it raises - accepts those Tax Returns and turns a blind eye to the migration legality of the issuer ; again , the IRS is not responsible for policing immigration laws.Maybe you have never filed a tax return , but you do n't need an employer to report and pay taxes for you . You are then 'Self-Employed ' , and you do n't necessarily need to report all your income since it ca n't be proved.Illegal immigrants know they can live very 'normal ' lives as long as they do n't break any laws other than immigration laws.It seems to me you are the one that DOES NOT KNOW what you are talking about and are merely commenting on what is fed to you by alarmist media . **************I actually enjoy these friendly exchanges.I realized why we are talking about two different illegal immigrants . You are talking about those that cross over illegally ( sneak in the country ) and I 'm talking about those that came here on a visa ( any kind ) and overstayed.The Social Security Administration used to provide SSN cards/numbers to people on temporary visas ; they were stamped with a big 'Not for employment use ' . I do n't have to tell you how easy those cards were to duplicate . I even saw a used car salesman photocopy one , remove those words and photocopy again until he ended with a 'clean ' copy before submitting the loan.On the subject of taxes ... during my college years I worked as a computer consultant , doing odd jobs that payed under $ 550 at a time , that way my 'employer ' did not have to submit a 1099 for professional services . I stayed under the radar and expensed every pencil , calculator , computer part , tool , etc . that I bought during those years .

The day 's associations with romantic love arrived after the High Middle Ages , during which the concept of romantic love was formulated.The day is now most closely associated with the mutual exchange of love notes in the form of `` valentines . '' Modern Valentine symbols include the heart-shaped outline and the figure of the winged Cupid . Starting in the 19th century , the practice of hand writing notes has largely given way to the exchange of mass-produced greeting cards .

"What is the best diet pill for weight loss ? Good question . I will answer by first saying that diet pills are a fraud . Any pill that says you can lose weight by taking it and doing nothing else is wrong.Losing weight is not losing weight if you put it back on . That ’ s what diet pills do , why do you think there is a new popular one every few months.Now if you wonder if there are any good supplements and my answer is yes.There are some supplements that you can take that can enhance a very healthy diet and fitness program and help you to stay committed to it . 7 Keto is an awesome metabolic enhancing compound that helps to reduce body weight and body fat by giving you more of a hormone that tells your thyroid to increase your metabolism . You may say wow , that ’ s what I need . No , the 7-Keto is all you need , not the other stuff . Yes but no , see the body can only take so much of it at a time before its eliminated by the blood and the rest becomes expensive urine . So you cant just take it alone , it must be part of a plan.Hoodia appears to affect the brain by making the stomach feel full and reducing the desire to eat . Offers safe , caffeine-free , non-stimulant weight management support . It also may help in metabolizing fats.Multivitamins - help you maintain the muscle that you have by providing nutrients your cells need . Understand if you don ’ t put enough nutrients in your body , you will lose muscle because your body will eat the muscle for those nutrients.These supplements should be part of an overall lifestyle change , to a healthier one.There are 5 most important things that must go together in any workout program . These are part of changing your complete lifestyle to one that is healthier . They also help you to naturally optimize your metabolism . The faster your metabolism the better your body uses your food for energy , instead of storing it as fat . I put them in the order of importance.1 . Eat more . Yes eat more . More meals that is . It is best to eat a small meal every 3-4 hours . The meal should be just large enough to where you are not hungry , as opposed to eating you are full . There is a difference . Eating 1 or 2 meals a day slows your metabolism down . You should have at least 4-6 meals a day . For most people , your food should be balanced between carbs proteins and fats in a 50-25-25 ratio . Throughout your day you should maintain this ratio 2 . Drink more water . Most of us don ’ t have enough water . This means our bodies are dehydrated . Two things a dehydrated body has trouble doing , one is releasing water . In order to lose fat you must be able to release water , because fat cells in your body are composed of mostly water . A dehydrated body can not build very well . Muscle tone indicates a constant building state in your body . If your body isn ’ t building that means it is losing muscle and it ’ s never good to lose muscle that slows your metabolism and makes you look flabby.3 . Maintain a balanced workout regimen of cardio and resistance ( weights ) . Cardio is good for fat burning and it ’ s easy to do and to progress yourself . Resistance is a little harder because it ’ s not as easy to know what to do . If weights aren ’ t your thing then try Yoga or Pilates . Both are very effective resistance and core training and can help you maintain lean muscle and increase your overall metabolism.4 . Smart supplementation of your diet is your best solution to making sure you get the nutrients your food doesn ’ t give you . I mentioned 7-Keto , Hoodia , and a multivitamin plus cleanse formulas , as well as detox formulas are awesome for eliminating toxins we take into our bodies without knowing.5 . Sleep is a very important part of any healthy lifestyle regimen . When we sleep our bodies and minds refresh themselves and allow us to function at an optimal level . Sleeping allows muscles to rebuild themselves and when they do that , it speeds your metabolism.You may ask why I gave you this long list instead of just telling you what exercises",0

Ennis shuffles around in life , without two nickels to rub together , thinking about Jack , knowing he will never have a relationship with or ever fall in love with anyone again . The real sadness is that two people who in a one-in-a-million chance found true love -- their soulmates , but could not make it work . They tried to blend , and live their lives together discreetly , but it just did n't work . Jack had more interactions with other men , so he was more likely to be caught.The frustrating thing about the 60 's and 70 's was people 's inability to talk . The most was said when nobody was talking . Ennis 's wife tried to talk about it , but Ennis ran out during a Thanksgiving dinner . In the end , Ennis learns about Jack 's death from his wife , who tells a lie to cover up the truth , saying while Jack was changing a tire it blew off the rim and killed him . We are n't told if Ennis believes the lie or knows what really happened . Ennis goes to Jack 's parents ' ranch . He goes to Jack 's room , and finds both his shirt and Jack 's shirt from their summer together on the mountain , hung together on the same hangar . Jack 's mother loved Jack , regardless of his sexuality . There was so much said between the mother and Ennis without one word spoken -- and that was the beauty of the film . The mother knew how much Jack loved Ennis , and she realized that both she and Ennis both loved Jack more than any other people in his life . Jack 's early end was felt most deeply by Ennis and the mother , and you could see the pain in both characters.The only thing of value in Ennis 's life is his love and relationship with Jack . He loves his daughters , but that really is n't on the same level as his relationship with Jack . He keeps the two shirts on the hangar in his closet hung on a peg . This is a symbol of their love -- the shirts being on the same hangar , being together , signify their oneness . That 's why Ennis could not love again , because he became one ( stop the star wars jokes ) with the one he loved . His acknowledgment , and his keeping the shirts , showed that his love for Jack would never die.What I respect most about the film was the way both Jack and Ennis were portrayed . It was very anti-media : there were no men wearing women 's clothes , or talking with lisps , or waving their hands around like little girls . There were no metrosexual marketing schemes , lipstic , or bulging 70 's bell-bottom pants . These were guys who grew up in rural areas and participated as men in all activities , including rodeo , ranching , and making babies . They fully functioned in the tradional sense , in the way people think `` men '' are supposed to act . The only difference was they fell in love with each other . When you escape all the homosexual stereotypes , I ended up forgetting about the gender altogether -- I saw two people in love , a love forbidden by local customs and culture . I wish you could see the film for yourself . Many people I am sure reacted like ol ' Winky . Hate is found in many forms , and passed on from generation to generation , In God 's Holy Name , of course , to give it extra punch . The one and only God of creation , the God who bore me and bore the universe , would never condemn true love between two people , period . Rules and cultural moreys are created by man , for man . Love transcends all those boundaries , and should be respected and nurtured . If hell exists , you can bet there is a special place in hell for people who go out and torture other people ...",0
"why is 13 considered unlucky ? Triskaidekaphobia is the fear of 13 , a number commonly associated with bad luck in Western culture . While fear of the number 13 can be traced back to medieval times , the word triskaidekaphobia itself is of recent vintage , having been first coined by Coriat ( 1911 ; Simpson and Weiner 1992 ) . It seems to have first appeared in the general media in a Nov. 8 , 1953 New York Times article covering discussions of a United Nations committee . This superstition leads some people to fear or avoid anything involving the number 13 . In particular , this leads to interesting practices such as the numbering of floors as 1 , 2 , ... , 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 , ... ( Sloane 's A011760 ; the `` elevator sequence '' ) , omitting the number 13 , in many high-rise American hotels , the numbering of streets avoiding 13th Avenue , and so on . Apparently , 13 has n't always been considered unlucky . In fact , it appears that in ancient times , 13 was either considered in a positive light or ( more commonly ) not at all ( Adams ) . The association of bad luck with the number 13 has been attributed to the fact there were 13 people at the Last Supper of Jesus , although this association seems to have originated only in medieval times . The association has also been linked to that fact that lunisolar calendars ( such as the Hebrew and Chinese calendars ) must have 13 months in some years in order to synchronize the solar and lunar cycles , while the solar Gregorian calendar in universal current usage always has 12 months in a year . Triskaidekaphobia also may be related to Norse mythology , which tells how the god Odin invited eleven of his closest friends to a dinner party at his home in Valhalla , only to have his party crashed by Loki , the god of evil and turmoil , thus giving a total of 13 people . The legend goes on to related how Balder , one of the most beloved gods , tired to throw Loki out of the party , resulting in a scuffle and ultimately Balder 's death with a mistletoe-tipped arrow . Fear of the number 13 also leads to fear of Friday the thirteenth ( a fear recently dubbed paraskevidekatriaphobia ) , despite the fact that Friday turns out to be the most common weekday on which the 13th of a month can occur in the Gregorian calendar . The association of bad luck with Friday appeared in Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales in the late 14th century ( `` and on a Friday fell all this misfortune '' ) , but references to Friday as a day associated with ill luck in general first appear around the middle of the 17th century ( Mikkelson and Mikkelson ) . In particular , it appeared in numerous publications as a particularly unlucky day to start a new venture ( beginning a journey , giving birth , getting married , moving , starting a new job , etc . ) beginning around 1800 ( Mikkelson and Mikkelson ) . While 13 is associated with the number of people at the Last Supper , the Crucifixion took place on a Friday , thus leading to an association of back luck with the combination of this number and day . Note that the association of Friday the thirteenth with the arrest of Jacques de Molay , Grand Master of the Knights Templar , on Friday , October 13 , 1307 by King Philip IV of France is a modern-day invention ( Mikkelson and Mikkelson ) . Paraskevidekatriaphobia is probably the most widespread superstition in the United States , possibly affecting tens of millions of Americans . Interestingly , a study by Scanlon et al . ( 1993 ) published in the prestigious British Medical Journal which analyzed the relation between health , behavior , and superstition surrounding Friday 13th in the United Kingdom by comparing the ratio of traffic volume to traffic accidents on Friday the 6th and Friday the 13th over a period of years found that , `` The risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52 % . Staying at home is recommended . '' While there does not appear to be hard evidence to support the claim , it has been suggested that $ 800 to $ 900 millio",0

"Where do babies come from ? I mean i dont understand the process ... Well ... bear with me , because I may use some off-hand phrases and different words . And in the interest of education , do n't laugh when you hear some ... familiar words.There is a process in which it is done . The mature egg in the woman 's vagina is met with the mature sperm in the man 's testicles through intercourse . This is called fertilization . As soon as the egg is fertile , it becomes known as a zygote . The zygote is then transported to the womb , an organ in the female reproduction system that can expand to the size of a basketball , if the circumstances permit it to . The egg sticks to the side of the womb and grows , multiplying in cell count , fron 1 to 2 , to 4 , to 8 , and et cetra , for the first four months , also called the first Trimester . then it is called an Embyro . for the next trimester , the embyro will assume human characteristics , like arms and legs , and the heart will start beating . For the final trimester , the baby will gain muscle mass and fatty tissue , the tissue that will protect the new baby from harmful impact and harsh weather . After the final trimester , the baby can be given birth via vaginal birth , where the baby comes through the vagina of the mother ( a process that is , indeed , very painful ) , or Cisarean section , also known as C-section , where the mother is surgically cut open to remove the baby ( do n't worry , the doctors put her back together ) . The baby is then taken to a maternity ward for 3 days , so it can get used to the air and oxygen ( 12 months in water does make for a environmental shock ! ) . Then the mother is able to take home the baby , her new son or daughter .",0

"Do they really have govt . grants anyone can get ? It is hard to find grants to start a business . Unlike the myths that some perpetuate , federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business . And yes , grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it , that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.Nonetheless , you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance ( CFDA ) http : //www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http : //www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants . Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.Even if you buy books on `` how to get grants '' or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has , albeit packaged differently . But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.Even SBA does NOT give out grants . From the SBA website http : //www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html '' The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses , although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs . ( See http : //www.sba.gov/financing for more information ) While SBA does offer some grant programs , these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management , technical , or financial assistance . These grants generally support non-profit organizations , intermediary lending institutions , and state and local governments . `` Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements ( e.g . minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant # 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities ( grant 59.043 Women 's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women 's business center that will train women entrepreneurs For private grants , you may want to check the Foundation Center 's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online .

"is a criminal justice a lawyer that goes to court and defends people ? is like what is the diference between pre law studies , criminal justice , law , advanced legal reaserch , coparative law and international law . Haha , no - criminal justice refers to the field of study that examines crime as a social phenomenon , and traditional focuses on the agents , procedures , and systems that societies create in order to deal with crime.Pre-law studies are just that ; they are tracks that some universities offer for those who want to go to law school and who may ( or may not ) know what area of law they want to get in to . From what I understand , these tracks usually consist of courses aimed at improving students ' oral and written communication skills , their critical/analytical thinking , and creativity . Most also provide a survey of the different kinds of law , as well as giving you a historical backdrop for the practice.Advanced legal research - I am not sure what you mean , but legal research in general refers to the process of digging up the legal matters surrounding some topic or issue .

"What items do I need for winter camping to stay warm ? A nice pair of silk long johns is a good place to start . Other little treats for yourself include down clothing , they even make pants . I have a pair of down booties for use in the sleeping bag . Other little clothing tidbits . Wear a hat at all times , even sleeping . You can also sleep with a warm water bottle . Some cautions with this : make sure you know whether the bottle leaks and Nalgene 's are notoriously leaky , if you or your bag gets wet , you may be having a harder time keeping warm . If so you can contain it in a ziplock bag or a roll down velcro closure bag . If the water is too hot , you should put it in a sock or something to keep from burning your skin . My hiking buddy/co worker went to bed with a hot water nalgene between his thighs one night . He thought that was clever because a LOT of blood passes through there and warm blood travels to other parts of the body , warming them . But he woke up with blisters on his thighs ... dangerously close to the family jewels . Last word about hot water bottle , if you use a collapsible canteen or bottle , make sure you fill it allllll the way up , because even then your bottle will cave in as the water cools down . At the very least you want to minimize this so you do n't ruin your bottle . If the bottle cools this way , it will never hold as much as it used to.A good camping mat . The closed cell foam ones that roll up are cheap and effective and very lightweight , the next step up is the self inflating ones but they are heavier . And you can buy covers for those inflating mats that convert them into a chair.You need to dress warm . The most effective thing in my opinion , and also more versatile , is to dress in multiple light layers . In the winter , I wear about 8 layers in the coldest weather ... long john shirt , tee shirt , maybe a button down shirt , a fleece vest , as many fleece crewneck tops ( the fuzzy polartec type , not sweathshirt fleece ) as I can pile on , and my rain jacket . The good news is that if I can add or remove pieces at will until I am perfectly comfortable . IF you go the other route of a couple indoor layers and then one big poofy piece you need to understand the principles of loft , which includes your sleeping bag.Loft is the way insulation in a comforter , parka , or sleeping bag works . They create tiny little air pockets around you and hold YOUR OWN body heat in them . IF you have a lot of clothing between you and the insulating item , you will actually defeat the purpose of the item because you insulate the item FROM your body heat . This is why many things are true : it is better to sleep with fewer clothing items when you want to be warmer in the bag . It is also important not to compromise loft by choosing an item that does n't fit your body and causes you to squash it from the inside out , or with a bunch of heavy layers on top of it to squash it from the outside in . If you compress your item too much , even in storage , or in your pack or its stuff sack , there are fewer air pockets formed and the item does n't work as well.SO choose ONE dressing strategy and know how to apply it.Other important facts : All the things discussed so far are only ways to insulate yourself . They are not generating any heat on their own . To do that , you need to DRINK plenty of water , and you need to EAT , warm foods that are high in sugars and fats are excellent , and you need to MOVE . A bedtime snack can be anything from a candy bar to a stick of butter , NO kidding ! A bedtime activity could be a couple minutes jumping up and down , then one last go at the fire . AND YOU MUST DRINK WATER . Even if you ca n't stand cold liquids . EVEN IF you do n't want to be up all night peeing . Your body needs the water to circulate the blood , and to metabolize food , both of which assist you in staying warm . Another thing you need to know about water is that both dehydration and hypothermia have the early warning sign of disorientation and confusion . The trouble is , if YOU are the one",0

"What is Ash Wednesday ? Ash Wednesday , today , is the beginning of the Catholic religious season of Lent . Lent is a time period where most Catholics choose something to give up ( often sweets , dessert , porn , gambling ) that they tend to indulge in . It is a period of 40 days when Catholics remember the 40 days Jesus fasted in the desert and his ultimate sacrifice at the end of Lent , Good Friday . Marti Gras ( french for Fat Tuesday ) has traditionally become the time for celebration as a last big fling before Lent arrives and people try to restrict themselves more . Also , during Lent , Catholics are supposed to avoid meat other than fish on fridays . On Ash Wednesday , Catholics go to a church service during which the entire congregation processes up to have the priest place ashes on their forehead as a reminder that `` of dust we were made and to dust we shall return '' and our own mortalities .",0

"MS from canada ? as i have done B Tech in ECE , so i m interested in doing MS from canada university.i want 2 get list of universities that have MS programme and also the fee datails along with full living expenses.i dont know where to start from.plz help me out if u can . You should be more ambitious and aim for a school in the US . There 's this story of this Sri Lankan engineer that lived in Canada for three years and could n't find a job . He had to work as a cab driver.He spent two weeks in America and got three to four jobs offers , without US citizenship ! ! ! Also , there is this story of an engineer from India , I think , that got a PH.D in engineering in Germany , he was a professor at some universities in the United States , and published two books , he emigrated to Canada and he works as ... ... . a CAB DRIVER.There was this other guy who got a bachelor 's degree from Harvard and a PH.D. from Stanford , and he could not find a job in Canada . Their excuse , '' His PH.D. from Stanford was equivalent to Grade 13 '' . They wo n't hire the above three highly qualified individuals because they lack `` Canadian work experience '' . Also , note that it is very hard to get a doctorate in Germany . In fact , Germany is the only country in the world that grades your doctorate . I know because I have experienced both Canada and the United States and trust me , you will find far more opportunity in America than Canada . By the way , if you choose to go for an MS , aim for MIT , Stanford , Caltech , Columbia , or even Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute . America is far more willing than Canada to hire foreign engineers . Also the taxes are lower and your starting salary could range from $ 30,000-80,000 per year . In Canada , a very high percentage of your salary will be taxed . Do n't believe the hype about Canada . THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT FIND YOU A JOB , THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT GET YOU A HOUSE OR THE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY LIKE ADVERTISE IN THEIR PUBLICATIONS . TRUST ME , aim for AMERICA .

"Why Santa Claus is dressed is red ? Santa in his red/white garb was propagated many years before the images produced for Coke.In 1822 , Clement Clarke Moore , an Episcopal minister , wrote a long Christmas poem for his three daughters entitled , `` An Account of a Visit from St . Nicholas . '' Moore 's poem , which he was initially hesitant to publish due to the frivolous nature of its subject , is largely responsible for our modern image of Santa Claus as a `` right jolly old elf '' with a portly figure and the supernatural ability to ascend a chimney with a mere nod of his head ! Although some of Moore 's imagery was probably borrowed from other sources , his poem helped to popularize the now-familiar idea of a Santa Claus who flew from house to house on Christmas Eve—in `` a miniature sleigh '' led by eight flying reindeer , whom he also named—leaving presents for deserving children . `` An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas , '' created a new and immediately popular American icon . In 1881 , political cartoonist Thomas Nast drew on Moore 's poem to create the first likeness that matches our modern image of Santa Claus . His cartoon , which appeared in Harper 's Weekly , depicted Santa as a rotund , cheerful man with a full , white beard , holding a sack laden with toys for lucky children . It is Nast who gave Santa his bright red suit trimmed with white fur , North Pole workshop , elves , and his wife , Mrs. Claus .",0
"What is Rational Unified Process ( RUP ) ? how does it relate to project management ? RUP is a standardized software development process . It had its origins in the unified modeling language .

IBM recently donated part of its RUP intellectual property to the open source community . See link in sources for more info.The second part of your question is a little harder . How RUP relates to project managment is that RUP is a process . It defines the steps to be taken to produce a product and it defines the deliverables to be produced at each phase .

"i am an undergraduate seeking for admission into any of the universities ? there are two main ways of getting into a university . the first is to apply directly to a `` four year university '' . in order to get into one of these directly you will need to turn in SAT scores from highschool , along with your highschool transcripts . getting into a university this way is more competitive and it will be harder to get in when compared to the second way . the second way to get into a four year university is to first go to a `` community college '' . at community colleges you will normally do all of the `` general education '' classes that you would have taken anyway at the university during your first two years . once you have finished your G.E ( general education ) you can then apply to `` transfer '' into a four year university having already finished the G.E requirements . if you follow this way you will not need to turn in SAT scores or highschool transcripts and it will be easier to get into a university . aside from it being easier , it is also cheaper to go first to a community college since they are cheaper and will provide you with the same credits that you will be doing during your first two years at a university .",0

DO NOT OVERPAY YOUR WRESTLERS you just starting to get in the business and alot of small feds have gone out of business because they overpay.You have to eat too , start paying about $ 10 a head but depends on how many people attends your show for example : A . 50 to 100 people=0.00 payB . 101 to 125 people=10.00 payC . 126 10 150 people=15.00 payThis is just a basic round example3 .

"what is the differece between a 5 port router and a 5 port switch ? First you need to know th differnce . To understand the difference between a router and a switch you need to understand the ISO model.ISO/OSI Network ModelThe standard model for networking protocols and distributed applications is the International Standard Organization 's Open System Interconnect ( ISO/OSI ) model . It defines seven network layers . Layer 1 - Physical Physical layer defines the cable or physical medium itself , e.g. , thinnet , thicknet , unshielded twisted pairs ( UTP ) . All media are functionally equivalent . The main difference is in convenience and cost of installation and maintenance . Converters from one media to another operate at this level . Layer 2 - Data Link Data Link layer defines the format of data on the network . A network data frame , aka packet , includes checksum , source and destination address , and data . The largest packet that can be sent through a data link layer defines the Maximum Transmission Unit ( MTU ) . The data link layer handles the physical and logical connections to the packet 's destination , using a network interface . A host connected to an Ethernet would have an Ethernet interface to handle connections to the outside world , and a loopback interface to send packets to itself . Ethernet addresses a host using a unique , 48-bit address called its Ethernet address or Media Access Control ( MAC ) address . MAC addresses are usually represented as six colon-separated pairs of hex digits , e.g. , 8:0:20:11 : ac:85 . This number is unique and is associated with a particular Ethernet device . Hosts with multiple network interfaces should use the same MAC address on each . The data link layer 's protocol-specific header specifies the MAC address of the packet 's source and destination . When a packet is sent to all hosts ( broadcast ) , a special MAC address ( ff : ff : ff : ff : ff : ff ) is used . Layer 3 - Network NFS uses Internetwork Protocol ( IP ) as its network layer interface . IP is responsible for routing , directing datagrams from one network to another . The network layer may have to break large datagrams , larger than MTU , into smaller packets and host receiving the packet will have to reassemble the fragmented datagram . The Internetwork Protocol identifies each host with a 32-bit IP address . IP addresses are written as four dot-separated decimal numbers between 0 and 255 , e.g. , 129.79.16.40 . The leading 1-3 bytes of the IP identify the network and the remaining bytes identifies the host on that network . The network portion of the IP is assigned by InterNIC Registration Services , under the contract to the National Science Foundation , and the host portion of the IP is assigned by the local network administrators , locally by noc @ indiana.edu . For large sites , usually subnetted like ours , the first two bytes represents the network portion of the IP , and the third and fourth bytes identify the subnet and host respectively . Even though IP packets are addressed using IP addresses , hardware addresses must be used to actually transport data from one host to another . The Address Resolution Protocol ( ARP ) is used to map the IP address to it hardware address . Layer 4 - Transport Transport layer subdivides user-buffer into network-buffer sized datagrams and enforces desired transmission control . Two transport protocols , Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) and User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) , sits at the transport layer . Reliability and speed are the primary difference between these two protocols . TCP establishes connections between two hosts on the network through 'sockets ' which are determined by the IP address and port number . TCP keeps track of the packet delivery order and the packets that must be resent . Maintaining this information for each connection makes TCP a stateful protocol . UDP on the other hand provides a low overhead transmission service , but with less error checking . NFS is built on top of UDP because of its speed and statelessness . Statelessness simplifies the crash",0

"What are charter schools ? Charter schoolCharter schools are semi-autonomous nonsectarian public school choice educational alternatives that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional state schools . Generally they are organized by educators , parents , community groups or private organizations with an express purpose or philosophy , and controlled independent of any local school district . Charter schools are generally financed by the same per-pupil funds that traditional state schools receive.In the United States , laws governing charter schools vary from state to state . The legal charter establishing each such school is a performance contract detailing the school 's mission , program , goals , students served , methods of assessment , and ways to measure success . The length of time for which charters are granted varies , but most are granted for 3-5 years . Charter schools are accountable to their sponsor—a local school board , state education agency , university , or other entity—to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract . The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability . They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups , including the sponsor that grants them , the parents who choose them , and the public that funds them . Charter schools can be closed for failing to meet the terms set forth in their charter.OverviewThe term `` charter school '' started in the U.S. , but many of the related ideas such as granting greater autonomy to local schools , independence from local school boards , and operating under a charter , have existed in and out of the U.S. for some time . Charters allow publicly funded schools to act and operate more like private schools , but still have public obligations that private schools do not have . Some charter school advocates believe that competition from charter schools provides choices to families , which will force the other public schools to perform better.The concept of public charter schools was first proposed by the Citizens League , a Minnesota political lobby group . The first charter school opened in Minnesota in 1991 , and as of the 2005-2006 school year , more than 3,600 charter schools are in operation in 40 states and the District of Columbia , enrolling more than 1 million students ( National Charter School Directory , The Center for Education Reform ) . Charter schools reflect their founders ' varied philosophies , programs , and organizational structures , and serve diverse student populations.Charter schools are commonly founded as schools for students that may not be served well by traditional public schools in their communities ( such as pregnant teens or teen parents , drop-outs , and other at-risk populations ) or those with special educational needs . Some provide a `` niche '' education , providing a strong focus on dual languages , technology , or the arts.Critics of charter schools claim they may siphon off the best students and leave regular public schools worse off . Supporters argue charter schools have been more likely to serve disadvantaged student populations . Many charter school administrators and parents argue that charter schools serve those students who are not getting their fair share at public schools . Most charter schools in big cities focus on Title I students.Opinions vary as to the success of charter schools , in part because of the philosophical outlook taken , and in part because—as may be expected—such schools vary one from another in quality , competence , and effectiveness .",0

According to the Official 2004 NCAA Basketball Statistics Rules , an assist has to be `` a major part of the play , '' which either finds the player already with a `` positional advantage '' , or helps him or her get one .

You really do n't want a lawsuit due to improper bulding techniques . I would highly recommend having a architect involved with the build . He is not cheap but could provide many ways to lower cost . Right now steel is the cheapest framing materials . Instead of brick you could use siding or maybe stucco . You will have to use sheet rock . Acoustical Tile drop ceilings are good and absorb sound . Central HVAC will be cheaper than wall hung units . Plumbing - purchase the low end of well know suppliers .

First start with builing up distance ... walk 1-3 miles . Once you are comfortable with that- work on your speed . Slowly your walk will be a fast walk , and then eventually a jog .

He also would come in dressed appropriately with the timeframe we were studying ( like dressing like a mountain man when we were studying the frontier period ) . He even made out different versions of the same test for students to choose ( like essay form for people good with words and True/False n multiple choice for people who liked that form of testing ) .My world history teacher was friggin hilarious .

Even they can force US to leave the territory .

"Antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria are an example of ____________ ? just fill in the blank ... its for a bio AP assignment ... Boy , am I ever glad I 'm done with high school biology where they ask ridiculous , ambiguous fill-in the blank questions like that . I have a degree in biology and I could n't give you a solid answer . It will be a word that you should have been studying in class.Ie. , Adaptation - mutations that give an organism an advantageMutation - alterations in genetic makeupEvolution - changes in organisms over time due to adaptationNatural Selection - conditions which select adaptationsI would go with adaptation , but no guarantees . The concept here is that as we take antibiotics we kill a lot of bacteria , but not all of them . The remaining few that survive are the `` tougher '' ones , at least ones that are n't affected as much by the antibiotics . These remaining bacteria may continue to grow in numbers . If they ever succeed in infecting more people , the antibiotics will now do nothing.P.S ... A lot of people think that bacteria randomly mutate until one of them becomes resistant . This is only part of the story . Antibiotics almost always originate from other bacteria , or some other organism trying to fend off bacteria . These antibiotics are not new , just new to medicine . Bacteria have been resisting these antibiotics for millions of years . Maybe not actively , but somewhere in their past it has probably been encountered . Yet another reason why a one-word answer just does n't cut it .",0

It can be used as a salt substitute for food , but due to its weak , bitter , unsalty flavor , it is usually mixed with regular salt , sodium chloride , for this purpose to improve the taste . Medically it is used in the treatment of hypokalemia and associated conditions , for digitalis poisoning , and as an electrolyte replenisher . Brand names include K-Dur® , Klor-Con® , Micro-K® , and Kaon Cl® . Side effects can include gastrointestinal discomfort including nausea and vomiting , diarrhea and bleeding of the gut .

You just plugin one function into another function where there 's an X.g ( f ) means use function G and plugin function F to replace the X1 . g ( f ) =3-2x f ( g ) =2 ( 3-x ) =6-2xI just replaced 2x with x for g ( f ) and 3-x for x for f ( g ) Use this method to figure out the rest.Notice that it says `` x is not equal to whatever '' .This just states that it will be undefined if it is that number and for now , should be ignored as all problems will have real answers .",0

"Do Publishing Companies Enforce Copyright Infringement Lawsuits ? I have a friend who was selling solutions manuals on ebay ( PDF files ) and ebay stopped the listings but not before he sold several manuals . My friend is not a bigtime operator and did n't know the copyright laws . One of the publishing companies recently sent him a letter telling him that he commited piracy and that they could sue him for LOTS of money and possibly even have him pay for their law fees . However they also said that they would give him 10 days to accept a resolution in which he would pay the companies all profits derived from the manuals and an additional $ 100 dollars for legal costs incurred to date . If my friend does not accept the resolution will the publishing company file a suit ? Can they really ask for an additional $ 100 dollars ? My friend would love some advice ... preferably from somebody familiar with the law . Thank you ! Ignorance of the law is no excuse and no defense . The oopyright statement is WRITTEN RIGHT IN THE MANUALS your friend was selling ! As they have access to the records of the sales via eBay , and know who did it , yes , they will most likely pursue to matter thru the courts to seek satisfaction if your friend does not cooperate . They are not just being mean , but they need to protect their property , whether it was one copy or one million copies . It was not your friend 's property to sell , and the profits he made from the sales should be restituted to the company , as well as the amount they had to expend to get the money back .",0

"Why do i do bad things when i know theyre bad , but i cant stop ? Why do i tell myself ill stop smokin , or poppin pills , or dealin or any of that , but i always end up doin it again ? Things like that sometimes seem easy to do , and get away with , but the repercussions can be burdensome . Also , they tend to glue you into a mindset and a lifestyle that may not be the best for your future . Putting yourself into active things , oftentimes using your body instead of your mind , is a good way to lose those feelings that can creep up on you and tempt you . A job , a hobby , a group , frienships , family time , are all good avenues . Sometimes leaving a situation you are in is a viable alternative , with friends , groups , etc . Life is not perfect , so finding a way to not feel totally out of whack when they happen can keep you level-headed . Forgiveness also keeps you from feeling like your carrying the load around with you . Also , the take some of that edge that we all fell like we are the most important thing around , and putting more selflessness , doing things for others even when you might not feel like it , can adjust your attitude toward feeling less alone . Guard your mind , what you put in it , or what you allow others to put in it , because this will affect how you think , and what you think about . Positive action is often the best thing for emotions that want to burst . How you act affects how you think , and vice-versa . In time , they become more a part of what you are and , hopefully , what you want to ideally become . Keep a your head up . Best to you !",0

"How can I start a prison ministry in my church and have it remain safe for children ? Your church should already have guidelines of who should be allowed to be near the children .

We return their children directly to the parent and do n't just let the children loose to roam the church grounds.With rules and guidelines in place , a prison ministry should be fine .

"why are banks for coins called piggy banks ? In Middle English , `` pygg '' referred to a type of clay used for making various household objects such as jars . People often saved money in kitchen pots and jars made of pygg , called `` pygg jars '' . By the 18th Century , the spelling of `` pygg '' had changed and the term `` pygg jar '' had evolved to `` pig bank . '' This name may have caught on because the pig banks were mostly used by children , and the pig is a child-friendly shape that is easy to fashion out of clay . The actual origin of the name bears no relation to the pig itself.What also helped to start the change from jar to pig was during the 18th century , an order of 200 `` pygg '' jars was sent for by a shop owner . The person on the receiving end of this letter did not understand and hand crafted 200 coin holders that were shaped like pigs . When this order was received they were shelved and sold very quickly . The new pig shaped coin holder became popular . Once the shop had run out of stock , they sent off for more pig-shaped coin holders .",0

Among them selves they make really sadistic and some times down right dirty jokes about their current relegious scholars , leaders , but never about any prophet . Be it Moses , Jesus , David , Abraham , Solomon or Mohammad . Any muslim who makes a joke or insults any relegious book or prophet or God , automatically becomes a non muslim.To respect and pledge faith about all prophets is a must in Islam . If any one makes a joke about the prophet of Islam , of course the muslims will react . Other than that I have had the chance to work with Hindus , Sikhs , ( in fact we used to live in the same house ) , Buddhists , Christians , and many others , I do n't remember a single incident when we did not get along . In fact we were and still are good friends .",0

"What is the best music creation software to use for a windows xp computer ? I want a computer program that lets me make new songs by adding beats and sounds and lets me make remixes to songs from my library on my computer . It depends on how much you want to program your own sounds verus leveraging pre-canned loops and samples culled from the songs you want to remix.I 'm still a big fan of Acid -- - Orignally from Sonic Foundry but now a product offered by Sony Music : http : //www.sonymediasoftware.com/products/acidfamily.aspAcid is excellent for working with loops -- it allows you to easily time-stretch loops and transpose them to work well with other loops culled from other sources . A lot of what makes people love Garageband ( Apple 's entry-level music software ) was first pioneered in Acid . The main limitation of Acid is that it has limited or no support for the creation of your own original sounds and sequences -- it 's more of a loop arranger.Another outstanding application is Propellerheads Reason 3.0 ( http : //www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/ ) Reaon gives you an entire virtual rack of synthesizers , samplers , and effects that you can intuitively connect with virtual patch cables . Every knob is designed to be twiddled in real time and the best thing is that all these modifications can be recorded for playback or fine-tuning.Finally , a third application you might want to check out is Ableton Live ( http : //www.ableton.com/index.php ? main=live ) Live is extremely popular among performing musicians today because it is optimized for live performance or on-the-fly creation/arranging of songs . The application is a bit like Acid in that it is mainly intended for working with building blocks of pre-created loops ( either instrument loops or sampled material ) with an interface and workflow that makes it very easy to add , subtract , and tweak stuff as the rest of the song plays back . Between the 3 applications I 'm sure you 'll find something that work for you . Best of all , you can download free trial versions of all applications to see for yourself . Happy remixing !",0

Or are you looking to name your company ? I 'll respond to the latter ... The naming of your business could be one of the most important decisions you will make . A name 's originality and legal availability will create a real asset value of its own , as it becomes marketed and gains market acceptance . The name you choose will become the focal point of all the benefits and features that relate to your product or business . Customers will be able to find and refer others to it in the future . Established products or businesses realize the value of customer good will . A well chosen name will provide an extra marketing advantage , that may mean the difference between failure and success . Companies go to great lengths to trademark and protect the usage of their name .",0

"Since reparations has been given due to past crimes against humanity should n't African Americans receive also ? Due to slavery and 400 yr+ of oppression also the unequal treatment of blacks in America due to White supremacy and injustice . Reparations in the United States have generally been limited to the survivors of government harm . Watch your terminology , though - slavery was not a crime until 1865 , since the government permitted slavery and only outlawed it through the Thirteenth Amendment after the Civil War.For instance , the United States paid survivors of Japanese internment programs from WWII . The program , however , was limited to survivors . No survivors of slavery exist today.A current reparations program would be too bizarre to fathom . All African-Americans were not harmed by slavery , after all , since some immigrated to America after slavery , or since some have no slave ancestors . It would be virtually impossible to require proof of slave ancestry , and then to divide some sum proportionately.Additionally , the vague `` 400 yr+ of oppression '' is unhelpful in crafting legislation . Slavery ended . Segregation did exist also , that 's ended for over 50 years now . If you 're problem with `` White supremacy and injustice , '' then I 'm afraid that no amount of money will solve the problem . Instead , educating future generations and winning over hearts and minds is the most effective remedy to injustice .",0

"Why do some states still have barbaric ways and have the death penilty and others do n't ? I notice that there is still legallized murder in some states and none in others . How can a civillized government allow this to happen in any states ? The short answer is that we live in a Democracy and death penalty laws are on the books because people ( or their representatives ) put them there . There are usually four distinct groups of people involved and it cuts across party lines . Large groups favor the death penalty and large groups oppose it for any number of good reasons . Small groups who have lost someone to murder believe that the death penalty is `` too good '' for the perpetrator , but are not allowed to take the law into their own hands . Small groups related to the murderer oppose the death penalty because of shame and the fact that they still love the perpetrator and find good excuses for him/her.On top of all that , sensational murders committed by those who expect to escape punishment spur on society to support the death penalty . Crimes against innocent children are particularly heinous . And news that someone convicted of murder has been proven ( by DNA tests ? ) to be innocent show the weaknesses in our judicial system.The question really is not all that simple . In New York state , the results of a close Governors race was likely determined on the death penalty issue . The winner favored the penalty while the incumbent never used it based on personal beliefs . Changing politics will always be involved . Many will always feel that a barbaric murderer should know that he/she might face a barbaric fate . And some feel that might save innocent lives .",0

what did you think about HAMAS politics ? Hamas is playing the hardliner approach and they play on the long furstration of the Palestinians . They also have a policy of growing their followers from when they are infants .

"How do you like President Bush ? ? ? He 's a power hungry , cronyist puppet of the far right neocon movement . He 's a demagogue , and he is n't very smart . He thinks he 's above the law , he panders to the prevailing winds of evangelical Christianity even though the neoconservative movement stinks to Heaven of nihilism , egocentrism , atheism and cynicism.He is the choice of a party which tries to expound , at every opportunity , on the evils of big government and centralized social programs all while racking up a monsterous deficit on missile defense shields born of broken treaties . Upon breaking our nuclear proliferation treaties , we wonder why rogue nations in the rest of the world want to do the same . His spendthrift attitude is causing inflation , and it 's crowding much needed private investment out of our manufacturing sector . His failure to enforce the laws which keep the capitalist system of this country running have led to price gouging of fuels , and that 's compounding our economic troubles . Under his administration , we have made several cuts to energy subsidies for the poor ( which he promised not to do while campaigning ) , and in the face of his carefree attitude towards the illegal activities of the oil companies , people have frozen to death in their homes.The manufacturing in the military-industrial sector combined with a purely reactionary attitude towards environmentalism has led to a toxic level of perchlorates in the breast milk of almost ALL of the women tested for it . We ca n't even set up a control group because everyone is so laden with perchlorates . Perchlorates cause brain damage in nursing children.His budgets allocate federal funds for private , religious organizations.In violation of the due process of the law and our long held principles which prohibit unlawful search and seazure , he has the NSA spy on Americans and subpeonas search engines to find out what everyone in the country is searching for.He abandons science in favor of ideology . He refuses to heed the warnings of climatologists . His hostile attitude towards medicine and biology is threatening the very foundations of American industry , innovation and science . His cronies are trying to censor and suppress scientific journals which give sound evidence to something that should be intuitively obvious -- logging does n't help forests recover from forest fire.He was an alcoholic and a cokehead until he was 40 . His `` choice '' to become President was made when , according to him , he realized that he `` was 40 and wondering what to do with his life . '' He is in office only because Americans have strayed so far from their liberal founding principles that they would rather see a dynastic succession of aristocracy than a government of scholars and public servants.He abandoned Afghanistan , where the terrorists were and are , to take us to war in Iraq , where they are n't . He lied to do this . After doing that , his administration gave no-bid contracts to Halliburton , whose former CEO is now your vice-president . The price of doing this is that we are now unable to deal with a growing threat in Iran , and while only a few years ago we were berating the international community and the UN Security Council , the best we can now manage is to threaten to refer Iran to the UN Security Council.Under his administration , we have begun to use the CIA to fly people who are only suspected of something to old Soviet facilities where we torture them . We hold people for long periods of time without charging them with a crime.He pushed an energy bill through congress which relaxes the efficiency requirements for coal burning power plants . His reason ? To correct an impending energy crisis by making it worse . Companies wanting to build nuclear reactors are guaranteed a loan from the government to do so , they are no longer liable for nuclear accidents , and if their inspection process is halted for any reason , the government hands b",0

"Is it ever okay to get a divorce in the eyes of God ? What if you married an aethiest or an agnostic ? What if your husband beats you to a pulp continuously ... and there are kids involved ? What if your husband is cheating on you ... and wo n't stop ? Are you just supposed to stick it out because of the vows you took ? ( This really is n't a personal experience question so I do n't need advice on how to go to a woman 's shelter or anything ) . Although I am answering from a Catholic perspective , the theology is fairly universal.Jesus forbade divorce , except in cases of adultery . However , a divorce also implies that there was a marriage . This tends to be the angle that the Catholic church approaches the breakdown of a legal marriage , and that is , `` was it even a marriage ? `` Marriage is , as Jesus puts it , `` when two become one flesh '' , people whom God himself has `` joined together . '' A sacramental moment of that magnitude requires that people enter it with full consent , and that consent requires both the personal maturity to give that consent as well as having all the information needed to make that consent . Take abuse , for instance - abuse implies a kind of marital fraud . Nobody would knowingly start dating someone who they knew was going to beat them , right ? An abusive person is always going to put their best foot forward at first and hide that aspect of themselves until a time when they feel safe to let it out . This is a fraud - and if a person marries such a person , they are n't doing it with that full consent of the will necessary for a marriage to truly exist.So a civil divorce may not always be a wrong thing to do , if it really is more of an annulment of a marriage that never truly was.Also - the other thing to keep in mind , is that what Jesus specifically condemned was divorce and remarriage , not divorce alone . So even if the marriage was valid in the eyes of God - i.e . abuse , lies , fraud , alcoholism were n't part of the breakdown , it was a valid marriage - it is only remarriage that he 's actually condemned.An aside : marriage was not created by the state . It long predates the state . Marriage was deeded to the state by religion ...",0

"would ypu prefer win 98 or XP ? It depends on 2 things : what kind of hardware you have and what sort of things you do with your computer.HARDWARE : It is safe to say that most PCs sold today can carry the weight of WinXP , plus the load of MS Office XP/2003 and browsing Internet . But if you are still using a 5 or more year-old PC with 128MB or less RAM , you are better off using Win98 . Another issue you might need to know is that whether the PC comes with any USB socket ( which is very common nowadays but not before 2000 , not in developing countries anyway ) and whether you want to use it if it does have one . WinXP makes it easier to use USB devices , whereas Win98 does not comes with any USB driver . ( A 3rd-party native USB driver for win98 can be found at http : //rapidshare.de/files/1217842/nusb22e.exe.html ) WHAT YOU DO : First off , if you are to play any current PC games , go for WinXP . If you are to do any kind of graphics intensive applications like any of the Adobe family software , video editing and encoding , CAD/CAM system , etc. , all of which require a lot of memory size , go for WinXP ( since it can address a higher RAM size ) . If you need an EASY ( without installing any 3rd-party driver ) way to transfer files from and to USB devices ( like flash drives , digital cameras , mobile MP3 players , mobile harddisks , etc . ) go for WinXP . If you only need it for typing some documents/letters , browsing the web , and listening to audio CDs , you can stick with Win98 . If you have some legacy software written to run on Win98 only ( such as customised accounting package ) , stick to Win98.Of course there are many other more specific issues can be considered , but the above can serve as a basic guideline . I hope this help .",0

"How to test a prophet in the LAST DAYS - if he or she is true or a false ? See , i 'm newly converted and I read that GOD WILL POUR OUT HIS SPIRIT IN THE LAST DAYS on all flesh ? Is he gon na pour it on an unbeliever too ? since God says in `` ALL FLESH '' , your children will dream dreams and your daughters and sons will prophesy before the terrible day of God Almighty . So now , JESUS also made mention of FALSE PROPHETS . And our church has a prophet exclusively of their own.There has to be true prophets also in the Last DAYS as well with false prophets ... So which one is which ... ( Hope it 's OK i ask too many questions : ) hi.. First of all , I would like to congratulate you for choosing the way of Christ.I 'll try to answer your question to the best of my ability.I believe that when God speaks about All fleshin Joel 2:28 `` And i shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh ; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , your young men shall see visions . `` He meant the believers or someone who is being prepared for the Lord 's works.If you check sub chapters before that verse , God talks about A call to repentance and the land refreshed.The Lord obviously speaks about the people who repent and refreshed into the new creation in Christ ( believers ) .Thus , I conclude that All flesh , in Joel 2:28 , means All believersThat 's why it is important to always read at least a chapter or two before and after the verse.For the bible works as a whole ; we should avoid reading bible verses by chopping it individually . If we do that , there is a chance for us to take the verse out of the original context . And , yes there are still prophets appointed by God.and as it is true that there are true prophets , there are also false prophets/teachers.and your question is How we can tell the true from the false one , right ? there are 3 steps for us to know that a prophet is a false one or not:1 . God says `` My People perish from the lack of knowledge . '' It is very important for us to read the bible and pray everyday to build a sweet and intimate relationship with God . And also sharpen our knowledge about God 's characters.We know that Jesus has warned us about the false prophets/ messiahs in Matthew 24:24-28 . So , when there are news about messiahs that come to deliver us from sin , we knew that we have to be careful with those fake messiahs . We know in our heart that Jesus Christ is our only messiah that no one comes to the Father without going trough Him.2 . From reading the bible everyday and become more and more alert and sensitive to God 's voice , we knew that the true prophet sent by God will NEVER contradict the bible.So , when a teacher/prophets come to you and said that he is the messiah or something like you should divorce your husband , we know immediately that this prophet is a false teachers and should be avoided.Remember ! the bible is the ultimate guide that you should use to check whether a prophet is false or not.when they go against the bible , do n't waste your time.Pack your things and go.. Do n't bother listening to them.3 . What if the prophet looks and sounds fine for now ... but in the future , he will finally shown his true self . how do you know that he 's not going to trap you in his web of lies . For we know that the devil is cunning and deceitful.Well , go and look in matthew 7 : 15-20.It is okay and even recommended to test those people.Do n't accept them immediately just because they said they are prophets.Do n't be rude to them , but keep your Spiritual alert system on all the time.Test the fruits and the labors . For the things that came from the Lord always bring forth peace and goodness.Take whatever good and biblical inside . but , disregard the weird teachings . Keep alert and pray all the time for the Holy Spirit to reveal the truth to you about those prophets . Hopefully that helps , In jesus name , Amen",0

However , our government of the last several decades has created and perpetuated an entitlement society . By creating a 'safety net ' that attempts to ensure the welfare of everyone ( no matter how unproductive they choose to be ) , we have turned immigration into a burden that drags upon our nation .",0

"Are there 2 Full moons this month ( december ) ? I read a blog that someone posted that siad that there was a blue moon this month , meaning that there were 2 full moons . The blog siad that 12/31/05 was a blue moon . Is this true ? All I can find is that 12/31 will be our second NEW moon , not blue moon . Nope it has to be 2 full moons . Not 2 new moons . There 's only been one full moon this month . there will be , however , two new moons . one was on the 1st and the other will be the 31st ... . the full moon happened on December 15th.A `` Blue Moon '' is the name given to the second full moon in a calendar month . Because there are roughly 29.5 days between full moons , it is unusual for two full moons to `` fit '' into a 30 or 31 day month ( and impossible to fit into a 28 or 29 day month , so February can never have a Blue Moon ) . The saying `` Once in a Blue Moon '' means a rare occurrence , and predates the current astronomical use of the term , which is quite recent . In fact , Blue Moons are not all that rare , on average there will be one Blue Moon every 2.5 years . After 1999 , the next Blue Moons will be in November 2001 ; July 2004 ; and June 2007 . The last one before 1999 was in July 1996 . The term Blue Moon is believed to have originated in 1883 after the eruption of Krakatoa . The volcano put so much dust in the atmosphere that the Moon actually looked blue in color . This was so unusual that the term `` once in a Blue Moon '' was coined . However , Blue Moon was also used in much the same way we use the term `` Harvest Moon '' . There were twelve names for full moons , one for each month , and the name Blue Moon was used in years which had 13 full moons . It referred to the third full moon of the four occuring between an equinox and solstice in that year . A misinterpretation of this led to a Sky and Telescope Magazine `` Star Quiz '' in July 1943 followed by an article in March 1946 which stated that the second full moon in any calendar month was called a Blue Moon ( attributed to the 1937 Maine Farmers ' Almanac ) , and this definition has now become part of the language . In January and March of 1999 , we had a situation which only takes place about four times a century : two Blue Moons occurring in the same year . The last time this happened was in January and April of 1961 and it will not happen again until January and March of 2018 . A double Blue Moon most commonly occurs in January/March but is also possible in January/April or January/May and only when there is no full moon at all in February . It is also possible to have a Blue Moon in December of one year and March of the next year , again , there is no full moon in the intervening February . That might have been way more info than you wanted , but now you know ... and knowing is half the battle .",0

For example ... If a person with bipolar attacks or kills somebody its not well planned and would be obvious to authorties who was responsible for it . Because of the nature of bipolar disorder ... the person would eventually `` come back to reality '' . Now as to psychopaths who are `` serial killers '' ... by the time somebody had claimed enough victems to be labeled as such , would be experienced and `` rational '' enough to know not to behave in a way which would indicate their guilt for murder or any other crime . Many people who have a tendancy towards psychosis are very intelligent people , ironically.lizzie borden is an example of `` impulsive '' .. as I already mentioned.. she killed her parents with an axe.. she wasnt a serial killer.. and from my understanding of the story.. they probably deserved it..by the way..

Iran says they want nuclear power , to be a developed country . But it 's not necessary to have nuclear power to develop . Many European countries or the neighbour Arab Emirats , are more than developed wihtout nuclear power . A military strike would be the worse option . If they want to have nuclear power or even nukes , they should , like many other countries , even with dictators do . Only because they do n't have a good relationship with Israel or US , it should n't be banned . If in 10 years they dare to attack someone with nukes , they will be easily smashed back .

"What is the law on assault on minors in Virginia ? I have a 17 yr old boy and his 14 yr old girlfreind harrsing us . It 's the same as everywhere ; you or your b/f hurt her , you go to jail unless it 's self defense and you 'd better be able to prove it . I 'm a former police officer and if you attacked her , I would arrest you . What you need to do is to talk to the girl 's parents . She sounds obsessive and that can be dangerous . You need to document every offense , possibly video tape her doing it or recording her with a hidden tape recorder , which , in Texas , you can legally do as long as one party in the conversation is aware that it 's being taped , i.e . you or your boyfriend talking to her . If she shows up at your home , call the police . If her parents refuse to put a stop to it , go to the school principal if you are all in the same school and if need be , the police but do not lay a hand on her unless she attacks you . Where do you think sympathy might lie in a court of law ? With you and your b/f who are older , or what they would consider a child misbehaving ? Right or wrong , sympathy will be on her side because of her age . You both have to be the mature ones in this case . Do n't try to solve it on your own .

"What should one do to gain respect in society and also for himself ? plz answer other than- `` give respect take respect '' I think it could be a mistake to `` gain respect in society . '' Society can screw itself . If you `` need '' society 's respect , they have power over you . Do you want to be in that situation ? ? ? ? Only you can truly know if you are worthy of respect . Whether they in society respond to you with respect can sometimes be in error . Some of the most respected people , say in a corporate work situation , are complete idiots -- not worthy of any respect at all , yet they are shown respect for all the wrong reasons . And who in society do you want respect from ? If you want respect from hip-hop rappers , then get some gold teeth , grab your crotch liberally , and wear pants that are falling to your knees . If you want respect from slimy salesmen , go work at a car dealership and make the most bonus of any person that week ... .Do you want respect from people in the local church ? That works great until you disagree with one of their beleifs ... ... ... The most important thing is that you become a person who respects himself -- regardless of others . That is truly of value . If you are looking for respect as a commodity , to be used as a tool for getting stuff from people , then I poo-poo it.So you need to define what qualities in yourself are worthy of respect . Curb the habits and things about you that you do n't respect , or accept that some things will never change and you are who you are . It will be a mix of both -- each of us is different , so you might as well embrace it .",0

"There are two Beliefs of Christ in Judism , What are they ? The newest technique used by Christian missionaries and other Christian Clergy , is what they call learning about `` The Jewish Roots of Christianity . '' One might think this means how , in their opinion , Christianity began with Jews , or developed from Judaism . However , this is not what they mean by `` the Jewish Roots . '' The way they show that the roots of Christianity are to be found in Judaism is that they put a Christian theological interpretation into a Jewish ceremony or ritual . Then they claim that this planted Christian theological interpretation , having been `` found '' in something Jewish ( because it was planted there by them in the first place ) , shows that Christianity came from Judaism . This is nonsense , and shows the lengths they will go to , in order to obtain for themselves Jewish legitimacy.You must understand that both Jews and Christians use the word messiah , but the meaning of the word is different in each faith.The Christian understanding is that the Messiah , Jesus , died for the sins of the people . The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin . But we are taught in our Bible that no one can die for the sins of another . In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin . [ Deuteronomy 24:16 ] God is not a man , that he should lie ; neither the Son of Man , that he should repent : hath he said , and shall he not do it ? or hath he spoken , and shall he not make it good ?

Why do people cut and paste 4 pages into the answer box instead of answering themselves ! ? I hate losing the best answer to someone who pastes half a book from some other website when my answer is the same but coming out of my head . Anyone else think cutting and pasting is cheating / plagiarizing ? Well there r different types of quiz masters here - some of them need detailed information regarding certain subjects ; certain others who r trying to test others ' general/specific knowledge ; certain others who r just time wasters ; some others who really need help - sympathisers ; and of course certain half cracks ! People cut and paste long answers because they are 'long ' - they do not have the time to type it - they could help other genuine quizzers . Further some of the answers are easily available on the net - for such people the best answer is just a link or even more punishing - copying & pasting it so that they are forced to read it !,0

"Why ca n't I lose weight ? First off I am type 1 diabetic and have been since I was 10 , that may have something to do with it . I exercise very regularly .

I follweed them to the tee and did n't lose one ounce . What am I doing wrong ? ? ? If you always do the same workout , your body adapts . Try mixing it up a bit . Try adding intervals into your workout on the elliptical . Crank up the resistance or the speed for 5 minutes , then recover for 5 minutes , and repeat . Or try different equipment for variety . Try the treamill , bike or stair climber some days . Mix up your resistance workout , too . Try pushups and tricep dips for variety . Do hammer curls instead of normal bicep curls . Try some new ab exercises , too.Also mix up your diet , too . Eat a variety of fruits and veggies . You can also vary calories from day to day : 1800 one day , 1500 the next , to keep your body guessing .",0

Height generally varies little between people compared to other anthropometric measures , usually exceptional height ( variance from the average of around 20 % ) is due to gigantism or dwarfism , but height normally falls within a certain range known as a normal distribution ( bell curve ) .

"Why does acidophilus have to be refrigerated ? What about the kinds that supposedly do n't have to be refrigerated ? And what 's up with enteric coating ? And do I ask too many questions ? Acidophilus needs to be refridgerated because it is a bacteria . Since it is a living organism , in order for it to stay alive , they have you bring it down to a temperature that basically `` immobilizes '' it so it does n't die . They do sell those that do n't have to be stored that way , but all the information i 've read suggests that they do n't really work the same as most of the bacteria are dead by the time you take them . The enteric coating prevents the bacteria in the pill from being released into your stomach and thus digested ( killed ) . Instead it passes into your intestines and is released there , which is where the acidophilus bacteria are meant to be living , so it is best that they reach there alive ! No , you do n't ask too many questions ... as long as they are valid .",0

I suggest not going without an Anti-virus software ; if you can find any software that 's legit , then use it .

hair products and skin prouducts ? wat r the best hair products 2 use 2 get my hair thick again its already long and wat about skin i have some littelblack dots from bumps and i need them 2 go way and dont like proactive As far as skin goes : Try the Mary Kay skin care line with customized skin care products for acne . The best thing to with your skin is always to keep it clean as well as treating breakouts . This helps prevent breakouts . There are five steps to basic skin care : 1 . Cleanse2 . Exfoliate3 . Tone/Freshen4 . Moisturize5 . ProtectThe Mary Kay 3 in 1 cleanser can do the first three steps in one . The fifth step is protect . You want to use an oil free foundation which our formulas for dry normal combo and oily skin are all oil free . When your skin is protected with foundation you can wash off the impurities that your skin catches in the air . The foundation catches the irritants and impurities instead of them getting into your pores causing further breakouts . Mary Kay is satisfaction guaranteed . So if you try it and it doesnt work for you you can get different products or your money back . Also it is so important that when you are using skin care you use one line be it Mary Kay or Avon or a Walmart brand . They are formulated to work with one another . Mixing products not designed to work together can cause reactions in some people . ; ) To even out skin tone you of course need to keep your skin exfoliated but also use a solution like our day and night solution . The day solution has SPF 25 in it and the Night Solution has Vitamin A and E and more in them . These collagen inducing products help to tighten and firm the skin as well as even out tone . You can add in our Microdermabrasion once or twice a week to totally exfoliate and remove dead skin . The second step of our microderm set will return your skin to its proper PH balance so you will not be rough or dry afterwards . I reccomend using products as follows but all skin care must be customized for an individual.Timewise 3 in 1 Cleanser ( customized for skin type ) Timewise Day Solution ( at night use Night Solution ) Timewise Moisturizer ( customized for skin type ) Timewise Firming Eye creamAdditional moisturizers if needed ( intense for dry spots etc ) Foundation ( customized for skin type and shade ) Color products ( use all oil free and non-comedogenic ) Hope this was helpful ! !

"who is the president of armenia ? Robert Kocharian ( Armenian : Ռոբերտ Քոչարյան ) ( born August 31 , 1954 ) is the second president of the third republic of Armenia.Kocharian was born in Stepanakert , Nagorno-Karabakh , at that time a region of the Azerbaijan SSR . After becoming president of Nagorno-Karabakh in 1994 , he became Prime Minister of Armenia in 1997 . In April 1998 , he replaced Levon Ter-Petrossian as President of Armenia.He was a Communist Party official during the Soviet era but is no longer a member of any political party . Under Kocharian , Armenia has experienced stability and growth and the emigration rampant under Ter-Petrossian has been reduced . He has also taken a realistic stance in the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.His re-election during 2003 was marred by allegations of electoral fraud against both candidates , though most experts contend that any irregularities were not enough to sway the outcome . There were sporadic calls for Kocharian 's resignation in early 2004 with opposition-led demonstrators taking to the streets in support of demands for a referendum of confidence in him.Kocharian and his wife , Bella Kocharian , have three children .",0
"why should aperson lose their job for forgeetting to turn in money that they are told to keep in their pockets My daughter was a very dedicated employee at Dayton International airport , went to work on her off days just to help out , did whatever her job duties call for her to do , a very repectful young lady that spent six year in the US Army . Nine months in Iraq . She was fired from the airport because they are told to keep money that they collect from customer in their pocket until the end of the day , instead of having a cash box for them to put the money in as soon as they collect it . She forgot she had the money in her pocket three times and took the money home ; therefore they fired her . Although she took the money back each time . She had been working there for one year and that is all they could find to fire her for . She really need her job she have a 4 year old daughter that she is raising . She have bills each month . it 's a shame when young people choose to get out and work and not be on public assistant to get fired for something like that . it 's hard to find jobs . I think it 's sad that your daughter lost her job at the aiport , she sounded like a very dedicated employee willing to go the extra mile even on her days off . But it is probably best she is no longer there because what you are describing here is that she was probably long past exhaustion each time she accidentally took the money home , although I am certain the airport did n't consider this when they decided to fire her.On the WHY part of your question : When she first was employeed by the airport she probably signed an agreement of `` if I mishandle money in any way that is n't in agreement with the airports rules , I understand that is grounds for dismissal '' If she agreed to these terms and broke them , is was their call to be understanding or not . They were 2 times before , but when they see a pattern of it , they are less likely to trust their money is safe . They will protect themsevles before protecting her.I agree they should n't make it so easy to leave your shift without turning the money in first . Just like with waiters and waitresses , or bartenders that most of the time must carry change on them , if the airport had an end shift report to do before each employee was allowed to leave , then it could all be resolved . I do n't know any waiters or waitresses that can leave for the day without giving the company their money first , along with reporting their tipped earnings for the day.Her honesty in giving the money back is something to be proud of , and she should n't hold bad memories against the airport for their descision . She made a mistake , we all do that once in a while . She 'll find another job , and she will have this experience to learn from .",0

"Pisces+Pisces . Any good war/success stories out there ? My girl and I were born 2 days apart . We are pretty much mirrors of each other , so it 's hard getting through conflict as we 're acting out the same stuff . Still , we 've been making it work for 4 years now . Anyone out there with LONG TERM experience ? PISCES + PISCESwhen two pisceans join together in a love match , there is a union of two sensitive and emotional people . they share honest , efficient communication , a rich emotional bond and a deep spiritual connection . they both feel that their precious relationship is the most wonderful thing in the world , and it could n't get any better . they share a love of beauty and peace unparalleled in the zodiac , and both are equally committed to maintaining this ideal relationship . the passive pisces nature affords this couple peaceful times . however , pisces can be too easygoing , sometimes gullible , and is extremely sensitive to negative energy . two pisces together can become lethargic , lazy or bring out the best and worst in one another . they are often unable to set limits for themselves or others , and can wander off too far in a spiritual direction . pisces tend to elude any conflicts with a disappearing act , either with unrealistic optimism or by hiding out in a life of fantasy . it is this typical pisces flexibility that makes both easy to talk to , adaptable to any situation and great friends as well as lovers . pisces is ruled by the planets jupiter and neptune . pisces share a great sense of ethics and values and live life with a philosophical outlook as reflected by the planet jupiter . neptune is in charge of pisces 's relationship with pop culture , abstract thought , imagination and mystery . pisces is a sign of service . each partner showers the other with affection and totally adores any they receive in turn . the giving of fancy gifts , breakfast in bed and weekend getaways are common occurrences in a pisces-pisces relationship .",0

Many newcomers club include a book club . There may be some factors that may not apply to you though . For example : you must be a local to the area for less than five years . To find a newcomers club near you use your internet search engine and type the name of your local area followed by the word `` newcomers '' . For example if you live in Portland you would type in `` Portland Newcomers '' . You may also want to check your local library for other great book club options .,0

"Where are my virgins at ? Anyone choosing not to have sex these days ? Any thoughts ? Well I am a 17 year old abstinent girl , and there are n't many people out there choosing not to have sex . Where did all the virgins go ? ? What are your thoughts on being abstinent ? Hi there , I know that the pressure of being a virgin is extremely hard for one to handle , especially in the Western societies that we live in ; but virginity is worth striking for . I 'm in my 20s and the group of friends that I have is also in their 20s and we are all virgins . I think the most important thing that one needs to keep in mind is that virginity is for ONESELF , not for anyone else ( or sometimes you might wan na save it for you future husband ) . Once you are determined about it , it would be less difficult when you think of whether to have sex or not . My friends and I choose not to have sex before marriage b/c we see SEX as LOVE , and we respect our body as well as our partners ' . When you love someone unconditionally , you do n't just want to own the physical body , do you ? ? Moreoever , when one has premarital sex , the wedding is not something that precious and special anymore , do n't you think ? ? ? What is it special about the wedding night if you 've already know everything about the other person ? ? ? I also have friends who had sex in their teen years and most of them regreted later on . Most of them lived for the moment and after that , they are the ones who `` loose '' . Plus , when we are in our teenage years , we do n't really know what love is ! ! ! Believe me , when you find the one who really loves and cares for you , he would n't might if you want to save sex for marriage . ( My bf and I both compromise on that , and we 're pretty happy ) . Hope you find this a helpful ! ! Good luck !",0

"Will unfounded domestic violence charge hold up in court in Va ? My husband and I were arguing in our apartment and the neighbors called the police . We were alreay in the process of `` making up '' . The police came and interviewed him and visualy saw marks on me from the `` making up '' . The police arrested him for domestic violence and said that the state of Virginia would charge him for it not the city . They never took a statement from me nor pictures . From the time my husband got arrested to his release back to me took 45 min . He litterly walked in the back door did some paperwork and walked out the front.What are the odds that he will be found guilty with only the testamony of the officer and me testifying and telling my story in defense of my husband in the state of Va. You know , I suspect you 're not going to get many takers on this one . You 've got a lot of issues here that are very involved and nobody who knows what they are talking about is going to be able to give you an answer based on the `` facts '' you 've presented here.Rather than try to answer your question , let me ask you some more : What do you define as arguing ? Was it strictly verbal or was there any physical touching whatsoever ? Were any threats of any kind made during the argument ? You said the police saw marks on you from `` making up '' ... which , frankly , is very suspicious to an old cop like me . But the question is , what kind of marks ? Are you talking about a hickey or a bruise ? When the police interviewed your husband , what did he say ? Did he perhaps admit to doing something that would have violated the law in your state ? And please - if you did not personally hear the interview between your husband and the police , you do not *know* what was said ... you might know what your husband told you later , but if you did n't hear it for yourself , you do n't know.Do n't know if you 're asking a question about the city or the state prosecuting , but if you are : not unusual for the state to prosecute a domestic violence charge , even if the victim denies it or changes their story later.If you told the police the marks on you were from `` making up '' , then they did take a statement from you . Once you said that , the police may have felt that was all the statement they were going to get out of you - especially if the marks they saw were not consistent with what you said was `` making up '' ( for example : most people do n't make up by leaving bruises , swollen lips , scratches , black eyes , etc ... if those are the marks you 're talking about , I 'm with the cops on this one ) .If you had marks , the police certainly should have taken photos of them . Some types of minor injuries do n't show well in photos ( especially depending on the equipment ) so they may not have thought photos were worthwhile or they just simply did n't take them . What were your `` marks '' ? You 're asking what the odds are that he 'll be found guilty based on what you say is the officer 's testimony and your statement in defense of your husband . Ca n't answer that one because neither you nor I have all the facts , I suspect.What did the neighbors say ( or more importantly , do the neighbors have something to say ; did they hear threats , did they hear physical violence , did they hear you say something that would suggest you were being victimized ) ? What did he say ? Maybe without meaning to , he admitted to a crime . He would n't be the first person to do so ... and if the cops were skillful interviewers , they may have obtained an admission or confession from him without him realizing he was doing so.What is the crime of domestic violence in Virginia ? You were smart to include that you 're in that state because it certainly makes a difference ( and unfortunately , I 'm not from there ) .Do the police know you and your husband ? Either of you been arrested for domestic violence before ? Bottom line : way too many `` what-if 's '' for anyone to give you an educated answer to your question . Depending on the answers to the questions I 've asked , the chances of him being found guilty could be very good , or very poor.And finally : I 've investigated domestic violence crimes for over 18 years as a police officer . I hope everything you wrote here is absolutely true ... that you were not the victim of domestic violence , and that you are as safe today as the day you were born . I hope nobody ever lays a hand on you , threatens you , or abuses you . However , what you 've written here ( and what I suspect your answers to some of my questions might be ) is some of the most commonly-expressed statements I 've heard from domestic violence vi",0

"Why oil , ghee , butter and fried food is restricted for a daibatic , while they do not contain sugar ? Because everything you eat turns into glucose .

Protiens and complex carbohydrates turn to glucose slowest . So , eat lots of green veggies , beans , whole grains and lean meats and strictly limit or just do n't eat white flour , white rice , potatos , sugar , honey , corn syrup etc.If America were to eat like they have diabetes , this country would n't have as many over weight people who just might become diabetic !

"How do you configure a tunnel ? I want to create a secure tunnel between two sites . They both have internet access and fixed IP adresses . What hardware and configuration do I need ? Thanks for your help Hey ! Great question ... What you are referring to is a VPN . Typically a VPN consists of a minimum of 2 pieces of hardware , configured to accept each other 's incoming traffic and ( un ) encrypt that traffic . If you do NOT already have a firewall on both ends now is the time to get them ! A good firewall will provide adequate , secure VPN services as well as NAT/PAT/etc.There are so many brands and feature sets I wo n't recommend a particular one . However , the first things you need to do are:1 ) Become familiar with what a VPN does exactly ( look at Cisco 's site for a really good primer ) 2 ) Decide what you want to do with the VPN . If you are looking at just accessing e-mail or simple file transfers that 's great . But if you want to get into running applications ( such as accessing an Access MDB ) over the VPN I think you will be quite disappointed . This is , of course , all dependent on your connection speed.3 ) Research some hardware by looking at both Professional and User reviews ( but remember to take them with a grain of salt ) ( Check out CNET.COM for hardware reviews ) . Be sure to pay particular attention to the type of encryptions it is capable of using . If you can , get 3DES encryption as it is the current industry standard and is relatively quick so it wo n't impact performance.4 ) Determine your budget for both ends , and do n't forget to include installation costs if necessary for the other end from where you are ( if you ca n't get there easily ) Also , if you have dedicated Internet connections ( such as Frame Relay or other type of T-1 ) you can call your ISP and ask if they sell a firewall/VPN package that works with your current connection.I just got through setting up a new VPN for my business so I could work from home , and with a T-1 circuit it 's pretty slow . So we use a Remote Control package on dedicated PC 's to do most of the work . This way only screen shots , keyboard and mouse controls are being passed . Not only is it blazing fast , but the remote control software adds an additional layer of encryption to the data being passed . Nothing like encrypting your data 5 seperate times for security ! Good look , and welxome to the world of VPN 's !",0

"While teaching grammar to students of English , are we allowed to use their mother tongue ? or English alone ? That 's a good question . Most countries that employ native English speakers to teach English do NOT want the teachers to speak anything but English . This can be beneficial for the students because they are literally flooded with English and have no resort but to learn as the days go by . It is akin to learning through immersion - which , from experience I can say is the best and easiest way to learn a language . If it 's all you hear all day long , you pick it up fast.However , it can be very difficult and daunting for students to hear only a language they have n't yet learned . When I taught English in Thailand , I could only speak English to them because I had n't yet learned Thai . But once I had enough Thai under my belt to speak to the students in their own language , it made it a LOT easier to make them understand the English I was trying to teach.So there are advantages and disadvantages to both ways . Just do your best and see what works .",0
"Why is American tax day on April 15th ? Who started the day and why is n't on that specific day ? And how many years has it been that way ? The Sixteen Amendment which allows the enforcement of taxes was passed by Congress on February 13 , 1913 . They chose March 1 , 1914 as the filing deadline for taxes . This deadline was changed to March 15 in 1918 , and in 1955 it was changed to April 15 . `` According to an IRS spokesman , the move `` spread out the peak workload , '' but there 's another explanation . Turns out that as the income tax applied to more of the middle class , the government had to issue more refunds . `` Pushing the deadline back gives the government more time to hold on to the money , '' says Ed McCaffery , a University of Southern California law professor and tax guru . Still , the IRS 's rigidity works in your favor : By law , it must mail your refund within 45 days or pay you interest . ''",0

"Intel Pentium Processor upgrade ? I have a Compaq Presario 3020 Desktop PC with Intel Pentium processor ( 166 MHz ) . I would like to know if I upgrade the processor and put in a faster one ? And if so , what processor ? Also how do I open ( take the cover off ) the Compaq Presario 3020 Desktop PC ? You could upgrade the processor . The highest processor you can upgrade to is a Pentium 233 MMX ( the last model before Intel moved to the Pentium II format ) . It 's not much of an upgrade but it 's up to you if it 's worth the time to learn how to do it . Money should n't be a probably as the 233 MMX probably goes for $ 5 or less on ebay or some flea market.To open the Presario case , there are probably some screws on the left hand side in the rear ( when looking directly at the front ) . They secure the left panel to the case and consists of two ( maybe three ) screws . If you tug at the left panel by pushing it towards the back and it still does n't open , it might be a U-shaped cover and you 'll need to unscrew the screws on the right panel on the rear . Again , this may vary as different vendors had different ways to take the cover off . I know that Sony desktops at the time did n't use screws but had pressure mechanisms that held the panel in place .",0

"To Christians- Who created God ? If God created man , animals , and everything else , then who created God ? I believe that is the same type of question as where did the matter in the big bang theory come from ? In accordance with the physical laws of this universe , it is impossible for the matter in the big bang theory to have come out of nothing or to have just always existed . It is impossible for something to come out of nothing ... I 'm sure you agree with this . Also , the universe is expanding , which indicates that it had a beginning point in time . So you 're question appears to be , `` If it is impossible for the earth to have always been in existance , how is it logical to believe that God has always been in existance ? `` The thing is , we know that the earth had a beginning and that it is impossible for it to have just come about on its own by the physical laws of this world . But if God created everything ( which I believe He did ) , then He is not bound by the laws He created . He made up the laws of physics . How could He be limited to those laws ? We can not think of God in terms of our physical world . God made up the rules , therefore God is not under the rules . He is eternal . The world which He created is not . Here 's another thought I 'm just going to throw out here , even though it does not go right along with your original question . If you believe that you have a soul or a spirit , or if you believe in any type of spirit beings , how could these have come about by purely by physical means ? Can spiritual things come from physical things ? If this world only came about by matter and not by God , how could matter produce spiritual things ? `` For by Him [ Jesus ] all things were created : things in heaven and on earth , visible and invisble , whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities ; all things were created by Him and for Him . He is before all things , and in Him all things hold together . '' Colossians 1:16-17 ( [ Jesus ] was added by me for clarification of the pronoun Him . )",0

Its like a home , every home needs a specific address so that the postal system can forward postal mail . Earlier routers ( as the one that you have ) may not allow multiple IP allocation so you may not be able to use the router with multiple computers .

"Do you believe its right that we are helping Iraq when they bombed us , but we will not even try to help mexico I am just wondering because my StepFather is Hispanic and he has took me to Mexico , the United states tells hispanics to get a green card if they want to come hear , but how when they ca n't even make enough to buy food ? Granted there has been many incidents with hispanics they are just trying to feed there family like many of us . You 're assuming that we are actually helping Iraq . I do n't think we 're helping Iraq . I do n't think we should be `` helping '' Iraq . In fact , the U.S. has a very poor track record `` helping '' other countries . More often than not , the other countries end up worse off than before.Allowing unlimited Mexicans to enter the U.S. is not going to help Mexico or Mexicans . It will simply depress the already depressed economy in the border areas , and in metropolitan areas farther north.Nor will having the U.S. just throw money at Mexico help for more than a very short time . It may feed people for a short time , but it wo n't improve the economy . Mexico is poor because it is poor in natural resources , especially in arable land . The only way to improve the economy is to either improve the natural resources available or find ways of providing valuable goods services to entities outside of Mexico so that money is flowing into the country .",0

"american culture values ? Interesting question .

America ( both as a continent and as the US of A ) is home to so many nationalities that one might get lost in trying to find what American culture is about or what being an american really is.So my opinion is that multi ( or pluriculturalism , not sure which is best used ) is the identifier here . At least it should be , because an environment which harbors such diversity should promote understanding , empathy and coexistance for those cultures which are part of it , something that the USA declares itself to be upholding , but its internal and external policies seem to disagree .",0

"Are American Indians really sovereign , and should they be Americans ?

So yes technically American Indians or more precisely the various tribes are the first people here and thus should be sovereign and even ruling the white man not vice versa as it is . They have more right to be called Americans than the rat tag bunch of colonials that arrived here and started a wave of slaughter and massacres such as the force eviction of tribes along the trail of tears , force evacuation and settlement of reservations , gifts of smallpox infested blankets in an effort in biological warfare , broken treaties and senseless wars and killings .

"Who ran the fastest forty ever at the combine ? A couple of my guesses would be Deion , Darrell Green , maybe even Mike Vick . Also , who do you think ran the fastest forty ever ... .not just at the combine . There is no official world record for 40 yards.The shortest distance that the IAAF , track and field 's international governing body , recognizes for world-record purposes is an indoor 50 meters , or about 54 yards . It is 5.56 seconds and it was set by Canadian sprinter Donovan Bailey in 1996 . There is also a world record for 60 meters -- 6.39 seconds by American Maurice Greene in 1998.But it is another Canadian , Ben Johnson , who is believed to have run 40 yards faster than any human in history . Johnson is best known for injecting copious amounts of steroids and winning the 100 meters at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul in 9.79 seconds , only to have his gold medal and world record stripped after failing a post-race drug test.Timing officials have since broken down that famed race into 10-meter increments , and Johnson was so preposterously fast that he went through 50 meters in 5.52 seconds and 60 meters in 6.37 -- both under the current world records at those distances . He went through 40 yards that day in 4.38 seconds.He was running in spikes . . . on a warm afternoon perfectly suited for sprinting . . . with a slight tailwind . . . with years of training from arguably track 's top coach , Charlie Francis . . . with Carl Lewis and six others of the fastest men on the planet chasing him . . . with 69,000 people roaring at Seoul 's Olympic Stadium . . . with hundreds of millions of people watching on TV . . . with the ultimate prize in sports , an Olympic gold medal , at stake.And , as we learned later , with muscles built with the assistance of the anabolic steroid stanazolol.Four-point-three-eight seconds.Then again , maybe Ben Johnson is n't the fastest 40-yard man in the world.Maybe half the NFL is faster.o o oIt can be the most important few hours of a football player 's career . It is the day NFL scouts come to campus to determine whether prospects have what it takes to play at the next level.Players are measured to the quarter-inch . They 're weighed to the half-pound . They do a vertical jump and a standing broad jump . They see how many times they can bench-press 225 pounds . They do a 20-yard shuttle drill and something called a three-cone drill . They are put through a short workout specific to their position.But it is something else that commands everyone 's attention , something else that interrupts the businesslike atmosphere of players shuffling from one station to the next . Something else that causes scouts and spectators to snap to attention.The 40-yard dash.It is the day 's shortest event , and the most critical . No other statistic carries more influence for an NFL prospect , no single number has more impact on his draft fortunes . It 's not called Pro Scouting Day or Pro Prospect Day or Pro Workout Day . The sign taped to the weight-room door at San Diego State on March 19 says : `` Pro Timing Day . `` Or as local football agent David Caravantes puts it : `` There 's football speed and there 's 40 speed , and the scouts will all tell you they understand that and game film is the most important thing . But how many defensive backs who ran a 4.6 are left on the draft board ahead of guys who ran 4.3 ? `` I 'll give you another example . There 's this DB who was originally projected as a first-rounder . But he did n't run the 40 that fast -- something like 4.6 instead of in the 4.4s -- and now they 're talking about him slipping to the second round . Well , he 's looking at a minimum $ 4 million signing bonus if he goes in the first round and only about $ 1.6 million if he goes in the middle of the second round . `` You do the math . `` The players are inside the SDSU weight room being measured and weighed .

It does have a 24pin though which I can not figure out what it goes on.Any suggestions ? Do I NEED both of them or just the 4pin ? You do need both . The power supply you have is a later version of the ATX form factor . Basically , your power supply has more pins because it 's made with the later standard . Your motherboard is probably fairly old and/or basic . In any case , you should be able to plug the 24-pin plug into the the 20-pin socket without a problem ( it should only fit one way ) .

"despite much phlosophies , religion , wise people , why is there much conflicts locally and globlally ? Despite all the religions of the world and their constant advocating of peace and justice , things are pretty violent on the third planet . Religion itself must share some of the blame . All religions tend to cultivate a sense of absolutism : the idea that one is right , and others are wrong , and that 's just how it is . This sort of thinking leads to the next step : if others are wrong and evil , why do the good people have to tolerate them ? From that thought , the bullets begin to fly , and the mass graves are filled up quickly . A famous general once said that a criminal may kill one , ten , or even a hundred people , but only someone who absolutely believes that what they are doing is right , moral , and just will kill millions .",0

"why do farts smell ? So why do farts smell ? Fermented food produces different types of fumes , some of which smell . Flatulence contains odorless gases , such as nitrogen , carbon dioxide , oxygen , and methane , but it also contains the `` oh-so-nasty '' hydrogen sulfide , which causes the smell . If you have not noticed by now , some of the aforementioned fumes are flammable , like methane and oxygen , so you can , in fact , burn farts . Yes , you can set them aflame ; it is not a myth.How much odor is produced also depends on the food you eat . Vegetarians might fart as often as meat-eaters , but their farts do not smell as much because vegetables produce less hydrogen sulfide . The more sulfur rich the foods you eat , the more your farts will stink because bacteria will generate sulfides and mercaptans as they break down the nutrients . Beware : even though cauliflower is a vegetable , it also makes you stinky , so watch out !",0

"What is the best way to develop my piano technique to play pop/rock songs ? I know chords , inversions , etc. , but how do I make what I do with my left hand more interesting ( I tend to just play octaves ) ? Are there any good books/courses that you could recommend ? Well I just started learning jazz piano in the fall to accompany my singing . I actually learned some good rhythm patterns for the standards so far , I know they arent pop or rock songs , but it might help.Some suggestions : In the left hand you can play the root tone ( C7 it would be C ) and then the 5th note ( G ) alternating . So like on the first beat C and then on the 3 beat G. To make it more interesting play the C on the 1 and the 2.5 ( leading to the G ) and then the G on the 3 and 4.5 . ( I usually do that on swing songs , so you play the offbeats right before the next beat so it has that swing feel ) You play the chord in the right hand on the 1 and 3 . ( or in swing songs sometimes on the 1.5 or you play the chord on the 4.5 of the measure before ) Also for the left hand you can think of a bass line , which is a little more complicated . Where you play bass notes on each note according to the chord and you lead it to the next chord . I believe that the notes on 1 and 3 should be in the chord . Im not very good at that yet , so I cant really say much more about bass lines.For bossa ( or a latin feel ) , you play the left hand like my first example but in a straight feel . Then you play the chord in the right hand on the 1 ( 1/8note ) 2 ( dotted 1/4 ) 3+ ( 1/4note ) Another suggestions is to listen carefully to music you like and hear what they are playing . Try putting up the bass and figure out what they are playing exactly in the bass . Then analyze the chords , try playing along . It takes some time and effort but will help develop your hearing and make you a better musician . It might help to get an experienced musician to give you lessons . I would suggest going to jam sessions and finding a piano player you like and ask he/she if they would give you lessons . I really learned a lot in a short time with the help of guided lessons . ( I know some other patterns as well , but they are difficult to explain in a forum , it helps to see and hear them in person . )",0

The only relationship is through marriage.If both couples have a girl ( for ease lets say sally and jane ) then I think that would make them each others cousin , niece and aunt.Sally would be pauls sister and so the aunt to any offspring of pauls . This also makes any offspring of her brother pauls her niece or nephew ( obviously ) . Jane is marys sister and so the same is true , she will be aunt to any of marys offspring hence we have the relationship Aunt and niece for both children to each other . They are also however the grandchildren of each couple . Jane is the grandchild of Mary and John and sally is the grandchild of Betty and paul and since the only relationship I can think of between grandchildren normally is cousins I think this term applies here as well .",0

"What is the best treatment for canker sores ? Any way to promote healing or maybe reduce the pain ? Canker sores usually go away without any treatment .

Other medicines , such as Anbesol , Oragel , Orabase and Zilactin-B , might keep your canker sores from becoming irritated by eating , drinking or brushing your teeth .

After it 's mixed , you can swish a teaspoonful in your mouth for about 1 minute and then spit it out .

"What 's the best diet to loose weith in 1 month ? ? i need to loose some weith ! Any minding of the fat & calories , coupled with adequate exercise , will help you drop a little something.Increase your activity . Start walking , jogging , or biking for 30-60 minutes at least 3 or 4 times a week.Drink like a camel . I try to drink about 15 glasses of water a day , plus coffee ( the extra water is to counter the caffeine dehydration ) .Use a calorie-free sweetener instead of sugar . Try to be active in the morning , and try to eat breakfast . Both will kick-start your metabolism.Get adequate sleep.If you 're a carb addict like me ( bread , pasta , etc . ) , opt for whole grains . I eat whole grain cheerios for breakfast , and use 1 % milk . 1-3 times a day , I eat buttered vegetables ( California or Italian Style frozen vegetable mix from Wal-Mart : 25 calories per serving ) .If you like kool-aid or other sweet drinks , try fruit2o ( fruity water ) , Propel ( fruity water by gatorade ) , or CRYSTAL LIGHT drink mixes . I once traded in my kool-aid for crystal light while I was pregnant , and did n't gain any weight between visits with my doctor.If you want a little help , go invest in a good OTC diet pill like TrimSPA or Propolene . I do n't recommend Stackers , but that 's only because I do n't know many people who can take stimulants the way I do . DO NOT take more than the recommended dosage , and do n't take them too late in the day , or you wo n't sleep.And last ... COMMIT to changing your lifestyle , NOT just dropping a few pounds for whatever happens in a month , and thinking it 's going to be forever . If you can not commit , then do not complain .",0
"What happenes if you default on a 401K loan ? If you fail to pay your 401k loan , then you are taxed on it as if you would have taken a regular distribution . ( Tax + Penalty for early distribution ) .The amount that you owe is deducted from your total 401k amount.For example . If you take a 401k loan for $ 1000 , and you have $ 3000 in your 401k and you quit your job , then the $ 1000 is deducted from your $ 3000 leaving you with a $ 2000 401k total.The $ 1000 is also treated like a `` distribution '' . In other words , it 's treated like an early withdrawal . So at the end of the year , you owe a 43 % penalty on the $ 1000 , or $ 430 in taxes . ( 33 % income tax [ or whatever your income tax rate is ] , 10 % penalty ) .Further more , since that $ 1000 is treated like regular income , it may push you into a higher tax bracket .",0

These rich starch foods are not good for dinner ! * At dinner time , chose mainly large mixed veggies salads ... with fish , lean meat or cheese ( if you are not a vegetarian ) . if u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it . no salt no nothing just plain . u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound . i heard that from a weight loss tape . the best drink is water or gatorade . thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo . if u want a macine . run with dumbells on a treadmill . u could do the rocky workout . but thats a new story . u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs1 ) It is not just the amount you eat , but what you eat . Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start . And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.2 ) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day . Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored . The other half of the time use weights , or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle `` burn '' . A gym is also an option , but I do n't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.3 ) Sleep well . To bed earlier and up earlier . Exercise in the morning when you wake up , not in the evening before bed . 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.4 ) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time . A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.That is a good place to start ... if you see good results , keep it up and modify to fit you ... if it does not , see a doctor AND a trainer Keep working out , drink water a lot , eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities , vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice , fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours , minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important , your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hoursthe most important thing is you do n't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you wantyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.comgood luck",0

"what does high IgG and IgM values mean in immunoglobolin blood tests ? It could be an indicator of an auto-immune problem , or it could be nothing . The test itself having high levels really does n't tell anything by itself . You really need to discuss with your doctor if you have other symptoms , what they are , how severe they are , how frequent , what brings them on , and you would really benefit from keeping a journal of all that information , because sometimes there is so much you forget . Write down anything , sometimes things you think are no big deal can be relevant.If you had other tests taken , you should discuss those results as well . I have SLE ( lupus ) and I know from personal experience that it takes a lot of positive factors and time to determine a person even has an auto-immune problem . You are your own best advocate , so speak up for yourself . In the meantime , check out these websites , they may be able to help with information specific to the condition you are being checked for , support for you and your family , and possibly links to other sites that specialize in your particular problem . Good luck !",0

"when was the first time that butterfly stroke was done swimming ? Would like to know the first time that butterfly stoke was used in swimming and who invented it . In 1934 , however , David Armbruster , coach at the University of Iowa , devised a double overarm recovery out of the water . This `` butterfly '' arm action gave more speed but required greater training and conditioning . Then in 1935 , Jack Sieg , a University of Iowa swimmer , developed the skill of swimming on his side and beating his legs in unison like a fish 's tail . He then developed the leg action face down . Armbruster and Sieg combined the butterfly arm action with this leg action and learned to coordinate the two efficiently . With two kicks to each butterfly arm action , Sieg swam 100 yards in 1:00.2 . This kick was named the dolphin fishtail kick.Even though the butterfly breaststroke , as it was called , was faster than the breaststroke , the dolphin fishtail kick was declared a violation of competitive rules . For the next 20 years , champion breaststrokers used an out-of-water arm recovery ( butterfly ) with a shortened breaststroke kick . In 1953 , the butterfly stroke with the dolphin kick was legalized as a separate stroke for competition . Many swimmers say the `` wiggle '' is the key to the stroke and that a swimmer who can undulate through the water naturally can more easily learn the butterfly .",0

"What is the preferred treatment for a large hematoma on the shin caused by trauma ? The area on the shin is large ( 3 inches by 2 inches ) and very swollen and has n't changed for 3 months . Doctor says it may take 6 months to `` go down '' and that , if not , it may need to be `` drained '' . The doctors are right . I developed one on my shin after a wreck . 6 months later it was flat and only minorly discolored , 8 months later it was no longer painful to the touch and the coloration had gone , 10 months later it no longer hurt to run . It does take a while , I would wait as long as you can to decide to get it drained , because I was told this can be painful . But if there 's absolutely no change in color or size after 7 months , you may want to go for it , cause that 's about when the calcification process starts ( Eventually it will turn hard . ) Healing time also depends on where the hematoma is located . If there is mostly bone and not alot of muscle mass , it may not take as long ( i.e . top of foot , hand , etc . ) In areas with much muscle mass and fat , it may take a long time , because the muscle absorbs all the protein.Here 's what you can do to hurry it a little : Fill a styrofoam cup with water and freeze.Tear the top rim off so a half inch or so protrudes like chapstick.Massage the hematoma lightly with this ice for 15 minutes at a time , 3 to 4 times daily.At night , use some form of localized heat , that can be comfortable and not dangerous or painfull . This will help promote bloodflow in that area.DO N'T rub or massage the area , you may make the area bleed again under the skin , starting you back at day 1.Eat a diet rich in protein.Get extra rest if the hematoma is on your legs or feet.Good luck , I hope this helps you .",0

"Can i adddepreciation expense in cashflow even Der is no accumulated depreciation in balnce sheet.will it blan I am having a problem in forecasting a financial statement about adding a depreciation expense in cashflow even though there is no accumulated depreciaiton in the balance sheet under fixed asset it will not balance on the actual amount , on the other hand if I did n't include the depreeciaiton in cashflow the balance sheet will balance . Can you help me on this ? Depreciation is added into every cash flow statement that I have ever seen where a company has fixed depreciable assets . Since it reduces net income but does not currently rely on the use of cash , you add it back . The purchase of the asset would be handled seperately as a use of cash .

The things I like to do might not be able to be done by a thicker girl . To me skinner girls are hotter . You can check out their figure .

If you feel like she is remorseful about her cheating and says she can change give her one more chance .

Like Americans , they do n't really care , and the questions are not rude ; it is just a standard greeting.Asking about your health was considered slightly rude , since the state of your internal organs was your business . `` How are you '' is the accepted opening question in the US of A and several other countries . It is just a polite greeting . I used to be offended when people would ask me where I was going , when I was in Malaysia . Then I realized it was just the polite greeting for their culture . If , for instance , someone was going to rob a bank , they would not say so . You have probably seen people on crutches greeted with `` how are you ? '' and heard them reply `` Fine '' .If you visit someone in a hospital and ask how they are doing , you expect a long answer . If you pass them on the street , you do n't ; just a polite ( and empty ) phrase .",0

"what 's the difference between sephardics and ashkenazies ? and their origin ? Askenazim are Jews whose ancestors migrated to Northern and Western Europe in the Middle Ages , especially to France and Germany . Due to expulsion from the former and persecution in the latter , they largely moved to Eastern Europe , especially Poland/Lithuania , which was an enormous and powerful country in Renaissance times . They spoke a German dialect that eventually evolved into the Yiddish language . Sephardim were decended from Jews who lived in the Iberian peninsula when it was ruled by the Moors . They were expelled from Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella and moved eastwrd to Greece , Turkey , the Balkans , and other lands . They spoke an archaic Spanish which later became Ladino . Lately , Asian Jews whose ancestry was never European and who had lived in places like Iran since the Roman Diaspora have also started being referred to as Sephardim .",0

If for no other reason than a full stomach interferes with the breathing action of your diaphragm.If you want to know what to eat for you last meal before a long run , carbohydrates are a good bet.A good rule to go by is `` anything that agrees with you when you do shorter runs . Experience will teach you what works and what doesn't.Right now , I prefer fruit juice and bananas before a long run . They have orange juice and potassium and are easy to digest . I have a friend who is known to have gone out on long run carrying a slice of cinnamon toast in each hand . Whatever works.Note : There are people who are gluten intolerant who get craps and diaharea if they run after having foods containing it .

"what happens when you quit a job because of depression ? Can you get it back ? I quit my job as a teacher due to expected bouts of depression . I went to a doctor . I was told by a rep that I had to quit since I was so new . I mean I didnt get formally diagnosed or treated . I didnt want to quit , but I felt it was my only option . I want to be a teacher again in the NYC Teaching Fellows . They said they dont reinstate anyone , however , this was unexpected and it is a illness . With treatment , I can improve . What are the chances that I can plead for my job back ? When you quit a job for any reason , you do n't usually have the option of getting it back just by asking . You will probably have to reapply to the position -- if it 's still available -- and go through the whole interview process again.The only way this situation would have been different due to your depression would be if they had offered short-term disability . I 'm not sure if this was offered , especially since you were new , but this option typically puts your position on hold while you are recovering/going through treatment . However , doing this for mental illnesses is n't always the same as a physical injury/disability , as it 's usually more helpful for a person to keep working and going through a normal routine.Anyway , it seems like you will probably have to reapply to the position . If you were forced to quit though , rather than go on disability , you might have a legal case against them , but this is only a guess .",0

"how many merders happen in new york each year ? 270 during last year.Murders were up slightly nationwide during the first six months of the year , and gang violence contributed to more killings in some of the nation 's largest cities , the FBI reported Monday . The number of murders rose 1.1 % nationwide , while overall violent crime declined 3.1 % . New York , Baltimore and Philadelphia were among the cities with an increase in homicides.The reasons for the increase in homicides vary by city . But experts said there has been a resurgence in gang activity in some of the cities . `` The question is , what are they fighting over ? '' said Kenneth Land , a Duke University sociology professor . `` Is it retribution homicides , or turf wars over drugs , or is it protecting turf ? `` The FBI 's six-month status report , based on reports from state and local law enforcement agencies , is widely viewed as an important indicator of national crime trends each year . The report also is considered a good predictor for the bureau 's year-end crime analysis.The report does not include raw totals for categories of crimes , only percentages . However , the FBI had figures for some large cities.The six-month totals for 2003 marked the third consecutive time the FBI has recorded a decrease in overall violent crimes but an increase in murders.The FBI said there were 308 murders from January to June of this year in New York City , compared with 270 during the same span last year . Philadelphia had 158 murders in the first half of this year — 20 more than in the first half of 2002 . Baltimore had 141 ( 14 more ) and Newark , N.J. , had 40 ( 13 more ) .Officials in Washington declared a crime emergency this summer during a spate of mostly gang-related violence.Overall , there were 4.3 % more murders in the Northeast part of the country during the first half of 2003 compared with last year . There also were slightly more homicides in the South and West ; only the Midwest showed a decrease ( -1.9 % ) .Many major cities outside the Northeast had fewer slayings , the report said . Los Angeles was down by 65 ; it had 258 . Detroit had 156 ( 28 fewer ) and Las Vegas dropped by six , from 70 to 64.Even with the national increase in murder , overall violent crime fell , as it has for most of the past decade . Other violent crimes besides murder that are measured are forcible rape , robbery and aggravated assault.Aggravated assaults were down 4.4 % . Forcible rapes dropped 4 % and robberies less than 1 % . Property crimes dropped by 0.8 % compared with the year before , although motor vehicle thefts were up slightly at 0.9 % . Other property crimes are burglary and larceny.The number of arsons — measured separately — dropped 10 % . Every part of the country saw fewer criminal fires set in the first half of 2003.The nation 's largest cities , those with more than 250,000 residents , saw violent crime drop slightly more than 4 % . The drop was most pronounced in rural areas , however , where violent crime fell 5.7 % . Violent crime was down 1.1 % in the suburbs.The rates for property crime changed very little in cities and suburbs in the first half of 2003 , but rural counties experienced a 2.5 % decrease.All regions of the country showed a decrease in motor vehicle thefts from January to June except the West , where they rose by 7.2 % .The FBI 's Uniform Crime Reports for the first six months of the year are based on information collected from 9,908 state and local law enforcement agencies .",0

"Why is Ram for Dell computers so expensive it is called Rambus ram . ddr ram is cheap in comparison to rambus ? excerpt : Samsung Electronics , the world 's largest maker of computer memory chips , pleaded guilty Wednesday to a charge it participated in a worldwide price-fixing conspiracy that damaged competition and raised PC prices.Prosecutors said Samsung , which is based in Seoul , South Korea , and other companies conspired in e-mails , telephone calls and in-person meetings to fix the price of chips used in personal computers and other electronic devices.The outcome of the investigation also is expected to help fuel a private antitrust case filed by Rambus Inc. , which licensed a memory technology that had been embraced by Intel Corp. , the world 's largest maker of the microprocessor brains of computers.In 1996 , Intel chose Rambus technology to help speed up systems running its then-upcoming Pentium 4.But the chip makers did not want to pay Rambus royalties . DRAM prices fell sharply - so much so that Intel agreed to support non-Rambus technology in the fall of 2001.Shortly after that , DRAM prices nearly quadrupled .",0

"what are nephillims ( ? ) are they the offspring of the fallen angels ? The Nephilim ( fallen ones , giants ) were the offspring of sexual relationships between the sons of God and daughters of men in Genesis 6:1-4 . There is much debate as to the identity of the `` sons of God '' ( see our article on this subject here ) . I believe the correct view is that they were fallen angels ( demons ) who mated with human females and/or possessed human males and then mated with human females . These unions resulted in offspring that were `` heroes of old , men of renown '' ( Genesis 6:4 ) . What were the Nephilim ? According to Hebrew and other legends ( the Book of Enoch and other non-Biblical writings ) , they were a race of giants and super-heroes who did acts of great evil . Their great size and power likely came from the mixture of demonic `` DNA '' with human genetics . All that the Bible directly says about them is that they were `` heroes of old , men of renown '' ( Genesis 6:4 ) . The Nephilim were not aliens , they were literal , physical beings produced from the union of the sons of God and daughters of men ( Genesis 6:1-4 ) .",0
"Does conditioner damage hair ? Does regularly using conditioner contribute to alopecia ( receding harline ) ? *Noddling solemnly* While many disagree I have to say yes , chemicals ( even in conditioners and shampoos ) can damage hair . One should only wash their hair often enough to keep it clean . Daily doses can over do it , especially if you use the rinse and repeat method.Now I can not say if this is the cause of your problem , but beware products that contain alcohol or lauryl sulphate as they dry out hair and make it brittle.Most people routinely lose between 70 and 150 hairs from their scalp each day , mainly through washing , brushing , and combing.Scalp hair starts to thin when more hairs are lost through normal shedding than the scalp is able to renew . About 40 % of the density of scalp hair has to be lost before thinning of the hair becomes noticeable.Hair loss can be caused by : * Heredity . Most balding is caused by a genetic predisposition - in other words , it 's part of a person 's genetic makeup . This is called male pattern baldness , or hereditary balding or thinning . It is the most common cause of thinning hair . * Illness , certain physical conditions , or their treatments . This can include high fever , thyroid disease , childbirth , inadequate protein in the diet , iron deficiency , cancer treatments , the use of certain medications , and other causes.For more see http : //www.ehealthmd.com/library/hairloss/HL_whatis.htmlSome good alternatives are found here http : //www.answerbag.com/c_view.php/1654",0

Life for everyone would be very miserable.And to those out there : sometimes girls need to hide the fact from the family so putting up for adoption is out of question . The family would resent it a lot and force the girl to have and keep the child.Children should be wanted and loved .

"Why are celebs / other useless people paid so much ? Something I really do n't get.Why does someone that looks good ( in the right light and make up ) but does n't have two brain cells to rub together get paid millions for a movie deal ( even if they ca n't act ) ? Why do even dumber football stars get paid even more ? Double if they 've got a paternity suit or killed someone in the past ? Why also are teachers , nurses and other public servants that actually contribute to our quality of life paid so little ? My life is richer when I 'm not watching brainless celebs and sports stars on TV and I could live my life 100 % without any of them . I would not be living my happy comfortable life , however , if it was n't for teachers / nurses and other public servants.Someone help me understand why completely useless dreggs of society get paid so much . Please . A measure of the quality of life is not confined to the 'better ' things in life.Most people feel the need to relax , have fun and dream a little . Sometimes this is a reward for having done well , for others this may be an escape from not having everything they might wish.The argument for paying celebrities / sports stars huge amounts of money is fairly simple . Put those people on the screen / field and huge numbers will pay to watch , replace them with people with 98 % of their 'talents ' and hardly anyone will watch.A teacher or nurse touches the life of hundreds of people , celebs reach tens of millions . Another thing to remember is that having money through celebrity also has a burden . First , on a personal level public adoration is like an addiction , it is very difficult to deal with 'lows ' after the 'highs ' of performing . This is a major cause of the drug dependencies found in non-sports celebs - just look at rock stars.Secondly , 'people ' extract a price for their adoration . Celebrities become public property and have little or no private life unless they are very , very lucky.No celeb ( with any future ) will complain about stuff they need to do while in their public persona . Tom Cruise is a good example - will sign every autograph request at a premiere - he arrives hours early to do so . Julia Roberts explains that she makes movies because she loves it , the $ 25 million fees are for having to put up with the massive media and public intrusion.The intrusion into stars private lives is because of the insatiable appetite that the paying public has for coverage of their favorites.Only the very few very lucky or very litigious stars have a true private life.Finally , money is only function of how much people will pay - supply and demand.If the world only had a few thousand teachers , nurses ( I hesitate at public servants ; - ) ) perhaps they would be the superstars being paid the huge amounts of money ?",0

"Any cure for the Steatocystoma multiplex ? i am currently suffering from this disease from almost 10 years..i am looking for instituation where i can get a possible cure.Appreciating a lot ur help . It looks like treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms.Surgery to remove the lesions may be accomplished with excellent cosmetic results when the number of lesions is few . However , in many cases the number and location of lesions may preclude surgical excision . Draining the lesions with a large needle is also temporarily effective . Oral antibiotics in the tetracycline family have been tried with limited success . Accutane has also been tried with mixed results . Improvement was seen in some patients while in other patients the condition actually worsened .",0

Either you will work through this or the friendship may end . P.S . Try not to be judgemental of his situation , that 's just my personal opinion .",0

It 's very hard to make the `` friends '' to dating transition . You need to let him know that you 're interested without ruining the friendship if he 's not . Do n't pine away or let him walk all over you in the hopes that he 'll start to think romantically about you.If you have a friend that has a close/comfortable relationship with a guy , you should start to go out with them as a `` double date '' without telling your friend that it 's a double date . Tell him that you want to go out with your friend , but you feel funny going by yourself with your girlfriend and her boyfriend . Your girlfriend 's relationship has to be past the early , nervous phase . If not , the nervousness will certainly spoil any hope of getting closer to your guy . After about a month or two , you will know whether your guy wants to get closer . You will have held hands , kissed , etc . If so , start going out alone . If not , just keep it as friends and look for another guy to get close to.Good luck !",0

"where natural digits 0123456789 are coming from ? In mathematics , a natural number is either a positive integer ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... ) or a non-negative integer ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... ) . The former definition is generally used in number theory , while the latter is preferred in set theory and computer science.Natural numbers have two main purposes : they can be used for counting ( `` there are 3 apples on the table '' ) , and they can be used for ordering ( `` this is the 3rd largest city in the country '' ) . The natural numbers developed with some difficulty . The Peano postulates state conditions that any successful definition must satisfy . Certain constructions show that , given set theory , models of the Peano postulates must exist.Peano axiomsThere is a natural number 0 . Every natural number a has a natural number successor , denoted by S ( a ) . There is no natural number whose successor is 0 . Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors : if a ≠ b , then S ( a ) ≠ S ( b ) . If a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every natural number which possesses it , then it is possessed by all natural numbers . ( This postulate ensures that the proof technique of mathematical induction is valid . )",0

"Is there a safe way to invest in a work from home project ? how can you tell it is not a scam ? Work from home is a dream for lots of people because it is convenient and you can be your own boss , but the problem is how do you know that what you are about to invest in is the real deal or just a scam ? The fact that you use the word `` invest '' in the same sentence as `` work from home '' is a danger flag ! Never send anyone you do n't know any money for any such scheme ! How do you know if it 's a scam ? Easy ! It 's always a scam ! ! Here 's what consumer advocate and expert Clark Howard says about the subject : '' The bottom line is that you make money doing something you already know how to do . You set up a business by making phone calls , networking and getting your name out , often times using your current or past employers . Paying money up front should never occur ! If they tell you to pay $ 30 or $ 60 for all of the supplies , it 's likely you wo n't get anything but some more ads from the company . You get into the system with an employer first and then you work up to working from home – not the other way around . You find work the same way you would if you were interviewing for a work-in-the-office job . There are skills you have that you may be able to use in an entrepreneurial fashion from home . You can save a lot of money starting a business from home . So , think about that instead of thinking it will all be provided for you in a kit . ''",0

"why do some people get addicted to drugs and some do n't ? Addiction to drugs and alcohol tends to run in families and may have to do with how the brain processes certain chemicals , particularly those of the `` feel good '' type , which may be lacking or dormant in the addict until they are activated by drugs or alcohol . According to Carl Jung , alcoholic drinking is seen as a reflection of the human need , gone wrong , for a spiritual life . In a famous letter to Bill Wilson , Jung wrote that the craving for alcohol is the equivalent , on a low level , of the spiritual thirst of our being for wholeness , or union with God . Jungnotes that in the word alcohol in Latin is spiritus , a word that describes the highest religious experience , as well as the most depraving poison . In solving the problem of alcoholism , Jung offered the formula spiritus contra spiritum . A figurative translation of this Latin formular is , `` it takes the Spirit of God to overcome the harmful spirit of alcohol . ”",0

"Are you a Calvinist or an Armenian ? Explain why and back up your position with Bible verse please ? Please only serious answers . Calvinist . [ Arminians ] ... say that the Augustinian tradition subordinates the love of God to the will of God ... But this is not what distinguishes the Augustinian tradition from the Arminian tradition . The distinction is between intensive and extensive love , between an intensive love that saves its loved ones , and an extensive love that loves everyone in general and saves no one in particular . Or if you really wish to cast this in terms of willpower , it 's the distinction between divine willpower and human willpower . Or , to put the two together , does God will the salvation of everyone with a weak-willed , ineffectual love , or does God love his loved ones with a resolute will that gets the job done ? The God of Calvin is the good shepherd , who names and numbers his sheep , who saves the lost sheep and fends off the wolf . The God of Wesley is the hireling , who knows not the flock by name and number , who lets the sheep go astray and be eaten by the wolf . Which is more loving , I ask ? - Steve HaysJohn 10:7-9 ( NKJV ) Then Jesus said to them again , `` Most assuredly , I say to you , I am the door of the sheep . [ 8 ] All who ever came before Me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not hear them . [ 9 ] I am the door . If anyone enters by Me , he will be saved , and will go in and out and find pasture . John 6:44 ( NKJV ) No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him ; and I will raise him up at the last day . John 6:45 ( NKJV ) It is written in the prophets , 'And they shall all be taught by God . ' Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me . John 15:16 ( NKJV ) You did not choose Me , but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit , and that your fruit should remain , that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you .

I was a counselor of addicts for three years , however , I concentrated moderately on diet . Be prepared to gain weight most likely , have lack of motivation , and constantly tired .

This development is most obvious in the private , the semi-private and the public sectors and involves the local , regional , national , transnational , and global levels within these sectors .

"what happens if an inmate doesnt die on the first try of the execution stage of a death sentance ? Execution is complete upon the death of the inmate .

The rationale being that he had served his sentence.. executed and pronounced dead.He could n't therefore be sentenced again for no man could be punished twice for the same offence and I believe its what we call 'double jeopardy'.Therefore , if you die and live after being executed ... you are a free man ... but is there such a chance ? : )",0

"can the government really do illegal actions ? for instence ... can the gov . really lie to the public about different things like terrist acts and catasraphies . iv heard theorise that 9/11 didnt happen by commersial airplains and by types of gov . airplanes and that the CIA kidnapes terrorists and takes them to different countries where they have no laws and torchers them and things like that ? dont worry . this information is from reliable sourses which is why i wounder about this . Of course , various individuals within the American government , as well as larger entities within the government have gotten away with crimes . Check out the story of Ruby Ridge . Sara Weaver war murdered by FBI agent Leon Horiuchi 's sniper fire , as she stood on the doorstep with baby in her arms . The FBI also murdered one of her sons and killed the family dog . The government had to pay Randy Weaver 1.5 million dollars for this fiasco , but the government murderer Leon Horiuchi could never be prosecuted . Similar events happened at the government massacre of innocent civilians at the Branch Davidian church at Waco , Texas . Attorney General Janet Reno and ultimately Bill Clinton , were responsible for those murders , but they and all under them were never prosecuted . Our founders knew that government was a beast which would always grow in power and corruption and tyranny , unless seriously counterpoised by an armed and freedom loving people . Thomas Jefferson said the tree of liberty must be watered from time to time by the blood of patriots and the blood of tyrants . Our second amendment rights and inalienable God given rights to keep and bear arms , has been continually eroded by unconstitutional antigun laws . The people have been brainwashed by the government propaganda centers ( public schools ) that the government is our saviour , and that our rights come from the government , not from God , as the Declaration of Independence so clearly stated . Check out JPFO ( Jews for the Preservation of Firearm Ownership , Aaron Zelman 's group ) , which is the strongest gun rights group . The NRA is nothing but compromising antigun hypocrites.Alex Jones and some others believe that 911 was a conspiracy by the illuminati . Hard to tell . But certainly , if passengers on board those airlines had been able to exercise their constitutional right to keep and bear arms , such a thing could n't have happened . I will not fly if I ca n't take my gun . I will not be subjected to unconstitutional searches getting on the plane like some slave dog . I am a free american . The Patriot Act and similar legislation shows that the government is far more interested in using 911 and similar incidents to attack our rights , rather than to go after the enemy .",0
"Is a war with China inevitable ? Please , be specific . I do n't think the US is going to ask for war against China . That 's just stupid . But I think it is very likely that China will force us into War against our will . The teetering balance with Taiwan is just the tip of the iceberg . China has it 's eyes on the entire region -- the entire world for that matter.I think we 're safe for at least a few more years ... maybe even as many as 10 . China has n't finished feeding off of the US yet . They 'll wait until they have more money , more military technology , and they will wait until their generation of all men grows to a good military fighting age . There is a space of more than 10 years where the boys outnumber the girls 13 to 1 . This generation will be more enthused about risking their lives to take over territory that actually has females . It must be understood that this is n't `` inevitable '' just because China has the manpower . It is thought that it will happen because China pretty much says that it is going to happen . China , though it just loves to cater to the US 's cheep labor force needs , is openly anti-American . The students learn about the US as an evil empire . So is it truly `` inevitable '' ? I think the relationship between the US and China could change -- I think we could possibly become friends . But it is much more likely that in the future China will show aggression to the US or the US 's interest that will lead us into war .",0

Please direct me to the scripture where you claim it says `` God made one sun , and one solar system . `` `` Humans traveling to space proves the tower of Babalon wrong . '' The destruction of Babylon was not over how far from the Earth the Babylonians were making themselves . It was about their attitude . Their wanting to build the tower to make themselves equal to God .

Lean muscle mass is simply your weight minus the weight of your organs , bones , fluids and fat . You increase lean muscle mass primarily through eating properly , resistance exercise , and a lifestyle that doesnt promote catabolizing activites ( smoking , heavy drinking and drug use ) 3 . Frequency of meals - the more meals the more the metabolic processes take place in your body and the faster your metabolism.4 . Water Intake - dehydration is a major drag on metabolism.Most people are dehydrated and they dont know it.5 . Sleep - getting enough rest allows the body to function at a higher metabolic level.You will learn more than you ever knew about metabolism from my source .

"I know somebody that does not want to go back to college . He begins to cry and he says he hates it. ? How can I help him ? For some , college can be their first push into independence . It can be terribly hard for those that have not had much experience in the world . Also , for those that have not socialized much before , college can be very intimidating . All of a sudden they are put into an environment where social contact is a constant.I can speak from experience- when first arriving at college I hated it . Roomates , no privacy , it was awful for me . However , when I gave it a little time those roomates that I loathed became great friends . Now the situation that I looked upon with so much disdain is now one of the most treasured periods of my life.My suggestion is to visit him at college . With having someone familiar there it will make him more comfortable . Perhaps help him break the ice with some other students . Also , let him know that he 's not the only one feeling that way . However , he needs to start owning his experience . Let him know that college is a great time to be able to learn and experience everything HE wants . There 's no one there to tell him what not to do . That be scary at first , but when he finally feels what it 's like to be independent , he 'll come around.Best of luck !",0

"What if you are wrong ? Like the song says , What if you are wrong and Christ is the son of God who has died for you and is the only way to the Father . Are you be willing to take that risk without at least searching for the truth ? Is your eternity worth looking into ? But I am not wrong , unless you think the Bible is wrong ! And if the Bible is not wrong , then you should examine your beliefs , and you will come to the conclusion you should convert to Judaism.The place i look to see what i should believe , and to check against to see if other beliefs are wrong is the Bible , the Hebrew Scriptures , and when i check i check in the original Hebrew.Here is what it says , in contrast to Christianity : : : The Christian understanding is that the Messiah , Jesus , died for the sins of the people . The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin.But we are taught in our Torah that no one can die for the sins of another . In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death forthe fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin ( eesh b'chet-o yumatu ) .In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself to atone for the sins of the people . To be written out of Gd 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . Gd 's response is No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : Exodus 32:30-35 And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Etrnl ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Etrnl , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Etrnl said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book . The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for Gd 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd will forgive us.So , the Bible is clear , no one can die for the sins of another , and this means that Jesus can not die for anyone else 's sins.Christians also believe that one needs a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin , that one who does not have such a blood sacrifice will die in their sins , and go to hell , except for the sacrifice of Jesus.This , too , is UnBiblical . The Bible describes blood sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin in the Book of Leviticus . But it is in Leviticus itself , in the middle of the discussion of the sin sacrifices , that we are taught that we do not need a blood sacrifice to be forgiven for our sins . Offering a blood sacrifice was an expensive thing to do for the family offering the animal . Was forgiveness then , to be only for the rich ? No , because if one could not afford a blood sacrifice then one who sins could bring flour , which has no blood and no life as their sacrifice , and Gd forgave them ! Leviticus 5:11-13 ; But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering ; he shall put no oil upon it , neither shall he put any frankincense thereon : for it is a sin offering.Furthermore , read the Book of Jonah . In Jonah , the People of Ninevah do three things in order to be forgiven by Gd . They fast , they pray for forgiveness , and they stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgave them ! This is exactly what we do on Yom Kippur , we fast , we pray for forgiveness , and , hopefully , we stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgives us . And what book do we read on Yom Kippur afternoon ? The Book of Jonah ! Jonah 3:7-10 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Ninevah , by the decree of the King and his noble",0
"Is getting spanked or spanking someone for sex purposes , evidence of mental disease ? The only way it could be considered a mental disorder is if it were forced on somebody .

People who are enjoy spanking and other fantasies generaly confine the activities to the bedroom . Outside the bedroom they 're just normal average people like everyone else . BTW spanking is more common than you think.Cindy you do n't find your `` control '' comment a bit hypocritical ?

"Best food for brain ? What can I eat to be more clever and remember more things ? Oh without question ... Try fish ... It makes a big difference ... you will fill it happen ... increased concentration and improved memory.This because fish contains Omega-3 fatty acids which is an 'essential fatty acid ' . An 'essential fatty acid ' is a type of fatty acid needed by our bodies which needs to be supplemented in our diets as we are incapable of producing it ourselves . Since most of us eat hugely insufficient amounts of such fatty acids , most of us are deficient in it . So adding it to our diets usually fulfils the immediate need for them and makes a big difference . Fatty fish are excellent sources of Omega-3 , but there is some concern about increased levels of heavy metal contaminants in their meat ... so i think it is best and more convenient to supplement your diet with processed fish oils ... which have been purified . Cod liver oil capsules are a popular and easily available fish oil supplement , however are very rich in Vitamin A . Perhaps the best choice left is to consider Fish Body Oil instead of fish liver oil ... if you can get your hands on those . Do consider it ... it 'll really help you out ... .. if you decide on taking cod liver oil ... take no more than one capsule every 3 or 4 days ... just to be on the safe side . Fish body oils can be safely taken every other day .",0
"Considering that Iran threatened Israel to wipe it from map , should Israel bring about a preemptive attack ? Iran has threatened that way for about 30 years and actually nothing has happened.There are some facts that I give you about Iran and Israel , its on you to decide:1 . Its a historical fact , Iranian King Koorosh after conquering Babylon rescued a group of Israelis that was prisoned there , his name is in Jews holy book ( the last part I have heard from a Jew friend ) 2 . Lots of famous Israel leaders born and grew up in Iran , want a sample ? Netaniaho3 . Jews live freely in Iran , no one do any harm to them , they are accepted as a god based religion and they are free to do they rituals and business , even send money to Israel if they want to , they can leave Iran and go Israel but they don't4 . Iran and Israel have n't done anything against each other , maybe cursing is the worst act5 . Although everyone think Iranian is Arabs Iranian are not arabs and they almost hate them specially because of what they have done when conquered Iran , so Iran and Israel have a common enemy6 . Israel have done anti Iraq operations many times , Iraq was Iran enemy ( they were in war for years ) 7 . Iran Nuclear program was at progress for years , Israel could do an operation when Iran was really weak ( After Iran-Iraq war exactly at the time they attack Iraq ) Maybe they yell at each others but they totally love each other ; ) Many hidden strings in Iraq and Middle east are in Iran hands , although Neo Conservatism theories which are at progress specially by UK urges that Israel needs peace and UK is the leader of Middle east politics from old times.So decide yourself , these are the facts that I know .",0

"I want to become cricket umpire , please let me know how i have to start with . Thanks ? I am a professional and an avid follower of the game of cricket . I have this fascination to become a professional cricket umpire and I dream to become a member of the elite panel of umpires of ICC someday . I would like to know how to get started so as to be able to realise my dream . I am not at all aware about the procedure to be followed in this regard . Kindly guide me on the same . Introduction to international umpires and refereesOne of the ICC 's key priorities is to ensure that international umpires and referees perform at the highest standards possible . The ICC appoints the world 's best officials to the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires and Referees and provides an assessment and support system to aid umpires and referees in their development . The ICC has four officiating panels : • The Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires ; • The Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Referees ; • The Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires ; and• The ICC Associates and Affiliates Umpires Panel.The role of a cricket umpire is one of the hardest officiating tasks in international sport and sometimes calls are made for technology to play a greater role in cricket , but the ICC believes it is important not to override the basic philosophy that cricket is a game and human umpires are part of that game . The ICC is committed to trialing technological innovations but technology will only be introduced into the game if it : • can provide conclusive answers ; • is practical to introduce for all international cricket ; • does not compromise the role of on-field umpires ; and• does not change the essence in which the game is played.Becoming a member of the Emirates Elite and International Panel of ICC UmpiresTo become a member of the Emirates Elite or International Panels of ICC Umpires , officials must be standing regularly in first-class cricket in a Full Member country of the ICC.From the list of first-class umpires , each country nominates their two best-performing umpires to the Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires , and their next best to the position of TV Umpire.Members of the Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires are then eligible to be chosen for ICC events such as the ICC Cricket World Cup , ICC U/19 Cricket World Cup and the ICC Champions Trophy.They can also be appointed from time to time to stand in Test matches to provide cover for members of the Elite panel . The ICC closely monitors the performance of these umpires at international cricket . Those that show that they have the qualities to perform at the highest level , may then be invited to become full-time members of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires .",0

"How can I get back together with my ex-wife ? Our split up was due to a really bad situation . No adultery involved . However the tust was shattered ! Not knowing the details , it is tough to answer , but there are various types of women out there , and for some , trust is everything . If you did enough to make her leave you , it must have been pretty bad . I would assume ( since I do n't know the circumstances ) that either there have always been trust issues , or that your infidelity ( of whichever type ) was long standing and ongoing , and so she felt betrayed . In both cases , I do n't know if there is anything you could do . If she left because of pure emotional reaction , you might have a chance , but if it was an intellectual decision , it is not likely to work . Emotion can be reasoned with - an overreaction can be dealt with , but logic is usually rock solid . You could offer therapy for you both , however if you are already 'divorced ' , it seems a little too final to try that . Apologies alone wo n't really get you anywhere . Not much of an answer , but without any details , it 's the best I 've got . My main advice though is to know when to give up . Some battles ca n't be won . At some point , you might have to just count your losses , consider this an expensive learning experience , and do n't make the same mistake next time .",0

"Why is DSL never available in my area ? Why is DSL never available in my area ? DSL has a distance limitation , and this is most likely the reason it 's not available in your area ( it 's not available in my neighborhood either ) . For DSL to work properly you have to be less than 18,000 or so wire feet away from your telco 's central office . If you are too far away they wo n't offer it . There are technologies to extend it , however , most of the telco 's ( Verizon and AT & T ) are switching to fiber networks . Verizon is going to go with fiber to the home and AT & T with fiber to the node . When those roll outs are finally completed , you 'll probably be able to get vdsl ( very fast dsl ) in your area . Might take a few years though .",0

Atheist is a general statement about a non belief in any God concept.Hard Atheist : This is the person who says that God does not exist , affirmatively.Weak Atheist : This is a person who does not feel that there is any quality evidence for the existence of God . They do not rule the concept of God out definitely , but they see no reason to believe in any of the Gods they know of.Agnostic : Agnosticism is not a position on whether one believes in God or not , it is a position on whether one believes that it is possible to know positively whether God exists or not .

I have friends who are completely uptight ( in my view ) and have to have everything planned out to the smallest detail . I do n't drop in on them unannounced . It really shakes up their world for some reason.There are no hard rules . Over generalization is the hobgoblin of this society . Remember , one size fits all , fits all equally poorly . Some people like myself would love to be surprised by an old friend . Other people would be so shocked by any alteration of their plans that they would suffer real physical anxiety over not being prepared to “ entertain ” guests . Whatever . Depends on who you 're dropping in on and how well you know them .",0
"phases of themoon ? The Moon appears to go through phases . In other words , the amount of the Moon that we can see changes over time in a cyclic period that repeats itself approximately once a month . ( The actual period of this cycle is approximately 29.5 Earth days . ) The cause of these phases is the relative positions of the Sun , Earth , and Moon . As seen in the diagram , if the Sun is located off to the right of the picture , the Earth and Moon are illuminated as shown ( the white areas being the lighted areas ) . Notice that no matter what phase the Moon is in , HALF of it is ALWAYS lit by the Sun . ( Which half is always lit ? The half that is facing the Sun . ) The reason that we do not always see a Moon which is half lit is because of our position relative to the Moon and the Sun . As the Moon moves in its orbit , different portions of it appear ( to us ! ) to be lit up as we look at it from Earth . This is why we see lunar phases .",0

My wife says it was just a crush and nothing physical . I 'm not sure this is the truth , since she lied about everything else , until I found out for myself . Lying is part of the Affair . First print a hard copy of the BLog , and all Emails for future referance . Chances are it has gone farther and she is covering it up . The only way to get through the lies is to catch her in the act . I suggest you contact a private investagetor to look into the matter , They have knowledge and resourses that you would not have , plus by having a third party you get honest information and not biased based on how you feel . Now if you learn that she is not cheating , `` yet '' then I suggest you work on the relationship before she does . I would suggest you seek help in counciling . Your not going to be able to resolve the issue by yourself . She is looking at other men probably due to an unmet `` NEED '' at home .

"Where , when , and why did the Holocaust happen ? Come on , if you are hoping for an easy answer to your homework , in several minutes you will have all the wikipedia links you could ever want on this subject . If you are hoping for non-attributable material in essay form , you wo n't get it here.Answers ... The Holocaust , meaning the Nazi German program to eradicate `` undesirable races '' like Jews , Gypsies and Slavs , happened primarily in what is now known as Poland and Germany , although one could argue that the round ups and other terror spread throughout most of occupied Europe.The rough period of the Holcaust varies depending on opinions . I rather believe it started with Kristalnacht on November 10 , 1938 and did n't end until 1945 with the final liberation . Survivors and their familes might tell you that they still suffer , therefore it has n't ended.Why is more complicated . I would read `` Hitler 's Willing Executioners '' by Daniel Goldhagen for a fairly succinct answer . However , it was the result of Nazi Germany 's effort to `` purify '' the `` Aryan '' ( what toff , as though they were Aryan ) race by killing off the so-called `` sub-humans '' .",0

"what are the reasons of diabetes ? how can it be prevented , and best practices to aviod this disease there are two types , type 1 and type 2. type one is a defect with your pancreas , which is usually diganosed before puberty . there is no way to prevent type 1. type 2 is completely preventable . type 2 is the most common , something like 98 % of the cases , and this is caused by being overweight . there has been a strong link , where if it runs in your family , you are more suseptible to it . the best way to prevent this is to stay close to your ideal body weight . this can be calculated by the equation : For males : Ideal body weight= 50 + ( 2.3 x Height in inches over 5ft ) for females : IBW= 45.5 + ( 2.3 x Height in inches over 5ft ) These give your weight in kilograms , to convert to pounds , multiply by 2.2for example if your a woman 5'5 '' the equation would be : IBW= 45.5 + ( 2.3 x 5 ) = 57 kg x 2.2 = 125.4 lbs.If you stay close to your ideal body weight , you have almost no chance of developing type 2 diabetes . For type 2 diabetes , it all has to do with your weight , not what you eat.The reason why you do n't want type 2 diabetes if because there are MANY complications associated with it , including cataracts , blindness , heart disease and amputations , just to name a small few.If you are overweight , find a great support group and lose weight the old-fashioned way , diet and exercise .

"What is Cancer ? Development of cancer , Types of treatment , effects of cancer Cancer is a disease of cells . It is an abnormal growth of cells which tend to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and , in some cases , to metastasize ( spread ) . Cancer is also called malignancy . A cancerous growth or tumor is sometimes referred to as a malignant growth or tumor . A non-malignant growth or tumor is referred to as benign . Benign tumors are not cancer . Cancer is not one disease . It is a group of more than 100 different and distinctive diseases . Cancer is NOT contagious.Cancer can involve any tissue of the body and have many different forms in each body area . Most cancers are named for the type of cell or organ in which they start . If a cancer spreads ( metastasizes ) , the new tumor bears the same name as the original ( primary ) tumor . The frequency of a particular cancer may depend on gender . While skin cancer is the most common type of malignancy for both men and women , the second most common type in men is prostate cancer and in women , breast cancer . Cancer frequency does not equate to cancer mortality . Skin cancers are often curable . Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer for both men and women in the United States today.Cancer is the Latin word for crab . The ancients used the word to mean a malignancy , doubtless because of the crab-like tenacity a malignant tumor sometimes seems to show in grasping the tissues it invades . Cancer may also be called malignancy , a malignant tumor , or a neoplasm ( literally , a new growth ) .TreatmentDevelopments in the treatment of cancer have led to greatly improved survival and quality of life for cancer patients in the past three decades . Traditionally , cancer has been treated by surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation therapy . In recent years immunotherapy has been added to that list . New drugs and techniques are constantly being researched and developed , such as antiangiogenic agents ( e.g. , angiostatin and endostatin ) , genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies , retinoid agents , and vaccine agents ( stimulating the immune system ) .",0

If you do n't need lots of tech support , then get a computer cheaply from http : //www.pricewatch.com There are lots of system builders out there that will sell you a basic computer with Windows XP Home or Pro for a pretty reasonable price.When getting a new computer : Pay a little more ( not too much more ) and get one with 512MB RAM , SATA Harddrive ( It will say SATA ... if it does n't say Serial ATA or SATA , then it is n't SATA ) .If you are n't going to use it for games , then you do n't really have to worry much about the video card .",0

"why is the risk of semen-to-mouth transmission less than semen-to-vagina ? Risk of HIV transmission from semen to vagina is supposed to be because of vaginal mucus membrane absorbing the virus . Mouth surface is also mucus membrane . So why risk of semen-to-mouth transmission is less than semen-to-vagina ? OK , ignoring the overly-emotional responses that some people have had to this question , it actually IS true that semen-to-mouth sex carries less of a risk of HIV transmission than semen-to-vagina . One caveat , though : The risk is NOT zero . Oral sex DOES carry a risk . Smaller , but a risk.Why ? No one has 100 % figured out . However , it is postulated that the digestive enzymes present in the saliva do a number on the HIV virus and are able to knock out a fair amount of the infectious little buggers .

"Why do Christians always compare the best Christians with the worst Muslims. ?

"What are some good ways to stop smoking cigarettes. ? Methods of quittingCold Turkey methodNicotine Replacement Methods ( Patch , Gum , Nasal Spray ) Behavioral MethodsCognitive Therapy MethodOther Methods and adjuncts ( acupuncture , hypnosis , medications ) Factors for relapse while in the process of quittingPredictors of successful quittingCold turkey methodThis is the prefered method used by so called self changers , people who quit on their own and without any nicotine replacement by gum , patch or nasal spray . Little is known about this method as any research study would influence the results as it would no longer be a spontaneous process . Strong motivational factors are believed to play the foremost role in successful quitting using this method.Nicotine replacement therapyIn this method the nicotine delivered by the cigarette is replaced with nicotine delivered through the skin ( transdermal nicotine or nicotine patch ) , the nasal mucosa ( nicotine nasal spray ) or the buccal mucosa ( nicotine chewing gum ) . Several well designed clinical trials have shown the efficacy and safety of nicotine replacement the goal of which is to reduce cravings and ease withdrawal symptoms . Transdermal Nicotine Patches The nicotine patch is usually well tolerated , and provides constant , steady nicotine blood levels throughout the day and night when worn . They are quite simple to use , help prevent weight gain , cravings , and nicotine withdrawal symptoms and are socially acceptable Side Effects of the patch Patches may cause a local skin reaction , and insomnia with nightmares may occur . Overdosing in nicotine is possible , especially if a person smokes while wearing the patch . Smoking while wearing a patch is dangerous and may lead to stroke or heart attack . Use of the patch requires abstinence from tobacco products ... i.e . no smoking or chewing tobacco . Cost Patches are expensive and cost close to $ 100 per month of use . However bear in mind that smoking 1 ppd costs $ 1000 per year , which multipied by 10 years approximates the price of a car . Some people are tempted to cut the patch to save money . Nicoderm is the only patch that can be cut without destroying the patch 's ability to deliver nicotine through the skin to the bloodstream reliably.. It is not unsafe to cut the other patches as far as I know . However cutting the other patches impairs the transdermal drug delivery system , and may not provide reliable blood levels of nicotine . the key word here is reliable . The total dose of nicotine in the patch does not correlate at a milligram to milligram equivalency to the dose delivered to the bloodstream . The drug delivery system of the patch ensures that nicotine is transported thru the skin at a constant rate , and e ach manufacturer uses a different patented technology to do this . Only a portion of the total nicotine contained in the patch is transported thru the skin . Individual differences in skin thickness , location of the applied patch , and other related factors play a role in the total dose delivered . 3 Step Tapering Method of using the patch o The 21 mg patch is worn daily for 6-8 weeks for quitters who smoked an average of 1 ppd ( 2 ppd quitters may require 2 patches to alleviate cravings and withdrawal symptoms ) o The 14 mg patch is then worn daily for the next 2 to 4 weeks if the ex smoker remains confident in his or her ability to not smoke and if urges or cravings to smoke are controlled . o The 7 mg patch is then worn for 2-4 weeks if the same criteria as above are met . o In the absence of cravings and urge to smoke the patch is then stopped entirely . It is important to individualize the tapering method . . . Some people require longer periods of use , others shorter . If cravings intensify , return to the next higher dose of the patch . Types of nicotine patches Nicotrol 15,10,5 mg 16 hour patches",0

"What is the right age to get married ? Age is n't as important as maturity and so many other factors , like life goals , and personality compatibility . We all are at some stage in life .

Yet { some early vertebrates ] had 7 toes ... .8 toes ... .6 toes . ... My tentative guess is thatin those early times the different species really did benefit from their respective numbers of toes ... Later the tetrapod limb design hardened at 5 digits because some internal embryonic process came to rely upon that number .

That said , it IS entirely possible that it may happen again - I just would n't count on it . Too much has to happen in just the right way for a team to win 19 games in a row !",0

"Is it common for the surgical pen ( attatched to a broken leg ) to poke thru the skin ? My cat recently broke her back right femur in 5 seperate splinters and had to have a surgical pen adhered to the bone with wires . How common is it for it to shift up and actually pierce thru the skin ? Does this happen often in the mediacl industry , in humans or animals ? What could have caused it ? It can . Some procedures ( with humans ) require either external braces that are acually attatched to the bone via pins and screws . Some are temporary screws that are left sticking out of the bone that eventually may protrude through the skin . The doctors do n't make them flush with the surface of the bone because that makes it easier to remove them . However , the inside of bones is sterile . If bacteria is introduced , there could be a severe , life-threatening infection brewing . I would call your cat 's vet .",0

We get on very well except one thing , he has a female friend that I do n't care for . She is always all over his myspace and on his birthday she threw him a birthday party and the next day posts pictures of herself kissing his face ( which he insists is innocent and `` friendly '' . ) I was upset because I felt that had I been there ( it was on a weeknight and I work fulltime ) she would n't have dared . He claims that 's `` just her personality '' and that she did n't mean anything by it . I am also concered that she dated her best friend 's boyfriend for months behind her back . I am now not even allow to say anything about her . He gets upset and tells me I have to `` get over it '' . But I feel like I have a right to feel uncomfortble . He has already told me he will not stop seeing her . It drives me crazy to see the party pictures the next day.I know he would never cheat on me so I am not worried about that . Help me ! Well ... yes , it would bug me , but I 'd keep it to myself ...

"How do you cure bumps on the back of the scalp ( male ) that never go away ? I know other black males that suffer from the same problem . The bumps never go away , only subside after antifungal treatment , nearly disappearing , but still visible under the skin . They possibly get inflamed under stressful conditions . I 've had this problem for nearly 6 years now . I have short hair and wash it twice daily . Heeeeeeeeeeeelp . It could be cysts that are from much earlier pimples that are sealed off and have no pore opening . A Dermatologist ( skin doctor ) can inject them if they are large and they will go away . Could also be ingrown hairs or hairs that have migrated into the skin after a hair cut . If you have health insurance call your regular doctor and they will refer you to a dermatologist sometimes over the phone and it will be covered . Even if no health insurance it is less expensive that most health care . Good luck !",0

That will make it too easy to at least have an `` emotional '' affair , if not slip into a physical one .

"Why do people not help others as a matter of course ? If I meet someone , and they need help of some kind , I do everything in my power to help them . Others will say 'I 'm too busy , ' or 'That 's their problem ' . What has happened to the world ? It has sadly become far too focused on itself . If you need more proof , just take a look around at the number of people engaged in a cell phone conversation in public.It seems to me our entire culture has turned in on itself , making it ever more convenient to separate ourselves from the world . Technology has become a double-edged sword , providing us with amazing new ways to be more productive and organized , but often at the expense of human interaction . Communicaton and entertainment devices provide us with amazing mobility , but our Blackberrys and iPods only further cut us off from one another.Of course , technology is n't the whole problem . Our culture has also become incredibly jaded and disenfranchised , always expecting the worst from others and usually getting it . We use childish , egotistical athletes as role models , making life all about `` getting paid '' . Our fascination with celebrity has become an obsession -- just check out the ratings for `` reality '' shows . And our domestic and international political views are too often shaped by sound bites and media talking heads . Apparently it 's just easier to agree with someone than figure it out yourself.I do n't believe it has to be like this . Our technological advancements do n't have to come with a price that devalues our very existence . And we do not just have to accept that the world with all its troubles is simply beyond redemption . We simply have to want to be involved in the lives of others . How do we do that ? Parents have to care more about their kids ' relationships with others ( not to mention their own ) than they do about making sure they 're doing the right things . We have to educate on how to use technology to collaborate , instead of to isolate . We have to look harder for our heroes . Let 's face it -- the one thing 9/11 taught Americans was who they really were . In short , we all have to love ourselves and life and be obsessed about them less .",0

"why is the Pacific Ocean so cold all the time ? the atlantic ocean is so warm , and the other ocean , the PACIFIC , is so cold . why ? In the southern half of the ocean the Humboldt Current flows north along the coast of South America . The cold mineral rich waters support many millions of small fish , which are eaten by larger fish and seabirds.At regular intervals a huge area of the Pacific becomes warmer . Because warm water rises above cold , the sea-level increases . This change in temperature and level causes an alteration in the pattern of the winds . The warm water travels across the Pacific at 100 kms a day . This phenomenon , known as El Nino , deflects the Humboldt Current . 1997 saw the highest temperature recorded of this warm water during the last 150 years .",0

"Why is `` importantly '' being used so much these days ? This is a perfectly good word when used in the proper way . It is an adverb ... as in `` He dressed importantly for the meeting '' .

'' It reminds me of the time when everyone was using the non-word , irregardless . They finally wised up on that one though . im·portant·ly adv . Usage Note : Some critics have objected to the use of the phrase more importantly in place of more important when one introduces an assertion , as in More importantly , no one is ready to step into the vacuum left by the retiring senator . But both forms are widely used by reputable writers , and there is no obvious reason for preferring one or the other. -- -- -- -- -- -ir·re·gard·less ( P ) Pronunciation Key ( r-gärdls ) adv . Nonstandard Regardless . [ Probably blend of irrespective , and regardless . ] Usage Note : Irregardless is a word that many mistakenly believe to be correct usage in formal style , when in fact it is used chiefly in nonstandard speech or casual writing . Coined in the United States in the early 20th century , it has met with a blizzard of condemnation for being an improper yoking of irrespective and regardless and for the logical absurdity of combining the negative ir- prefix and -less suffix in a single term . Although one might reasonably argue that it is no different from words with redundant affixes like debone and unravel , it has been considered a blunder for decades and will probably continue to be so .",0

"The Atomists were determinists. ? true or false There have been very many different atomists , and some were determinists , others not . Democritus , the first real atomist we can verify , was a determinist , so to speak , but really believed that the world was an illusion , which essentially precludes the question of determinism . Epicurus , one of the other first atomists was strongly anti-determinist , and introduced a random element , called the swerve , to attempt to solve the problem of determinism . Most people today who have a basic knowledge of the nature of the atom are obviously atomists , and I believe most people are not determinists .",0

"George Reeves ( Superman ) Murder or Suicide ? George Reeves - Actor 1914-1959 George Keefer Brewer was born in Woolstock , Iowa on January 5 , 1914 . Probably best known for his acting career in the hit Superman TV series during the 1950 's George was a well accomplished film and play actor as well . He starred in numerous leading and supporting roles in a variety of famous films dating back to 1939 including the blockbuster `` Gone with the Wind '' where he portrayed one of Scarlet 's suitors.George Reeves was 45 years old in 1959 when he was found dead in his home from a single gun shot . Many people speculate that he was murdered but his death was ruled a suicide predicated on the fact that he was in a deep depression state due to his inability to find acting work because he was typecast as superman . I personally do not believe that he took his own life , this man was strong willed , full of life and had everything to live for.The circumstances of his mysterious death and the investigation that followed left many unanswered questions and speculation . On the evening of his death , George was entertaining his girlfriend and a few friends in his lavish Hollywood home when he reportedly went upstairs by himself to his bedroom . After about a half hour the guests heard a single gun shot and found George lying dead on his back across the side of the bed with his feet still on the floor . George was killed instantly my a German Luger pistol bullet that went through his skull and lodged in the wall above his bed near the ceiling . The shell casing from the bullet was found after the police picked him up , he had been laying on it . It is still unknown as to how the casing got there and how George could of been lying on the shell casing if he would have taken his own life . No suicide note was found , and there was never the slightest indication from George that he might be in a depressed state . This is one of those mysteries that we may never find out the real truth .",0

"How to fight graft and corruption ? If it is in a corporation , there are special laws to grant you whistleblower status , and you can move into this role under a degree of legal protection from retribution.If it is in a government , then it can be very difficult depending on the nature of the government . Dictatorships are notorious for systemic corruption , and there is little that can be done without coup or significant intervention ( or perhaps populist uprising , although you 'd be risking your life ) . In a democracy , the corruption is of a softer sort , and you may be able to counter-act it via a public interest campaign , or story presented to the news media.Now if the graft and corruption is within your own heart ... that 's a real toughie . It requires a degree of personal strength and conviction to ideals which extend beyond your person . I think all human beings have the capacity for such strength and compassion , but it requires a willingness to make the hard choices both for yourself and your community .",0

"how do i score a 750+ + score for the GMAT ? Which courses , books etc should I use ? The GMAT is essentially a glorified SAT - all the stuff in there you definitely learned pre-college . I 've never been a big proponent of the GMAT classes because I feel you can get everything out of the book . The class is n't going to teach you some random formula you do n't already know . Both the books and classes essentially spell out what format of questions will be asked in each section . Then they drill you on that format repeatedly until solving for that type of equation or that grammatical structure is second nature no matter what weird way they ask it on the test . I would recommend getting one of the books , Kaplan is pretty much the industry standard . Read it all the way through . Then take every practice test in the book , then save a few bucks and go hang out in the bookstore and take a half a dozen practice tests in other GMAT prep books . Review every question on your test you got wrong and go back into the book to see what “ format ” of question it is and review that again . Then use the free CDROM that should come with your prep book to focus in on any sections you are bombing on the practice tests . This worked for me and one of my buddies . We studied for about two weeks for an average of 3 hours a day and topped out over 750 . The MCAT would be another story…thank god I don ’ t want to be a doctor…",0

"why is the child support system not more fair to the fathers who are in their child ` s life ? What cheermom stated demonstrates that there are similarities between California and Iowa . The point to keep in mind is that the Child Support Systems are usually divided into multiple sections . For those who work with individuals involved in the various cases , those who look out for the interests of the children , those are involved in the getting payments form the State to the primary care giver of the child , and those who collect money owed by a parent of record who is mandated by the court to make payments . These departments must follow the orders of the court . That is , a parent who is working to be involved in the life of the child is a great thing , but if they are not paying their court ordered child support payments , these departments have no choice but to act for the court and collect the funds from the delinquent parent . If a parent disagrees with the amount owed ( for whatever reason ) , their argument is not with the State departments but with the court and they must go back to the court to have a new order issued.Here in Iowa they will go after the delinquent parent irregardless of their job position and this includes working with other States . Only the court can change this reality.I realize that it can be frustrating , but the parents are best served if they do not try to mix things such as visitations and child support payments , the courts view them as two different actions .",0

What is Programming from scratch ? without any software ? yes I know u can program from Visual Studio or Eclipse or any other softwarebut what 's the origin ? somebody programmed that program..so what did he use ? and more originally somebody made the operating system ... with what ? Most Processor Chips have been shipped with some type of C compiler already programmed for them . Most of those compilers were built from machine level code ( very low level code that only the processor understands . Called Machine Language or Assembly Language . ) Microsoft 's Visual Studio has gone above the normal C compiler for processors and included Windows specific code instructions too . C is considered a High Level language . When a compiler compiles code in C is usually ends up into very complex string of smaller instructions .,0

"Why does society treat us as a unisex ? According to biological studies men and women are different in physical makeup , hormones , and even brain activity . According to psychological studies men and women have different wants , needs , and desires . Where some are the same they often have different priority levels.So , why does western culture treat us as a unisex ? That we are all supposed to be the same and teats down people who accept those distinct difference ? Western culture treats us as equal because of the ERA , womens rights movements , and feminist groups that demand equality . Unfortunately , there seems to be an either/or side-effect . We are either unisex beings with no differences , or we become stereotypes of man/woman . There is no middle ground yet because the politically correct crowd is afraid of stepping on toes .",0

"does anyone think that literature effects everyone 's everyday life ? I 'm sure many including myself will agree on the fact that literature affects one 's life immensely .

A person who is a fanatic of Sherlock Holmes will learn to analyse things deeply and will develop skills of perception and systematic thinking.Many people also picture themselves as one of the characters .

"Does Koran recognize Jews ’ ‘ Deed of Ownership ’ regarding Palestine as the Promised Land ? `` That land , the Promised Land , was given by God to the Jews in the Bible , which is our Deed of Ownership , an ownership recognized in the Kuran itself ! `` I asked a question 2 hours ago .

For details , please see that answer . http : //answers.yahoo.com/question/ ; _ylt=Am9iPSwhQW.CBlEttT2gKzwjzKIX ? qid=1006021203731 Koran recognizes Jews and their prophet , Mosa as well as Christians and their prophet Jesus . Koran also recognizes that Jerusalem is the Holy Land of Jews . But this ca n't interpreted as a deed of ownership . Jews always try to distort it by purpose in order to make Moslims to serve them for the establishment of Big Israel State between two rivers , exactly like how they convince Christians that it is a Christian duty to support Jews cause they are chosen , etc.Moslims are not taught to be hate Jews . Moslims respect them and the fact that Jerusalem is their Holy Land . Their greedy unrealistic Big Israel Utopia which is covering whole Middle East and their violance in Palestine make Moslims hate them . See , we respect them , their Holy Land , but as usual , it is not enough , they ask for the deed of ownership . [ 62-6,7,8 ] : Say ( O Muhammad ) : O ye who are Jews , if ye claim that ye are the favoured of Allah apart from ( all ) mankind , then long for death if you are truthful . But they will never long for it because of all that their own hands have sent before , and Allah is Aware of evil-doers .

"What are the problems the No Child Left Behind Act has presented ? The biggest problem is that it makes teachers focus on teaching to a test rather than just teaching . Knowing how to take the test is more important , under this system , than knowing what is on it . Further , the act has been severely underfunded . The act requires more qualified teachers ( aka ones with more education ) , but more education means higher pay , which is something many school districts ca n't do.I think more importantly than any of those problems , there 's the issue of how to measure improvement . Under the act each class is compared to the previous class , meaning this year 's 2nd grade is compared to last year 's 2nd grade . Now , obviously comparing different groups of kids is fundamentally unfair . People do n't like to admit it , but some people have different base levels of intelligence . Certainly everyone who is not developmentally challenged should be able to pass high school reasonably , but to fault a school and its teachers simply because one class is , on average , not quite as smart is the most asinine thing I can think of . Thankfully the DOE is starting a pilot program of comparing student scores across their school careers ( comparing last year 's 2nd grade scores to this year 's 3rd grade scores ) . That is obviously the better way to do it , but making the switch is going to cost money , something the act has failed to provide .",0

"Pope Benedict 's stance on the Charasmatic Renewal ? What is Pope Benedicts stance on the Charasmatic Renewal of the Catholic Church . I recieved the Holy Ghost , with tongues , in Catholicism.I was under the impression then that Pope John Paul II had a favorable attitude towards it , but what about the current Pope Benedics ? I think that Pope Benedict is in support of this movement in general , though he , like others in the Catholic hierarchy , has some concerns about it . He seems to support the movement , but reminds members to stay connected to the whole Church . The quotation below is from before he was elected Pope . For his part , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , has added his voice to the Pope 's in acknowledging the good occurring in the Charismatic Renewal and providing some cautions . In a forward to a book by Cardinal Suenens , at that time the Pope 's delegate to the Charismatic Renewal , the Prefect comments on the Post-Conciliar period stating , '' At the heart of a world imbued with a rationalistic skepticism , a new experience of the Holy Spirit suddenly burst forth . And , since then , that experience has assumed a breadth of a worldwide Renewal movement . What the New Testament tells us about the charisms - which were seen as visible signs of the coming of the Spirit - is not just ancient history , over and done with , for it is once again becoming extremely topical . `` Speaking of the book 's subject , renewal and the powers of darkness , he says , '' What is the relation between personal experience and the common faith of the Church ? Both factors are important : a dogmatic faith unsupported by personal experience remains empty ; mere personal experience unrelated to the faith of the Church remains blind . `` Finally , he urges those who read the book to pay special attention to the author 's double plea , '' ... to those responsible for the ecclesiastical ministry - from parish priests to bishops - not to let the Renewal pass them by but to welcome it fully ; and on the other ( hand ) ... to the members of the Renewal to cherish and maintain their link with the whole Church and with the charisms of their pastors . `` [ Renewal and the Powers of Darkness , Leo Cardinal Suenens ( Ann Arbor : Servant Books , 1983 ) ]",0

"what do you do yourself to cut down your appetite ? The basics of most nutrition booksDon ’ t starve yourself . That ’ s the worst thing you can do in a diet because it slows down your metabolism and your body starts getting more fat from your food intake since , fat is the bodies fastest and easiest type of nutrition [ not the healthiest though ] . The reason this happen is because this helped us when we were no doing so good as hunters and gathers to keep us alive a bit longer . Before I continue let me explain protein , carbohydrates , and fats.Protein is easiest described as anything that comes from or was an animal such chicken , fish , sirloin , and milk . Carbohydrates [ carbs ] can be found almost in anything else even apples.Good carbs : Apples , wheat bread , sourdough bread , grains , and wheat Bad carbs : White bread , hamburger buns , hotdog buns , Doritos , and sodas ! Good fats : Avocados , pecans , almonds , and peanut butter The ratio in your diet varies but I think a good starting point is something like [ 50 % Protien:40 % Carbs:10 % fat ] This can sound meaningless . So in plain terms consume only good fats [ portioned ] and you should be okay . Something like a handful of almonds , or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [ separately . not consecutively ] . The reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because you are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [ Proteins are 4 calories , Carbs are 4 calories , Fats are 9 calories ] so theoretically if you eat less fats and more proteins you will have a less appetite because you will eat more . Another nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself . That ’ s how the Adkins basically works . If you consume more proteins and less carbs you will lose weight . I leave to you to decide if this is good you.I would also advice you to split up your day into 5 meals . [ warning : it will feel weird because you are not used to eating this decreased amount . Just keep in mind that you will eat in 3 hour and you will quickly noticed that you will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry ] if you do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla.You are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [ if you have been starving yourself or if you don ’ t exercise ] .",0
"Would you change the way you constructed these two pages if you were going to do them now ? The exciting thing I find with CSS is that , as with many aspects of 'semantic/structural markup ' , there is often no 'One True Way ' of doing something . Just look at the growing number of image replacement techniques which have surfaced over the years . I still find that I 'm learning something new with CSS every day , with every project I tackle . Sometimes , it takes a lucky accident , or a fresh way of looking at a problem , to discover a better , more robust or more elegant way to solve a specific problem . So , certainly , if I had to do these designs again today , I would probably do many things differently . I just hope that , almost three years down the line , people wo n't start dissecting my submitted CSS and start laughing at some of the naïve blunders that are hidden in there .",0

"Did the Broncos lose or did the Steelers just win ? That 's always a tough question . Did the Broncos just not show up or was it the Steeler 's amazing play that shut 'em down ? My take : while the Steelers did play extremely well , the Broncos failed in every aspect of the game . Aside from Bailey and occasional glimpses of Lynch , I did n't see a single Broncos player play well . Here are my top reasons why the Broncos lost on Sunday : # 1 reason : Jake Plummer . with two fumbles and two interceptions , he totally folded . Tough to overome that many turnovers . # 2 - defense . the Broncos could n't stop the Steelers ' running OR passing game # 3 - special teams . terrible by the Broncos . Seemed like the Steelers always had excellent position and the Broncos never did .",0

"why are you a Christian ? honestly I was introduced to Christianity growing up , but that is n't why I 'm Christian . It is very obvious to me that someone had to create the world and universe . So many wonderful miraculous things happen to people that can not be explained by logic , or natural order . Even the complexity of natural order is too vast to be by impossible chance . This led me to know that there is a Supreme Being.As for why Christianity , there are a couple of reasons . The Bible has never been proven inacurate , which supports the fact that it is divinely inspired . Some good/interesting books about this topic are written by Lee Strobel `` The Case for Christ '' `` The Case for a Creator '' and a couple more . Even when the Bible has n't been believed , someone has come across ruins that disproves man 's theory , and inforces that the Bible is right . Creation interpretation of data makes sense to me , and having the world be ~6000 years old gets rid of lots of problems ( like there should be billions more people on the earth if it has been around for millions of years , the fact that trees that are buried in layers supposedly thousands of years apart should have rotted , not nearly enough fossils- let alone NONE that are inbetweens , etc ) . These are physical external reasons to me.There is also a much more important internal aspect to why I allow Christ to rule my life . Reading His Word , applying His principles ( which never contradict each other ) , and knowing that someone always loves me no matter how much I screw up has made a difference in my life . This change is so real that I can be certain of God , His Son , and the Holy Spirit . I now never have that 'does anybody care ? ' empty feeling , or the 'why am I even here/what is the point of existance ? ' attitude . This does not mean that I have the perfect life , and all is sunshine . I sometimes have down days , I still get frusterated at times and ask why , but there is always an instruction manual to go to , and He is always with me . That is a very comforting thought , that the God of the entire universe specifically loves me , cares about me , listens to me whenever I take the time to talk with Him , and can change my attitudes and bless me . How wonderful !",0

Mail ? `` I figured that with Walt Mossberg saying : I 've been comparing the new version of Yahoo Mail , which claims to be the leader in Web mail , with Gmail , the challenger Yahoo most fears . My verdict : The new Yahoo Mail is far superior to Gmail . Yahoo more closely matches the desktop experience most serious email users have come to expect ... .and PC Magazine saying : ... there 's no question that Yahoo ! is set to make a big leap forward with its new Web-based mail product . We 'll hold off on a rating until the official release or at least the full public beta , but from what we 've seen and tested so far , Yahoo ! 's competition may soon have some serious catching up to do ... .and the AP saying : Overall , I find Yahoo easier to use , and it 's quite impressive for a product that 's only weeks old . I expect even more features by the time a final version is released.Well , I figured that the cat was pretty well out of the bag : the new Yahoo ! Mail kicks a lot of ass . For lots of people out there , it 's going to be the first web-based replacement for Outlook or Outlook express they 've ever seen.And it 's got some serious `` WOW '' factor going for it . I still remember when Ethan turned on my access a few months ago . I was at home packing for my trip to Parowan when he gave me the URL . The interface loaded up and I just thought ... wow ! It was slower back then and has some bugs but it was already clear that it was going to move expectations up a level or two.Oh , and if you look at that screenshot , you 'll see that there are over 42,000 messages in my inbox . The product still works well with a big volume of mail.Now stop asking when I 'm gon na write about it ! : - ) BTW , It is a closed beta right now but that should change soon . In the meantime I 've asked the Yahoo ! Mail team if I could give out a few `` invites '' so faithful readers could try it out . No response yet , so no promises .

"Why is the ocean blue ? It might sound like i 'm joking.. But i really need to know . Is it because it 's reflecting off the sky ? Water is faint blue . Although water appears clear in small quanities ( like a glass of water ) , the blue color becomes visible the more water we look through . Thus , deep lakes and seas are bluer than a shallow river.Other factors can affect the color we see : 1 . Particles and solutes can absorb light , as in tea or coffee . Green algae in rivers and streams often lend a blue-green color . The red sea has occasional blooms of red Trichodesmium erythraeum algae . 2 . Particles in water can scatter light . The Colorado river is often muddy red because of suspended reddish silt in the water . Some mountain lakes and streams with finely gound rock , such as glacial flour , are tourquise . Light scattering by suspended matter is required in order that the blue light produced by water 's absorption can return to the surface and be observed . Such scattering can also shift the spectrum of the emerging photons toward the green , a color often seen when water laden with suspended particles is observed . 3 . The surface of seas and lakes often reflect blue skylight , making them appear bluer . [ [ [ Montana reflection . ] ] ] The relative contribution of reflected skylight and the light scattered back from the depths is strongly dependent on observation angle .",0

"how to seek a ideal job ? I would say the first thing to do is identify what you consider ideal and perhaps write it down . With those qualities in mind you can begin to think seriously about who you would want to work for , where you would want to work and what kind of work you would want to do . As you are thinking about that , take a look at your resume / cv . Does your knowledge , skills , experiences and education align you with your perfect job or do you need additional skills and training to help make you more marketable . If there are gaps , now is the time to address them.With that accomplished , you can set out with your list of qualities and your resume to find your perfect job . I suggest the best approach to this facet of your job search is to use a mixed approach . You can put your resume on the boards , but my experience has proven that it is n't the most effecient or effective way to find a job . Additionally , scour the job boards ( Monster.com , Hotjobs . com , Careerbuilder.com and any niche sites that you may know of or be a member of ) and identify jobs that you would want to apply for . Make sure that you are not kidding yourself or overestimating your abilities.While all of this is going on get the word out , talk to everyone you know and let them know that you are on the market and what kind of work you are looking for . Networking is one of the most effective ways to find a job.This is n't an exhaustive step-by-step guide , but it should help you get started . All of this advice comes from a number of years of experience as a recruiter for large corporations .",0

"how to treat hiv naturally ? This is an interesting question . You can not `` treat '' HIV with natural products but you can use alternative medicine to complement traditional treatment . I 've done a lot of work with HIV patients and this approach seemed to provide the best outcome . In my practice , we use a lot of accupuncture , nutritional intervention , bio-feedback and counseling in addition to modern medicine . Our patients do very well . As for when to start the drugs , that 's still a debate . You need to sit down with your health care provider to discuss this ( prefably with an HIV specialist ) . Let me know if you have any more questions ... Priscilla",0

"What are the odds of a man catching HIV while having unprotected sex ( oral and vaginally ) ? What are the odds of a man catching HIV while having unprotected sex ( oral and vaginally ) with a woman who is HIV positive or AIDS . How do those odds change over time ? In other words , one sexual encounter versus multiple ? The following numbers are old , and they 're all pretty much guesswork anyway , so take them with a grain of salt . But I venture to say most people in the field would agree with my conclusions.According to a report by researchers Norman Hearst and Stephen Hulley in the Journal of the American Medical Association , the odds of a heterosexual becoming infected with AIDS after one episode of penile-vaginal intercourse with someone in a non-high-risk group without a condom are one in 5 million . With a condom it 's even safer -- one in 50 million . Just to put this in perspective , the chances of someone in your family getting injured next year in a bubble bath are 1 in 1.3 million ( source : The Odds on Virtually Everything , Heron House , 1980 ) . You 're in much greater danger of being struck by lightning ( 1 in 600,000 ) , having your house bombed ( 1 in 290,000 ) , or being murdered ( 1 in 11,000 ) .The numbers get a lot worse if you engage in `` high-risk behavior '' -- having sexual intercourse or sharing needles with a member of a high-risk group , e.g. , a gay or bisexual male or IV drug user from a major metro area , or a hemophiliac . The chances of getting AIDS from one such encounter range as high as 1 in 10,000 using a condom to 1 in 1,000 unprotected . Even if your partner tests negative for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , the chances of infection from a high-risk person are still relatively high -- 1 in 50,000 without a condom . That 's because there 's a 45 to 90 day window during which a newly infected person can infect others but test negative . ( A few people go as long as 180 days . ) From there on out , statistically speaking , things deteriorate pretty fast . If your partner is HIV-positive , your chances of getting AIDS after one night are 1 in 5,000 with a condom , 1 in 500 without . Have sex with an HIV-positive partner 500 times using condoms and your chances escalate to 1 in 11 . Skip the gift wrap and they 're 2 in 3.A couple points : These odds apply equally to men and women . Although there 's reason to believe male-to-female AIDS transmission happens more often than female-to-male , the amount of difference is unknown . Also , I have to emphasize again , the numbers involve a lot of guesswork . The authors admit they could be off by a factor of ten in either direction . Still , one message comes through loud and clear : by far the best thing you can do to avoid AIDS is to be picky about your partners . Use of condoms reduces your risk by a factor of 10 , sleeping only with people who test negative reduces it by a factor of 5 to 50 , but avoiding high-risk partners reduces it by a factor of 5,000 . ( You 'd also be well advised to avoid high-risk behavior , such as unprotected receptive anal sex . ) Asking for a resume may not be romantic , but it beats Kaposi 's sarcoma .",0
"Why Muslims do n't condemn the threats of Islamists to kill the danish cartoonists ? Iread today and i was upset that a Pakistani cleric promised bounty on the head of the cartoonist . like living in middle-ages or stone-ages where ppl got bounties on their head because of their opinion . of course there are more than one , but the cleric , as usual as many clerics , is ignorant probably took his information from somewhere : '' He said the mosque and his religious school would give $ 25,000 and a car , while a local jewelers ' association would give another $ 1 million . No representative of the association was available to confirm it had made the offer . `` This is a unanimous decision of by all imams ( prayer leaders ) of Islam that whoever insults the prophet deserves to be killed and whoever will take this insulting man to his end , will get this prize , '' Qureshi said . `` http : //news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060217/ap_on_re_mi_ea/prophet_drawingsWhy do n't you if you muslims do n't condemn such act openly ? if you are non-Muslim , how can we protect those innocent cartoonists ? To answer your original question , it is because Islam will NOT hold their fellow Muslims accountable for their actions.When asked of a Muslim , why doesn ’ t the Islamic majority in the United Nation condemn the thousands of terrorist acts perpetrated by those of your faith ? The answer comes back , “ We can not judge our Muslim brothers . Only Allah can judge them. ” Yet when it comes to judging the infidel , there are no holds barred . Now , let us contrast this attitude with what the Bible teaches.1 Corinthians 5:11-13For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside ? Do you not judge those who are inside ? But those who are outside God judges.This is the polar opposite to Islam . The Bible teaches that the Christian is to judge the actions of other Christians and call them on the carpet if they are doing ANYTHING unbiblical . However , those who are NOT believers , the Christian is to leave alone , that only GOD will judge them.So there is the contrast . If Islam was really concerned about peace , and was a peaceful religion , they would do something to stop these violent people . But do n't hold your breath .",0

Can someone tell me when Google Earth update the Images ? Images on of my City Chandigarh are Six months old . Google gets its imagery from several different sources . It is my understanding that they buy the imagery from private companies such as DigitalGlobe and EarthSat/MDA . It is my understanding that they are able to get this imagery at a greater bargain since they do n't necessarily request high resolution of specific areas . Rather they just take the imagery that these company 's other clients have already requested and had tasked . As such Google rolls new imagery as it becomes more easily available from the companies . That is why areas outside of the US have less high resolution imagery -- because there are not other client requesting and paying for that information to be collected .,0

"Does the government have the right to order private internet companies to provide user 's search records ? Lately both Yahoo and Google where served a court ordered to hand over to the government some search records regarding porn Some good answers here . I 'll take a stab at it myself , though I do n't know anything about the incidents other than what the original poster included in his question.First , we 're talking about illegal pornography . `` Regular '' porn , the kind that is n't illegal depending on whoever 's standards we 're using , is n't going to be subject to a search warrant because it is n't a crime ... and search warrants can only be issued when they seek to provide evidence of a public offense ( a crime ) . So whatever porn we 're talking about , it 's evidently illegal according to whatever legal standard is being used ( and this varies , but things like kiddy porn are illegal everywhere in the US ) . Once the illegality has been established , then I do n't think there 's much left to talk about ... you can not hide behind a right to privacy if you are engaging in criminal behavior . That 's not to say you give up your right to privacy , it 's to say that if you 're engaging in criminal acts , the government has the right to ask a judge for a search warrant to gather evidence of those acts , and I would argue that you can not complain about your privacy being `` invaded '' when they do.And a word about search warrants ; they are not rubber-stamped documents that sail through the justice system to your front door . Law enforcement agents must prepare an application for them , outlining reasons to believe a particular place holds evidence of a particular crime . They must swear the things they 've said in that document are true , and then they must present the document to a neutral party - a magistrate ( or a judge ) . That magistrate ( or judge ) then reviews the information provided by the agent , and decides on his/her own if there is a more than likely chance ( i.e. , `` probable cause '' ) that the things the agents are looking for are in the places the agents say they are . Despite the rare news to the contrary , magistrates and law enforcement alike take this process seriously.About the `` third party '' argument made by the original poster : again - if you 're engaging in criminal behavior , you can not expect to hide behind the right to privacy just because you 've given the evidence of your guilt to a third party . The government has the right under our system of law to gather evidence of your criminal behavior , no matter where you have left it.If you want to deliver evidence of your involvement in criminal acts to a third party , press on ... and you do so at your own risk , obviously . The original poster 's comment is well taken ; if your third party is going to comply with an order of a court to disclose certain information relative to criminal acts , then perhaps you need to find another third party - one who will become a criminal themselves if they fail to comply with a lawful court order.Yahoo and Google have not betrayed anyone 's trust ... although it 's been a while since I 've seen them , I 'm fairly certain both corporations have privacy policies , and I 'm equally certain both of them talk about safeguarding your information except when ordered to release it pursuant to a court order . If the third party thing bothers you , do n't use a third party ... there 's a saying : `` three can keep a secret , if two are dead . '' Do n't want anybody to know what you 're doing ? Do n't tell anybody .",0

"My friend is a marathon runner and he is getting cramps at mile 18 . What can he do ? He has run 4 marathons. ? Cramps are usually the result of mineral depletion . Others have advised about replenishing water and sodium , but overlook the importance of potassium , and , to a lesser extent , magnesium . While in training , he should have his potassium level checked to see if it is well within normal range ( 4.0 to 5.0 ) If not , he should ask his doctor about possible daily supplements . If it is normal , he should consider potassium loading before the race ( good foods include bananas , sweet potatoes , oranges ) and then supplementing during the race , either with pills ( preferably with a doctor 's OK ) , or , if his gastro system can handle it , orange juice or other high potassium fluids ; most sports drinks have only trace amounts of potassium . I 've run a few marathons and run at a relaxed pace , and thus it does n't bother my stomach to drink a quart of OJ an hour before the race and a pint at mile 14 ( supplied by a waiting family member ) , and this has helped reduce cramping a lot - I used to get severe charley horses at mile 19 . Tell your friend to search potassium loading on the web , there are a few references to it in marathon forums . The caveat is that a high potassium level is dangerous ; in people with normal kidney function , the kidney sloughs off any excess harmlessly ; but if renal function is impaired , high doses of potassium are contraindicated .",0

"Opinion of Marijuana v/s Alcoholic Beverages ? Should both be illegal or legal ? What are the differences to you ? Have you used both in your lifetime ? I find that alcohol seems to take whatever mood a person is in and magnify it ; so a person who is drinking in celebration becomes more exhuberant , the person who is drinking out of anger becomes more beligerant , and the person who is drinking out of depression sinks even lower . On the other hand , Marijuana typically mellows a person regardless of their mood going into it . It is common for people to become paranoid when using pot , especially with ongoing use . Both are used most often to relax and unwind ; but can become misused as a means to avoid problems . With both , the user builds a tolerance to the substance , so more and more is needed to have the desired effect with continued use . Both will alter the user 's perception and judgement.My opinion is that as long as cigarettes and alcohol are legal , there is no reason why marijuana should n't be -- it is no worse than either of those drugs . I do n't know from a medical/research standpoint , but it seems to me that alcohol is actually more harmful to the body than pot , and I believe that it is socially more harmful , because of the effects I 've observed that I noted above . If marjuana were legal , I would use it on a weekend night before watching a movie or something . In the past , I went through phases when I would smoke daily -- and it really saps motivation from a person . I used to drink , probably the most before I was of legal age . I got sick plenty of times . Now I do n't like the taste , and many alcoholic beverages actually give me a sinus/allergy attack . So it is rare for me to use either of these things now .",0

As the gay-hating ( for lack of a better word ) in Christianity and most modern organized religion stemmed from base hatred of gay supporting cultures ( as in Rome , where homosexuality in men was considered more 'manly ' ) , such things were probably used to discourage people in an ancestor-based society .

"When will I do not want any cigarette , if I can quit ? You will probably want a cigarette for a long time . I have been off cigarettes now for two years and I STILL want one . It is funny though . Your brain makes you think it is better than it really is . If you think you NEED one - then do have one , you more than likely will be disapointed as it was not as good as you expected . It is hard no doubt , but it gets easier the longer you are off them . I know many people that , like myself quit smoking by using the nicotine gum . I started on the Nicorette , and now I am perfectly happy on the Kroger brand @ $ 29 for 110 pieces .

"MUMTAZ . the beatiful Indian actress . Any information about her ? Biography for Mumtaz ( I ) Nickname Mumu -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Height 5 ' 7 '' ( 1.70 m ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Mini biography Mumtaz entered the film scene as a cherubic young girl of 14-15 years of age in 60s . Too young to be cast as leading lady , she started with bit roles only , but was not missed , and quickly graduated to lead roles in low budget movies . She was extremely versatile , beautiful , charming , and stole everybody 's heart by her captivating looks and inspired performances in each of her film . She quickly out-shadowed and dethroned the established queens in a very short time because of her histrionics . Mumtaz was sensitive , quick to understand and translate every nuance hinted at , onto the screen . Even in her brief roles against established actresses , she was the one who got noticed more and lingered in viewers memories for longer periods . She acted in more than 100 films during a short career span of 14 years , and there is not even a single film in which her performance could not be termed as excellent . In her very first film with significant banner and role , Khilona ( 1970 ) , she won the most coveted Filmfare award in 1970 . She has also been awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by Filmfare in 1997 . She was in the Marilyn Monroe mould ; every man 's fantasy woman . She outshone everybody because of the simple reason that she was so versatile that every role appeared as if it was written with just Mumtaz in mind . Whether the role was negative or positive , serious or light , she proved her worth . Whether the role was for an urbanite or rustic , majestic or pauper , innocent or vile , gentle or venomous , coy or flaunting , Mumtaz just fitted them like a glove . The public adulation for her is still strong . The response to the continuous spate of screening of her movies on various television channels , even after more than two decades of her self-retirement , proves her tremendous unending popularity due to her incomparable charisma .",0

"what do these college sports phrases mean ? 1 ) true freshman 2 ) fifth year senior 3 ) walk on 4 ) red shirt . Thanks The NCAA rules allow a player 5 years to complete his/her 4 years of eligibility.A true freshman is someone playing during the first year of eligibility.A fifth year senior is someone who sat out a year ( see red shirt ) and is completing the 4th year of eligibility during his/her 5th year in school.A walkon is someone who was not recruted and given a scholarship . The athlete just showed up , tried out , and was good enough to stay on the team.A red shirt is an athlete who is passing up a year of play to extend eligibility . Red shirted players are allowed to practice with the team but not take part in competition.Originally , red shirting was allowed if an athlete was injured severly enough to end his season . The team could petition the NCAA for an extra year of eligibilty , and the player was red shirted for the remainder of the year.The name comes from the practice of having injured football players wear a red practice jersey to protect him during practice . Today redshirting may be done to allow a player to gain an extra year of experience before playing in `` The Big Time '' . It also may be done as a personel management tool . If a coach has two equally good players competing for one position as quarterback , one may be redshirted . That way his eligability is n't used up sitting on the bench .",0

"How do you help a people who lost 6 million souls ? My great grandfather was captured brought to Auswitz Natzi death camp and tortured for a long time untill one day he escaped succesfull but while losing his friends who were shot and killed by the Nazis in an attempt to escape . Out of 26 only 4 lived . 6 Million of my anscestors perrsihed in what is called the Holocost . Oh ! `` Tears '' This is so hard to write ! Can you imagine being 10 years old in one of those cattle cars not knowing where these nazis were taking you and then seeing the smoke from the creamatroiums . You ask , where is my father or mother and someone points to the smoke and sais , there , they are going to heaven . `` Weeps ! `` .We must never forget the holocost folks ! But I wonder if any of you have an idea of how this Jew from a surviving family of the holocost could honar and help other such families ? I just do n't know how to express my heart and its breaking when i considder 6 million of my own people dead at the hand of Hitler . Paperclips is a very powerful documentary and I agree , EVERYONE should watch it . It should be a requirement in school . As should be Schindlers List . All through my childhood I heard my fraternal grandparents talk about Hitler and the Nazis . They came to the state not long after he came into power and started persecuting the jews . While not jewish themselves they had many close friends that were and could n't stand to watch them suffer . Knowing this was only the beginning they left Germany and came to the US . If Hitlers name was mentioned around my Grandma tears welled up in her eyes and she called hi the worst evil that had ever happened to mankind . But by far the most powerful and moving thing I have ever felt was when I was 16 . I was visiting relatives in Europe with my Aunt . Knowing what I was studying in school that semester we took a side trip and she took me to Auschwitz so that i could truely understand what I was being taught , though we were n't Jewish she wanted me to understand . As long as I live i will remember that , seeing the ovens and hearing what happened there . It was almost as if that place screamed in pain still for the evil that was committed there . No member of our tour group was left dry eyed by the time it was over . The most vivid memory of it was seeing the ovens then hearing the older lady next to us break down in tears . Turns out she was dying of cancer and before she departed this earth she had to see where he parents and brothers had perished.To so many of us evil of this enormity is hard to grasp and fathom but every day of our lives we see or hear a small part of it . Every time you utter a racial slur , make a biggoted remark , show intolerance to anothers religion or belief system you are perpetuating Hitlers legacy . Because that is what it was , hatered and biggotry and intolerance . It took 6 million people dying for the rest of the world to understand that lesson , of what that mindframe and and those views can bring about . And the worst thing we can do is forget it or glorify the kinds of acts or thinking that brought on all of those deaths . Because it was n't hitler alone that killed them all , it was people who felt the way he did and thought nothing of it . Look around you and i bet you have met people like that . Or maybe you are yourself , so none of this has gone away and all the lessons have not sunk in . Six million people , our minds truely ca n't wrap around that number . All because of intolerance and biggotry . As you read through the answers to some of the questions on these pages you can see it here as well . Intolerance to other peoples view or religions , a supreme and superior attitude because 'I am right my religion is right the rest of you are wrong ' . That attitude is what helped take 6 million people from this earth . That is what ALLOWED the nazis to do what they did . They saw those in those camps as wrong and not as good as themselves , that they were superior . Those camps still exhist today as a reminder of that evil . And believe me if you walk through the gates you can feel it , you can feel the pain and anguish that went on there . It screams at you from every inch of it . 6 MILLION people killed because someone else was sure they were right and they were superior . Those shows on the History Channel SHOULD upset you ! They should upset you every time you see them and never should you become callous to them or what they show . That is about the only reminder this world has left of what can come from biggotry and hatered.Next time , before you write out from your superior point of view and point out how everyone else is wrong , or laugh at an ethnic joke or make fun of someone because they are different think about Hitler and what that kind of mindset can cause ... SIX MILLION SOULS TAKEN FROM THIS EARTH BECAUSE THE NAZIS THOUGHT THEY WERE BETTER AND KNEW THEY WERE RIGHT !",0

"Is it really worth buying and trying Crest White Strips for whitening teeth ? Yes , and , actually , the Crest White Strips Premium are worth the extra money . For some reason , they do n't make your teeth as sensitive during the whitening process.One thing that you have to keep in mind is that you have to find the time to use the product . You have to keep the strips on for 30 minutes at a time , twice a day . I usually did this before I went to work in the morning , and after I got home , before I went out again . But it 's kindof hard to commit to if you have a really busy schedule.My uncle is an orthodontist and told me that if you have really sensitive teeth , Crest White Strips are still safe to use . Just because they cause pain does n't mean they 're harming you , they 're just making your teeth sensitive during the whitening process.Happy smiles !",0

Remember , The 9-11 terrorists only had boxcutters , and I 'll bet they did n't bother to read any laws . The Patriot Act makes suspects out of honest people , and violates the rights of innocent people , the people that laws are supposed to protect . The Patriot Act is a perversion of the law . The President and all the rest of these public servants who act more like they are our rulers took an oath to uphold the Constitution , not disregard it , and not pass whatever laws they want as if the Constitution did not exist . What they do sounds more like treason to me -- or at least a great reason to kick them out of their offices onto their smug asses . Remember : the purpose of the Constitution is to protect you from your government . It probably works to some degree . We 've managed to prevent some terrorist actions as a result of it ... although at the expense of diminishing the authority of the U.S. Constitution.I 'm a believer in slippery slopes so I imagine the logical end to all of this is to preempt every potentially illegal action by putting the entire population of the country into prison ... just to be on the safe side .",0
"Is WAR a new kind of spectator sport , or do n't we as people GET IT ? ? ? War has always been a spectator sport . During the Civil War , crowds of people would ride out on a Sunday to watch the battle from a ridge in the distance . War correspondents have always reported on the progress of wars , with the news eagerly followed by proponents and opponenets of the war alike . The word `` marathon '' remembers a man who ran 26 miles back to Athens to report news of the Greek victory at Marathon , and then died.In most ways it is a good thing . War the the most serious government act , and as much should be known about the conduct of a war by the poeple as possible . Democracy is meaningless otherwise .",0

"Do you think children have a preference for one parent over another ? I was observing kids and their parents in a public location . I noticed the little girls were walking hand in hand with their father and the little boys were walking with their mother . I was wondering if boys tend to gravitate to their moms , while girls gravitate to their dads . I think parents tend to have a natural protection type sheild over the opposite sex offspring . Like a daddy and his little girl , there is nobody who can come in between them until sweet sixteen when daddy 's cleaning the shotgun , while mothers want their sons to turn out to be men of honor that women will want while he still has respect . I feel children will gravitate towards the nicer parents because their minds are so simple they respond to the parent who is nicer . If you left a jar full of sugar in front of a 4 year old it would be gone in a matter of minutes because they do n't know any reason why they should n't eat it all . When a parent scolds a child the child is instantaneously resentful because they have no idea of the long term effects , does that make sence ? ?",0

I was divorced 4 years ago after a 25 year marraige , i am a okay looking guy , i guess , so i have been told Always by the younger ladies . I am 52 and i have been around everyone in thier twenties and thirties for the past 3 years . Everybody my age are - well lets just say they are old , i 'm not . I do n't act or look my age . I am open to almost anything and i am myself , not someone else . I do n't pretend to be something i 'm not . Hope there is someone who wants an honest and good guy .

I 'm not trying to be hurtful in any way ; I 'm trying to honestly explain to you how your above approach might look to women . Me ?

"Why is alcohol legal ? In the UK the number of alcohol related deaths soars past 20 , 000 per year , and in the USA , the figure is more than double that . It was once illegal in the US , during a period known as prohibition . However , while alcohol use dipped initially , prohibition 's negative effects outweighed the positive ones . One problem is that despite the fact that alcohol was illegal , it was easy to make and import alcohol from outside the US . As well , prohibition did a great deal to contribute to organized crime , which profited of sales of alcohol . Since alcohol consumption was and is still well established in American and British culture , the demand is such that underground organizations would thrive . As such , we would see an increase in crime and probably not a tremendous fall in alcohol-related crime.To add to that , the alcohol-making industry has much more resources than the prohibitionist movement and thus prohibition is also less politically viable for financial reasons.For more info on prohibition , check out the Wikipedia article below .",0

"will the usa ever win the soccer world cup ? I believe the USA can win the World Cup this year . Noone is writing us off this time around . We are ranked in the top 10 by FIFA . To go along with our ranking , we have some of the best goalkeeping in the world ( Keller , Howard , and a number of MLS keepers like Reis and Hartman ) . We have a solid defense with Bocanegra , Onyewu , Hejduk , and Pope ( and maybe even Pablo Mastroeni ) . World-class midfielders in Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley will be stepping onto the pitch ( not to mention the solid job players like Kerry Zavagnin put forth each and every time they take the field ) . Up top , we have the emergence of Taylor Twellman in the international game and the return of Eddie Johnson to the fold . We have a coach in Bruce Arena who , I believe , if he leaves after the tournament , should get a top-flight European league job next fall ( Malcolm Glazer hiring Bruce Arena at ManU if Sir Alex Ferguson were to leave ? A long shot maybe , but intriguing. ) . Add to that , one of Italy 's best players , Francesco Totti , recently went down with a serious injury and will be out until at least May . Even if he does come back for the tournament , will he be at full strength ? Ghana 's midfielder Laryea Kingston will also miss the tournament through suspension . While we have a tough road to travel both in our group and with the possibility of Brazil lurking in the round of 16 , I believe the USA has the ability to take on the world 's best and win it all .",0

"A child is suffereing from cardiac myopathy and she is given 24 hours medicne injected ( connected to machine ) D Doctors suggest she can live only with support of medicines . Is that true . Is there any other solution . she is only 1 year old . So surgery is not possible.Is there any cure for such patients how long they can survive , can they live without medicine . plesase advice Cardiomyopathy is a chronic and sometimes progressive disease in which the heart muscle ( myocardium ) , is abnormally enlarged , thickened and/or stiffened . The condition typically begins in the walls of the heart 's lower chambers ( ventricles ) , and in more severe cases also affects the walls of the upper chambers ( atria ) . The actual muscle cells as well as the surrounding tissues of the heart become damaged . Eventually , the weakened heart loses the ability to pump blood effectively and heart failure or irregular heartbeats ( arrhythmias or dysrhythmia ) may occur . The medication that she is being given is probably being used to help the heart contract or function better . The medication being given by machine is just to make sure it is n't given too quickly because of how small your child is.It is likely she will need some sort of medication the rest of her life . If she is a candidate for a heart transplant , she will still need to be on some sort of medication the rest of her life.You need to speak to your daughters Pediatrian or Cardiac Doctor if you have questions .

"What does a scaled score of 363 mean on the MAT ? The MAT scaled scores currently range from 200 to 600 with a mean ( average ) of 400 . So a score of 363 is somewhat below the average score . In order to know just how much below average this score represents you need to know the standard deviation of the test to see if it 363 is greater than one standard deviation below the norm . Otherwise it would fall within the normal range.Your personal score report should also have given you a percentile rank , which tells you how you did in comparison with others who took the test . This is sometimes easier to understand than standard scores . For example , a percentile rank of 45 means that you scored as high or higher than 45 out of 100 people who took the test .",0

"Recommend a good cheap webcam for WinXP ? By cheap I mean under $ 30 or £20 . Besides chatting ( Skype 2.0 ) , it should also be helpful working with distant colleagues on design projects . ( E.g . pointing the camera at a scribble . ) I 'd prefer something that does n't come with buggy or otherwise irritating software .

"i dunno how to have sex & i'l b gettin maried soon.being a muslim i cant evr do it b4 my weding.i need help ? actually being a muslim and then eastern culture we girls dont know much about sex.my fiance like girls who are active sexually.i dunno how to do it.im scared i wont b able to satisfy him.i tried searching online but didnt get get any proper information.its not possible for me to buy those kinda books or watch movies that would help me.coz first of all they arent that easily available and my family wont ever let me watch it.but my fiance really wants me to know more about it.what can i do about it ? where can i get the info from ? i know the obvious answer that many are probably thinking , if he loves you then you will be fine . in fact the is not at true as most people would like to think . Your not just talking about sex you 're talking about intamcy as well . WHen you do have sex for the first time i wo n't lie it hurts . The reason it will hurt for the most part is because oyu will be so nervous about be nakeed and having sex that all of your muscles will be conctracting . Which will then in turn make it that more difficult for your finance to enter . just remeber that when you have sex with him that he loves oyu he wo n't be juding you in anyway he will be overwhelmed with the fact that he is with you for the rest of his life that he will just be in awe . also keep in mind that the first time is going to be a little bumpy because you two do n't know each others movements yets . so yees it will be awkward . having sex for the first time is different for eeveryone . but it may be easier , since it seems to me that he has had sex before , if he were to get on top . so that way you wo n't feeel that yopu have to do everything . Something that might make it easier is buy some kind of lubercation it makes it easier to get sttarted . with the lubercation you put it on him to make it more arousing for him and this will give you and oppurtunity to see , and feel what your husband feels like . make it fun for yourself . while you are doing that for him he could be doing something for you . either kissing your neck messaging your inner thighs . if you have a little for play it might take away some of the tension . It is most definetly going to be hard for you to be doing all of this . but just remeber that it will get easier . do n't forget that he 's not the only one that is there for fun . soemthing that might also arouse him and you as well is take is hands and put them on various parts of you and then you return the favor while he carressing you you do the same . moving on to the sex part of it . pull him towaards you so that he knows to get on top . then opoen your legs so that it is comfortable to you and he can get his whole body in . if you do n't feel comfortable adjust and then proceed . when he starts to insert in to you MAKE SURE HE GOES SLOWLY . if anything starts to hurt tell him adn he should either stop or pull out . the key is to communicate . IT will be uncomfortable the first couple of times that you do it . but the lubercation should help out to some degree . After he has entered all the way , now is the time when you should be more relaxed . Now the hardest paart is over . While haveing sex make suree at all times that you are comfortable if your not then sex just wo n't be the same later . if your lower back hurts put a pillow under neith your back and continue . if you do n't know how to move your body then have him move your body so that you both will enjoy it . and if you feel comfortable enough you amy want to get on top . If you do get on to , then just bend your knees so that they are by his hips , and sit directly over top of his penis . oncew he is back inside then move back towards is knees slightly and begin to move . if you do n't know how take is haveds and put them on your hips and let him know that he needs to help . once he gets you going you can do it on your own . Of course this is all just a suggestion and you should do what feels right to you , i hope that i could help you CONGRADULATIONS and good luck . just remember RELAX .",0

"If the Google people are supposed to be so smart , how come so many of their recent UIs are lame ? Google reader is pretty bad . Google desktop is clunky ( although a good idea in theory ) . Google groups is lame . Heck even their Google Answers sucks in comparison to this Yahoo Answers site.In addition , it seems to me that yahoo , ask.com and some others are innovating more on search results . For example , enter in a name of a sports team ( in season ) on different search engines and you 'll see a good example of what I mean.Do they have too many programmers/engineers and not enough true , touchy/feely UI designers ? Does Google plan to just live off their brand now ? Concerned Google stockholder . In my opinion , Google was never something more than a great search engine . In an early era where dial-up was more common than broadband , Google built a top-notch engine with a very light UI which made it an immediate favorite amongst a lot of users . What was nice about Google was that it never aspired to be something someone else was , it created its own identity as a very comprehensive search engine . However , offlate , I have started losing faith in Google , especially because their objectives and goals as a company seem very unclear . A chunk of their revenue still comes through ads , and their search engine is really the only intellectual property they have developed from the ground-up , otherwise everything else is either just an acquisition or a bad idea . Google earth was previously keynote , Google Talk has been built upon Jabber which is an open source technology for messaging and these were the `` other '' great ideas besides the search engine , but things like web accelerators and secure connection through VPN are just lame excuses to drive internet traffic through their servers.Another great idea from Google was desktop search , but somehow they never capitalized on the idea , and today MSN has come out tops in this department.At the end of the day , Google isnt running out of ideas , I think they are running out of focus , something that companies like Yahoo have and very well defined ones at that .",0

"does lifting weights during basketball season affect your shot at all ? my shot has been off recently and one of my friends thought it might be form lifting weights so i thought id check it out . Unfortunately , the buffing up does affect your shot . This is because the added muscle mass if you try to go up in amount of weight will cause the power you put behind your shot to increase . You should always lift in the off-season , and keep a consistent lower amount to lift to maintain tone during the season . Say go up 5 lbs . a week before season and stay 15 lbs under your max through the season to stay tone . Also , do n't lift everyday , let muscles relax so they can stay healthy , they are anerobic .",0

"If God is no respector of persons , why do some christians practise open racism and segregation even inthe churc bolter_70002 you should be ashamed of your self using Hilter as a comparision to Christians is just plain ignorant .

As far as the question goes , people are flawed , some people like to pretend to be christians so that can have a reason to be hatefull , that is not christian though . I will make the statement maybe others do n't want to if you are racist or belive yourself to be above other human beings than you are no christian just a wolve in sheeps clothing , being a follower of Christ is about being humble , and leaving a life of servitude , Christ said what you do for the least of those you do unto ME .

"What is Trans Fat ? How to reduce that ? I heard that tras fat is bad for the body . Why is that ? Where can we find it in our daily food ? Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation , when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil . The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat , which raises `` bad '' LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease . Until very recently , food labels were not required to list trans fats , and this health risk remained hidden to consumers . In early July , FDA regulations changed , and food labels will soon begin identifying trans fat content in processed foods .",0

"War ? Why ? The real reason please . To force a way of life on the conqured ? Or for power and economic gain ? From the earliest history of humanity , war has always been about only two things - for power , and for resources , and many times it is for both - and many other times it is a war for power cloaked under a war for religion or resources . Hitler claimed he attacked poland for resources - he claimed he needed land for the German people , but that was really for his own power . Religious wars have been fought and are fought for power . For the power that those at the top of religion have over thier people . The best way to consolodate your power over your own people is to unify them against an enemy . That goes for political power as well as religious . The religious leaders of Europe fought the holy wars for thier own gains , claiming it was religious duty , however those at the top weilded the power over thier people by sending them to war . The warriors fought for god and religion , but those in power facilitated this . War will never go away because there will never be equity - someone will always have what someone else has . If by some miracle of technology , anyone can have anything , there will still be wars for power - power is the one thing that ca n't be fabricated . If you look at the current muslim extremists , they are not fighting for thier gods , they are fighting for power , and indirectly for resources . They want to create a muslim world , where they will have the power , and by having the power , they will get the resources . If you look at the heart of any conflict , you 'll see it - resources and power . Those are the core reasons for ANY war . However , since it takes two to make war . The Allies could n't stand aside while Hitler took over Europe and killed millions - wars are started by those who want resources and power , but are ended by people who fight for the defense of themselves and others . Wars are rarely started for honorable reasons , but they are often ended by honorable people , who sacrifice themselves to stop the greedy , the evil , and the powerhungry . However , sometimes , those who fight the evil and powerhungry have dishonorable motives of thier own , but they can claim the moral highground because they did n't start the war , and they will benefit from defeating the ones who started it , and maybe because they destroyed a greater evil , it is accepted . Sometimes you have to trade a great evil for a lesser evil.This also goes for society on the small scale as well - Christians claim homosexuals are evil sinners in order to strengthen thier own group - any group gets stronger with a common enemy . There is no better way to facilitate group cohesion , and this group cohesion in this case leads to even more power for those at the top . Life is a power struggle .",0

"16 year difference in age - college teacher/ former student . How long before it ends ? I am curious as to other 's ideas . My ex-husband , a professional ethics prof , left me for one of his former students . She was then 20 , he 36 . We 's been married 13 years , together 15+ and it was very sudden . She knew he was married , and she was in lesbian relationship living with lover ; never been with man . Huge power differential , and she is still a student so he pays for all her living expenses in the apartment they share . She went from her female lovers place , where she dropped the bomb , to my ex 's new apartment in one day.Part of me feels that it was a mid-life crisis , but he invested so much he ca n't ever tell me so or apologize to me.Thoughts ? Know of similar prof/student relationships that worked long haul ? ? ? She could have been just struggling financially and looking for a sugar daddy . Or she might be serious about him , who knows . But even then they will be together for a while , but let 's say in ten years she will still be young and he ... not so much . She 'll end up leaving him for a younger guy too , which will serve him right . Ethics professor my a** !

At the time of the games , wars stopped , and athletes came from Asia Minor , Syria , Egypt , and Sicily to celebrate the Olympics and to worship their king of Gods : Zeus . * The Colossus of Rhodes The island of Rhodes was an important economic centre in the ancient world . It is located off the southwestern tip of Asia Minor where the Aegean Sea meets the Mediterranean . The capitol city , also named Rhodes , was built in 408 B.C * The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus Eight hundred years after its destruction , the magnificent Temple of Artemis at Ephesus , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , had been completely forgotten by the people of the town that had once held it in such pride… * The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is the burial place of an ancient king . Yet the Mausoleum is different - so different from the Pyramid that it earned its reputation - and a spot within the list - for other reasons . Geographically , it is closer to the Temple of Artemis ... And it was the beauty of the tomb rather than its size that fascinated its visitors for years . * The Pharos of Alexandria ( The Lighthouse of Alexandria ) Of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , only one had a practical use in addition to its architectural elegance : The Lighthouse of Alexandria . For sailors , it ensured a safe return to the Great Harbor . For architects , it meant even more : it was the tallest building on Earth . And for scientists , it was the mysterious mirror that fascinated them most ... The mirror which reflection could be seen more than 50 km ( 35 miles ) off-shore.Of those , opnly the Pyramids remain today.There are more modern wonders : * Great Pyramid of Giza* Great Wall of China* Taj Mahal* Serengeti Migration* Galapagos Islands* Grand Canyon* Machu PicchuModern world : * Channel Tunnel* CN Tower* Empire State Building* Golden Gate Bridge* Itaipu Dam* Netherlands ' Tidal Defences* Panama CanalNatural wonders : * Grand Canyon* Great Barrier Reef* Harbor of Rio de Janeiro* Mount Everest* Northern Lights* Paricutín volcano* Victoria FallsUnderwater wonders : PalauBelize Barrier ReefGreat Barrier ReefDeep-Sea VentsGalapagos IslandsLake BaikalNorthern Red Sea",0

It 's been reliable and fast . My wife has owned a Toshiba for over three years.I surf the internet , play music on it , write technical papers , send e-mails , write programs , and run numerical analyses on it.Battery life could be better . I can only go for about an hour and a half before the battery depletes.If you are going to be taking notes in classes , you may want to get two batteries for it so you can get several hours of uptime without connecting to a power supply.The rest of it ... Gigahertz , Pentium , Celeron , AMD really does n't matter these days . Almost any laptop will play DVDs ( with a DVD player ) , CDs , etc plenty fast.In fact , the lower the Gigahertz ( the clock rate which at which the processor ( AMD or Intel ) ticks along ) , the longer your batter life may be . Slowest Gigahertz you should go with is about 1.5GHz.I would make sure that the notebook has at least 512MB of memory , preferably 1GB . This is important if you run several programs at once ( e-mail , internet , music player , and word processor ) . If you do n't , things can slow down and wear down battery life faster as data is moved on and off disk.I would go with a 15 '' LCD . 17 '' is better if you are at your desk all the time , but if you are carrying the thing around a lot , the smaller display makes for a more compact laptop . To each his own.Any brand-name laptop ( HP , Dell , IBM , Toshiba ) should do well to meet your requirements .",0

"define ergonomics elobrately ? Ergonomics ( or human factors ) is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system , and the profession that applies theory , principles , data and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance ( definition adopted by the International Ergonomics Association in 2000 ) .Ergonomists contribute to the design and evaluation of tasks , jobs , products , environments and systems in order to make them compatible with the needs , abilities and limitations of people ( IEA , 2000 ) .DomainsThe IEA divides ergonomics broadly into three domains : Physical ergonomics deals with the human body 's responses to physical and physiological loads . Relevant topics include manual materials handling , workstation layout , job demands , and risk factors such as repetition , vibration , force and awkward/static posture as they relate to musculoskeletal disorders ( see repetitive strain injury ) .Cognitive ergonomics , also known as engineering psychology , concerns mental processes such as perception , attention , cognition , motor control , and memory storage and retrieval as they affect interactions among humans and other elements of a system . Relevant topics include mental workload , vigilance , decision-making , skilled performance , human error , human-computer interaction , and training.Organizational ergonomics , or macroergonomics , is concerned with the optimization of sociotechnical systems , including their organizational structures , policies , and processes . Relevant topics include shift work , scheduling , job satisfaction , motivational theory , supervision , teamwork , telework and ethics.HistoryItalian Bernardino Ramazinni ( 1633-1714 ) became the first physician to write about work-related injuries and illnesses in his 1700 publication , `` De Morbis Artificum ( Diseases of Workers ) '' . Ramazinni was ostracized by his fellow doctors for visiting the workplaces of his patients in order to identify the causes of their disorders . The term ergonomics ( from the Greek words ergon [ work ] and nomoi [ natural laws ] ) first entered the modern lexicon when Wojciech Jastrzębowski used the word in his 1857 article Rys ergonomji czyli nauki o pracy , opartej na prawdach poczerpniętych z Nauki Przyrody ( adapted from a previous version of this page ) .Later in the 19th century , Frederick Taylor pioneered the `` Scientific Management '' method , an approach that sought the single best method to perform a job and its tasks . By incrementally reducing the size and weight of coal shovels until the optimum shoveling rate was reached , Taylor tripled the amount of coal that workers could shovel in a day . Frank and Lilian Gilbreth , in the early 1900s , expanded Taylor 's methods to develop `` Time and Motion Studies '' that aimed to improve efficiency by eliminating unnecessary steps and actions . By applying this approach , the Gilbreths reduced the number of motions in bricklaying from 18 to 4.5 , allowing bricklayers to increase their pace of laying bricks from 120 to 350 bricks per hour.World War II marked the advent of highly sophisticated machines and weaponry , creating previously unseen cognitive demands on operators in terms of decision-making , attention , situational awareness and hand-eye coordination . It was observed that perfectly working aircraft , flown by the best-trained pilots , still crashed . In 1943 , Alphonse Chapanis , a lieutenant in the U.S. Army , showed that `` pilot error '' could be greatly reduced when more logical and differentiable controls replaced confusing designs in airplane cockpits.In the decades following the war and leading to today , ergonomics has continued to flourish and diversify . The Space Age created new human factors issues such as weightlessness and extreme G-forces . To what extent could these environments be tolerated and what effects would they have on the mind and body ? The Information",0
"what is pollination ? pollination , transfer of pollen from the male reproductive organ ( stamen or staminate cone ) to the female reproductive organ ( pistil or pistillate cone ) of the same or of another flower or cone . Pollination is not to be confused with fertilization , which it may precede by some time—a full season in many conifers . The most common agents of pollination are flying insects ( as in most flowering plants ) and the wind ( as in many trees and all grasses and conifers ) , but crawling and hopping insects , snails , bats , primates , rodents , and hummingbirds may also serve . The devices that operate to ensure cross-pollination and prevent self-pollination ( see sex ) are varied and sometimes extremely intricate . Among them are different maturation times for the pollen and eggs of the same flower or plant , separate staminate and pistillate flowers on the same or on different plants , chemical properties that make the pollen and eggs of the same plant sterile to each other , and specialized mechanisms or structural arrangements that prevent the pollinating agent from transferring the pollen of a flower to its own stigma . In the lady's-slipper the bee enters the nectar-filled pouch by one opening and must leave by another ; in so doing it brushes first past the stigma , which scrapes pollen off its back , and then past the stamens , which deposit another load of pollen . The stamens of the mountain laurel are bent back and held like springs by notches in the petals ; when the bee alights it contacts the tall pistil and then , in probing deeper for nectar , triggers the stamens . Pollen is catapulted onto the insect 's underside , ready for contact with the next pistil . Other examples of floral adaptations to their pollinating agents are the fig and its wasp and the yucca and its moth . Wind pollination , depending as it does on statistical chance for successful pollination , requires vast quantities of pollen , which may be forcefully ejected by the anther sac ( as in grasses and ragweed ) or may be exposed ( as in cones and catkins ) to the slightest breeze .

"Should there be a law concerning credit related lawsuits ? Now that congress has passed the new bankruptcy laws that do not allow credit obligations to be totally wiped clean , this has given creditors free reign to file lawsuits for bad credit . The amount of lawsuits are jumping high as it is forcing people to file bankruptcy which under the new rules forces them to pay regardless . This use to be bad policy for creditors as it created bad business for consumers . Do creditors have right to sue consumers with money they have made off of consumers ? Should credit be regarded as an investment made by a creditor to a consumer and if that investment goes bad to not cry about it ? Are in likewise manner people allowed to sue companies and stock brokers if our investments are lost for one reason or another ? So if that can not be allowed should corporations be allowed to sue consumers for their own bad investments ? Should this be allowed or should congress amend the law to disallow lawsuits for credit obligations ?

"Does anyone know who William Tyndale was ? Info from Wikipedia : William Tyndale ( sometimes spelled Tindale ) ( ca.1484 - October 6 , 1536 ) was a 16th century priest and scholar who translated the Bible into the Early Modern English of his day . Although numerous partial and complete English translations had been made from the 7th century onward , Tyndale 's was the first to take advantage of the new medium of print , which allowed for its wide distribution . Later , in October 1536 , he was killed by strangulation and then burned at the stake.Much of Tyndale 's works eventually found its way to the King James Version , which , though the work of 54 independent scholars , is based primarily on Tyndale 's translations.For more information follow this link : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tyndale",0
"why are people so ignorant about the Pagan based religions or witchcraft ? Well , you are certain to get a bunch of Christians jumping on this one , which may be an answer in itself . Much ignorance is due to having a different point of view ( usually christian , but perhaps other `` standard '' religions as well ) that prevents you from seeking real facts.Secondly , the pagan mysteries have long protected themselves , hiding behind symbols , misdirection and so on , because of persecution . Remember the burning times ! ( i.e. , the inquisition . ) Also , I think many modern pagans , witches , wicca , ( use what term you will ) , believe that only a small percentage of people are capable of being a part of the pagan world : one might almost call it snobbery . Think of Malfoy and his contempt for anyone who is not born a `` pureblood '' witch or wizard . You think Rawlings pulled that out of pure imagination ?

"Could a sudden onset of depression be caused by a lingering side effect of anesthesia a month or so later ? My son had a sudden onset of depression and anxiety yesterday and is still going through it . I spoke with him and was very unsure what to say and how to handle the situation . He said he just did n't know what was wrong and he could n't seem to shake it . This was all coming from a 25 year old who has always been very confident and never been this way ever a day in his life . He has been very successful in his job , which he does have a fairly new position in a new town , which he does n't like , but has done great at anyway . Someone mentioned to him that they heard before sometimes anesthesia can leave side effects afterwards like depression and I just wondered if there was a possibility it could have effected him in this way . He has actually had a couple of minor procedures with anesthesia in the past few months . no",0

"Do non-smokers have rights too ? Yes , you non-smokers have rights too , but you give them away by allowing : 1 ) Smoking to be LEGAL , & 2 ) By allowing extra taxation on cigarettes to benefit all Americans . When will American ’ s stop being hypocrites to smokers by rapping smokers of their money and health and then yelling at smokers for providing tax money to all of America ? If we truly cared about America we would find ways to make tobacco illegal and give up the revenue from tobacco.PS : I have not had a cigarette for 12 Days . . . No I ’ m not moody from withdrawals , I just think American ’ s are hypocrites when it comes to smokers . Sin/Use taxes are somewhat better than illegalizing sin/use completely . At least then the ills caused by the sin or damage by the use are paid for by those doing the sin/use . Example : Road use..polution.. gas tax , is both a use and sin tax . Still Illegalizing sin is somewhat ( arguably ) better than flaunting immoral activities to our children . Sins will never be black or white issues they will allways be subjective . This is usually where society gets all messed up . We get on one or the other side and assume there is only one right answer in the Drugs , Right to live or die debates .

"What really distinguishes AJAX programming from traditional web programming ( html/javascript ) ? AJAX uses a bit of javascript that uses the XmlHTTP object . This object , opens up a connection to a Web server , transmits and receives data , then calls back the javascript on the page which was used to invoke it.What this means is that changes on the client side can communicate with the server , then dynamically update the client user interface without having to request a new Web page from the server.While this slightly complicates developing Web applications that use AJAX technologies ( which , by the way , is just a name given to the various technologies employed to use this methodology ) , it makes for a very smooth user experience since they are not constantly refreshing Web pages.AJAX applications give an appearance of a 'thick client ' application while still being a 'thin client ' ( i.e . application that runs in a Web browser . ) However , it is important to note that network communication is still going on in the background while the application is being used .",0

"what is cancer ? Simple answer : A cell in the body that has gone out of control causing a disease.Cancer is a class of diseases characterized by uncontrolled division of cells and the ability of these cells to invade other tissues , either by direct growth into adjacent tissue ( invasion ) or by implantation into distant sites ( metastasis ) . This unregulated growth is caused by damage to DNA , resulting in mutations to genes that control cell division . Several mutations may be required to transform a normal cell into a malignant cell . These mutations are often caused by chemicals or physical agents called carcinogens . Some mutations occur spontaneously , or they can be inherited ( germ line mutations . ) Cancer can cause many different symptoms , depending on the site and character of the malignancy and whether there is metastasis . Cancer may be painless . A definitive diagnosis usually requires the histologic examination of tissue by a pathologist . This tissue is obtained by biopsy or surgery . Once diagnosed , cancer is usually treated with surgery , chemotherapy , or radiation.If untreated , cancers may eventually cause death . Cancer is mainly a disease of later years , and is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries . Most cancers can be treated and many cured , especially if treatment begins early . Many forms of cancer are associated with exposure to environmental factors , such as tobacco smoking , alcohol , and certain viruses . Some of these can be avoidable , and public health and vaccination programmes are important on a global scale.Another viewpoint : A general term for about 100 diseases characterized by uncontrolled , abnormal growth of cells . The resulting mass , or tumor , can invade and destroy surrounding normal tissues . Cancer cells from the tumor can spread through the blood or lymph ( the clear fluid that bathes body cells ) to start new cancers in other parts of the body ( metastases ) .",0

"little white lies and white magic ... why is white perceived as 'good ' ? black magic relates to destruction and sacrifice , but 'white ' magic is the work of growth and creation . a little 'white ' lie is usually regarded as okay , but lying in general is looked down upon . in both cases , why is 'white ' perceived as good ? where did this way of categorizing things come from ? is there a religious reason for this ? First of all little “ white ” lies are only acceptable to some in the general population . Many still believe that all lies are contrary to best behavior . But as an example , I get your point.The association of white with good and black with bad predates recorded history . This generalization is almost universally true in all cultures.The best possible answer goes back to the time before artificial nocturnal lighting . Humans are visual creatures . We tend to rely upon and believe what our visual system records . The eye itself has two kinds of receptors . These are called Rods and Cones . The Rods are more sensitive and give us the shades of gray in “ night vision. ” The Cones respond to colors and are more active during the day . Humans see more clearly and with better spatial acuity during daylight hours.White is a mixture of colors and is only perceived during the day . Daylight = Better vision = Good . At night , when the rods take over : Night = Poor vision = Bad.For a very detail report on vision , try the site below :",0

"Confusing riddle.. who 's who ? At a local bar , three friends , Mr. Green , Mr. Red and Mr. Blue , were having a drink . One man was wearing a red suit ; one a green suit ; and the other a blue suit . `` Have you noticed , '' said the man the blue suit , `` that although our suits have colors corresponding to our names , not one of us is wearing a suit that matches our own names ? '' Mr. Red looked at the other two and said , `` You 're absolutely correct . `` What color suit is each man wearing ? If we apply logic to this , we can assume that since Mr. Red LOOKED at the man with the blue suit , so hence , Mr. Red is n't wearing blue , and since he ca n't wear his own color , then he must be wearing green . Following this , then , the man in the blue suit has to be either Mr. Green , or Mr. Blue . And since no one is wearing their own color , then Mr. Blue can not be the man in the blue suit , so that leaves Mr. Green to be wearing the blue suit . With only the red suit left to figure out , we then assume that Mr. Blue is the one wearing it !",0

"whats the best small business to open ? In my opinion , and experience , the best small business to launch is an online business .

You will be paid for each click , when visitors come to the site , see ads of interest to them , and click the ads . The best things about this business is the initial investment is very low . You have no inventory to stock , no orders to fill , no customers to contend with , no shoplifting , no breakage , no back breaking boxes to lift , no employees to hire , no rush hour traffic , and no credit card fraud . You are looking at monthly hosting fees of $ 20 or less , you design in , so there is no design fee .

We work from home , set our own hours , and just wait each month for the check from Adsense or YPN to arrive . It does n't get any easier , or any more flexible .",0

They are predominantly kept because of familiarity and historical convention . That said , in China it is easier for the nation to function administratively with only one time-zone , so they have chosen that . In the United States , the government chose to have time-zones for the people over administrative reasons ... although some regions of the country ( such as parts of Indiana and Arizona ) have selected rules that do not follow the national norm ( i.e . they do n't use Daylight Savings Time ) .",0
"How do they arrive at the number that represents the DJIA ? What is meant by it is up points ? How is the dow jones industrials avg . calculated and when they say it is up so many points what does that mean ? Nice description on ameritrade.com ... ..One of the best-known market indicators , the Dow Jones Industrial Average , is comprised of 30 leading companies . Calculated by adding the prices of these 30 stocks , the Dow is now considered a figure that indicates the general state of the market . Originally , the Dow divided the sum of the prices of the 30 stocks by 30 , giving a true average . However , to be consistent every time a stock split or paid a dividend , the number 30 had to be adjusted . Now , over 100 years later , the sum of the prices of the 30 stocks is divided by a number less than one ! Since a $ 1 movement in the price of a $ 100 stock counts equally with a $ 1 movement in the price of a $ 20 stock , the Dow Jones is considered a price weighted index.Charles Dow designed the average to represent the current business market , which in 1896 included industries such as sugar , leather , tobacco , gas , rubber and coal . Today the DJIA is led by retailers , oil , technology , pharmaceutical and entertainment companies . The only company on the original list that is still included today is General Electric .",0

"How do you change direction when swimming freestyle in a pool ? You know what I mean : good swimmers just kind of do a 180 and then kick off in the opposite direction . It 's clear that you have to flip over and turn over , but I find it tricky . I 'm generally very coordinated , so I think I just need some tips . A flip turn is done by basically gliding into the wall and flipping into a back-stroke glid and eventually turning back onto your front . With your momentum carrying you into the wall , tuck your head under so your upper torso will be on its back . Your legs will follow over and the momentum will carry your legs into the wall . In the glide position on your back slowly turn back onto your front . As you improve and get your orientation you will be able to flip while on your side , and will be able to more efficiently do your turn . Things to watch when turning , work on your timing coming into the wall . You will need to be able to judge when you should start your flip turns , that 's what the T on the lane lines are for . Keep from going to deep when doing your turns . Keep your body stream lined into the wall and coming off the wall . Think of your body as hinged at your hips and keep both halves extended when flipping - only the hinge bends . Good luck .",0

"How do I get free grant/money without spending any ? You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance ( CFDA ) http : //www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http : //www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants . Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.Even if you buy books on `` how to get grants '' or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has , albeit packaged differently . But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.Bear in mind though that it is hard to find grants to start a business . Unlike the myths that some perpetuate , federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business . And yes , grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it , that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born .",0

"What 's your opinion on what will become of American journalist Jill Carroll held hostage in Iraq ? So very sad , I am praying for her and her family . It 's such a frustrating thing . Try to imagine being in her position , she was n't an enemy of her kidnappers and does n't deserve to be where she is now . Her family has got to be completely sick and all the whole world can do is hope the kidnappers come to their senses . This is not the way to accomplish anything , no government can give in to kidnappers demands because if they did there 's be nothing but more kidnapping to get what they want . So we all just sit and hope for the best.I think that no matter what the outcome , the world needs to use this as a way to make people really pay for this kind of act . It can accomplish nothing but more hate and will never profit anyone for their cause . If the world could get with it and realize this it may slow down or stop this kind of action because they 'd realize all they are doing is making themselves less popular and appear to be nothing but psychotic radicals .",0
"Should I feel my husband is cheating on me ? He has cheated before , about 4-5 years ago . I still do n't trust him even though he says he loves me Well , has he ever said he did n't love you when he cheated ? ? People can love someone and still cheat on them . However , just because you do n't trust him , does n't mean he is cheating . Trust is something that people have to earn , and once that trust is broken it can take years to regain , if you ever do . My concentration would be on letting go of the past . You ca n't battle the present if you are still fighting with the past . You have to accept that in the past he cheated , and that you chose to stay with him . This means you have to give him a fresh start . This will not be easy to do , but remember , if he is getting falsely accused or reminded of his past that eventually the past will repeat it 's self . This ia a time of rediscovering the love you have for eachother , and getting to know eachother better . He also needs to be doing everything he can to make you feel secure in your marriage and in his devotion to you . If he is doing certain things that r making you feel as he is cheating , it is best to tell him that these things are bothering you . If he continues with them anyway , then you might have to look at the situation a little more closely to be sure that he is not straying on you . But , do n't let jealousy and self insecurity alone ruin your marriage . Yes , I agree that alot of women have an intuition about these sort of things , but , on the other hand , sometimes it is just a jealous heart looking for something that is n't there . And , when the latter of these two is happening , perfectly good relationships end . Talk to your husband , find closure for the past , and start new . Find out what each of you want and need from the relationship on every level and enjoy loving eachother . My heart goes out to you , I know you are not in an easy situation , and you have alot of hard work ahead of you . But , if you can rediscover the love and passion that once filled your marriage it will all be worth it . Good Luck tou you .",0

"How do you play tennis ? First , you get a partner and get on a tennis court . Then , at the start of the game , choose who will serve first.EX : You serve 1st . Start behind the bottom line of the court on you side . Hit the ball into the opposite square on your opponent 's side of the court . Make sure you do n't pass the little white line in the center . If you do n't in the first try , that is a fault . If the ball hits the top of the net and goes over to the other side , that is a let . Redo . No faults , no points . You get a second try . Try to hit the opposite square on your opponents side of the court . If you miss again , that is a double fault and your opponent gets a point . The score would say 0-15 . ( server 's score is always first ) Now , you switch sides ( from one square to the other ) If you succeed , and he/she ca n't return it , that is called an ace . You get one point ( 15-15 ) Now you go back to where you started . ( It alternates each point ) Now , you serve , and your opponent hits it back to you . It has to go over the net , and in front the line from where you serve , and not in the two boxes at the sides of the court . ( Only in play for doubles ) It is 40-30 now . You score . You win the game . NOT THE WHOLE GAME ! The whole game is called a match . A match is seperated into sets , then games . You win the first set , ( out of your choise , 3 or 5 sets . ) 6-4 .

"If a person has a child in the US , and they themselves are n't citizens , are they entitled to any benefits ? Can they receive Section 8 or welfare benefits for themselves and their child ? Would they be forced to return to their country with the child ? Is citizen status of child enough to gain any benefits ? They are entitled to a limited number of benefits because the US will not take away the child from you ( do n't worry about that unless you prove that you are terrible parents ) Anyway returning to the question - Since the child was born in the US is thus a US citizen . You can confirm that because the child will be issued a Birth Certificate by the state and a Social Security Number by the SS Office . Based on your income your child and for a certain period of time the mother can qualify for medical aid by the govt . You need to get in touch with the hospital 's social workers or the local Social Services Department office . Do that ASAP as the child will need doctor 's visits and routine shots . There are also programs such as Food Stamps and such that will help in the financial for taking care of the child . In case the parents visas expire and have to return back to their country , they can take the baby with them . Just ensure that you have with you the ss , birth certificate , ( I am not sure about the US passport though ) . But rest assured worrying about the citizenship should not be the biggest concern as much as the care of both the `` little baby '' and the mother . Good luck . It 's still good if you can ask an immigration attorney ( remember the first visit is always free @ least in the tri-state ) .",0

"How many Jews are on welfare in the U.S. ? Unfortunately , this information is not found out by the U.S. government so no one can answer your question . However , please note that it is a stereotype that all Jews are rich , so it is definite that there are , indeed , Jews on Welfare . But , most Jews would rather obtain help from the numerous Jewish organizations that offer such help , rather than go public with their problems.A recent national survey , conducted by a Jewish national organization found out the following : :1 ) Total children living in Jewish households with incomes below poverty level : 272,000 2 ) American Jews living below poverty level : 11 % How many or what percent of them are on U.S .

"ARE THERE ANY ACTIVITES FOR THE YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULT CHOIRS ? CHURCH ACTIVITES Depends on what type of `` activities '' you are speaking of.If it is singing activities ... contact the local Civic Center and plan a concert there . Look into local , area , state , or national competitions to enter . Call the local mall to see if you can perform there ( holidays would probably be the best ) .

"Learning english and need help with phrases ! ! ? Please help me with any of these questions！They are talking about horse racing.①man says : “ So I was wondering if maybe you needed some horses looking after．Pretty anxious to train again ” this man has a brokendown horse and he talks to , once was , his owner ( you ) . Does he means he is selling his horse and himself ? ②I 'm asking a job , I 'd even be willing to ... Cut my fee ? Does he mean it would be ok to have low payment if he get a job ? ③Yeah , I think I 'm gon na have to go with the second rule of horse racing . Never beat a dead horse.What is the second rule mean ? 1 . He appears to be asking the man if he needs someone to look after his horses . He is suggesting that he would like to do take this job as he is keen to get back into training horses which is what he has done before.2 . Yes . He is saying that he would be willing to accept less money than normal to do the job.3 . Beat a dead horse ( actually the real expression is - Flog a dead horse ) is an expression which means to do something which has no point because it is already settled . For example , if a child asked his mother for something and she said NO and would not change her mind , then to keep asking can be described as - Beating ( Flogging ) a dead horse . In your example it possibly is referring to the pointlessness of asking for work when none is on offer . But it is also meant to be funny in this case because the subject is actually about horses : - ) The expression probably comes from the pointlessness of beating a horse ( to make it work harder ) if it is dead ! !",0

"Why does my new computer suddenly run very slow when CD-R is accessing data ? ( This is a new problem. ) ? Even when Winamp is playing an mp3 from the hard drive , it will suddenly play very slowly if the CD-R reads something on a CD for another program . It did n't do this when the computer was new ( 3 months ago ) , but just started . instead of ripping CD audio at 18X , it is around 7X now . It 's hard to say what could be the exact cause of the problem , but most problems with speed on a computer somehow tie back to Spyware issues . Many times spyware/adware programs that are running in the background ( depending on which type ) will try to access all your drives ( not only the CD drive , but the HDD as well ) and decrease your machine 's performance . The other possiblity could be a hardware issue , as a technician , I 've seen many times data cables go bad or CD motors fail . You could be running out of RAM , Since the machine is only about 3 months old , i doubt very much it 's hardware ( but i 'd definitely suggest getting the Laser cleaned with a CD laser cleaner ) . The problem is most likely software related ( either spyware or a settings issue ( like a DMA setting or something ) ) . Either way , since you 're more than likely to be under some kind of mfg . warranty , i 'd take advantage and call them up , for some kind of support .",0

"what is prolactaine ? no spasm Prolactin is a hormone synthesised and secreted by lactotrope cells in the adenohypophysis ( anterior pituitary gland ) . Prolactin is made up of 199 amino acids , and has a molecular weight of about 23,000 daltons . Prolactin has many effects , the most significant of which is to stimulate the mammary glands to produce milk ( lactation ) .Increased serum prolactin during pregnancy causes enlargement of the mammary glands of the breasts and increases the production of milk . However , the high levels of estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy acts directly on the breasts to stop ejection of milk . It is only when the levels of these hormones fall after child birth that milk ejection is possible.Sometimes , newborn babies ( males as well as females ) secrete a milky substance from their nipples . This substance is called Witch 's milk . This is caused by the fetus ' being affected by prolactin circulating in the mother just before birth , and usually stops soon after birth",0

"Any economists out there ? Student who needs help ! ! ? I 'm in college , & need help with my macroeconomics class . I took a quiz , and got 5 questions wrong . My teacher is disputing that they 're wrong , but I say they 're right ! ! Thank you in advance for your help . The questions are : The ability-to-pay tax principle ca n't be applied to : ( she said the correct answer was welfare ) . The ability to pay tax principle states that : Those with a greater ability to pay ( such as those with a higher income , or those who own more property ) should pay more taxes . I do n't see how welfare ( or her other choices of post office , & highway ) fit into this principle . Yes , we as users of the highway & post offices pay taxes , ( these services are supplied by the government ) but people that use welfare also pay taxes . The only way I can see this to be a part of it , is that highways can make money by tolls & post offices by postage , & welfare is giving money away to citizens . Thank you , and I have 4 more , but no space to post , so I 'm going to do individual questions . Welfare is essentially a negative tax , which goes right in hand with the ability-to-pay tax principle . They so lack an ability to pay that they are instead paid by the Social Security Insurance tax that everyone who can pay does .",0

Go out and do something fun with them a few times so you can reminisce about those times to break the ice.I really have a tough time coming up with things to talk about with other people , so what I have done is read newspapers and magazines and watch TV that has interests like those of a person I am interested in getting to know . That way I have something to talk about . I never was one for meeting men . That is until one man at work caught my eye . We said polite hellos to each other , but that just was n't enough . I finally got up the nerve to talk to him . I walked right up , stuck out my hand , and said , `` I ca n't believe you have been here this long and I still do n't know your name . '' It impressed him that I was interested in him , and we began to talk and are now in a 2 1/2 year relationship . Sometimes you just have to get the courage to start . The other person will often take over once you make the first move . Smile , be yourself , and take a chance . You never know the great people you might meet !",0

"plossl 's seven supply chain points ? 1 . Satisfy the customer ’ s real needs not wants– For effective supply chain management , the real customers ’ needs must be satisfied , not their wants.2 . Understand how the real world works- The more quickly information moves , the more value it has.The same fact is true for supply chain management.- Being able to execute quickly can remove the need toforecast.- Material will expand to fill the space provided.3 . Have a complete integrated system– A complete system includes both planning and executionmanagement.– Plan will change but to fail to plan in planning to fail.– Changes and variability are expected events . The morequickly an enterprise can react , the less cost is incurred by theoperation.– System effectiveness is inversely proportional to thecomplexity.4 . Accurate data- Without accurate data , the best hardware and software will benothing but a big money pit and provide no return oninvestment.5 . Manage cycle time– Cycle time is the amount of time that elapses between materialentering and exiting a production facility.– Do not release orders to the floor unless all material and capacity isavailable to run it.6 . Eliminate nonvalue-added activity- It is not say that every implementation should embrace “ industrybest practices ” if these processes do not help the enterprise achieveits goals.- Keep implementation costs down rather than driving higher returnon investment.- Eliminating nonvalue-added activity means that one shouldn ’ tautomate bad process.7 . Fully qualified People- What business are they themselves in ? - Where does their work fit into the total business ? - Who are your customers ? What do your customers need ? - Who are your suppliers ? What are their problems ? - What are their tools ( system , data , machinery ) ? Howwell do they use them ? - Who is on their team ? - Who are not yet fully qualified ?

"What is this pain in my back ? For over 3 yrs , I 've had a fist sized area in my left middle part of my back . It feels like it balls up when I bend or reach and sometimes foods and alcohol cause it to really act up and burn . It feels as if sometimes it seizes up and it really hurts . Shortly after this started I gained ALOT of weight . ( I was always very small ) NOW I have high bp , chol , I get dizzy and short of breath . I sweat and my face is puffy and flush almost all the time . Its worse during and right after my period . I have acid reflux and a knotted fist sized ( I assume hernia ) below my left breast area . ( oh , and I am deathly afraid and not very trusting of doctors ) *Have a ball with this one ! A good idea to find out the cause of your back pain is to call Darrow Total Care . Dr. David W.

"Objections to Scott Hahn ? Are there any scholarly objections to Scott Hahn from Protestants ? I am not aware of any , except from the 'common-man ' . Schneb ? If so where can I find these objections ? For spiritual assistance in his conversion Hahn turned to praying the rosary , in which 153 of 170 prayers are offered to Mary . He writes in his conversion story , `` I proceeded to pray [ the rosary ] , and as I prayed I felt more in my heart what I came to know in my mind : I am a child of God . I do n't just have God as my Father and Christ as my brother ; I have His Mother for my own . '' Franciscan University , where Hahn is a professor , is one of the foremost promoters of tours to the shrine of Our Lady of Medjugorje.Now , if you have read my study , `` Seven Letters '' , you would see that there was a woman who deceived the church . According to the timeline , it is the doctrine of Mariology . So I have real problems with anyone who supports or does apologetics to this unbiblical doctrine.http : //www.schneblin.com/studies/pdfs/seven_letters.pdf",0

"Is genodide still happening today ?

In the Sudan there have been in the neigborhood of 2,000,000 people killed in trying to wipe those of their sect off the face of the Earth . Just because it happens in the far reaches of the world from here does not mean that it is not ocurring . The indiscrimanate act of killing in Drive-by shooting 's is just an example of how it is happening in our own country . When we think of genocide we like to think of ages gone by , however our age is probably having more of this type of things as we have much better ways to kill these days . It is still a daily thing it is just buryed in the back pages of the newspaper when it gets reported at all .",0

"what is day saving time ? Daylight Saving Time ( or Summer Time as it is called in many countries ) is a way of getting more out of the summer days by advancing the clocks by one hour during the summer . Then , the sun will appear to rise one hour later in the morning when people are usually asleep anyway , at the benefit of one hour longer evenings when awake : The sunset and sunrise are one hour later than during normal time . DST could save energy ( less artificial light is needed during the evening ) and make the country more efficient in addition to the pleasing effect of lighter evenings . To make DST work , the clocks have to be adjusted one hour ahead when DST begins ( during spring ) , and adjusted back one hour to standard time every autumn . There are many countries observing DST , and many who do not . Benjamin Franklin suggested the method in 1784 , but it was first during World War I , in 1916 in several counties in Europe that DST was adopted , although it was proposed several times before , but rejected .",0

You can even give an overkill expensive chocolate , like a branded-brandy-chocolate.Actually , it will be better if you make the chocolate by yourself ( you better make it delicious ) , but I think boy just ca n't do it .

"Why are n't you doing something more constructive than sitting in front of the computer answering questions ? Very good question Yellow , but only you can answer that question for yourself as the question is ultimately about you . In your question I hear a self-judgment that you are unconstructive with your time . This means that you judge yourself to waste time , or that your time is not valuable since you are doing `` non-constructive '' tasks with it . Perhaps you are a workaholic and resent your coworkers who are spending time on Yahoo ! ANSWERS instead of helping you get the `` important '' things done . Or perhaps it is hard for you to be vulnerable or share your feelings , hence the irony of your question . Either way , it is a good question and a wonderful opportunity for self-knowledge . I invite you to ask yourself why you asked that particular question . Perhaps you just have a good sense of humor . I invite you to consider Eric 's answer above for an example of how to take a risk and answer a question from a vulnerable , yet truthful place . As for me , I agree with the others above who see this as a place to unwind and connect with others . I believe every voice matters , even mine , so I am willing to share it with you and the world . So , I must disagree with you in your judgment : I believe answering questions here is not unconstructive . Rather , a very constructive thing to do with my time , ( to a point . ) Take care of yourself because if you do n't , who will ? U. P.S . And no , I do n't work for Yahoo !",0

"what changed and caused the crisis between great britain and the thirteen colonies ? The steps leading up to the war and their consequences are as follows:1 . Proclomation of 1763 which prohibited the colonist from living west of the Appalachian Mts.-made the colonist mad and many disregarded the proclomation.2 . Britain raising taxes on the colonist to help defray the costs of the French and Indian War-the colonist protested and refused to pay the taxes.3 . Boston Massacre in 1770 which was used as American propoganda against the British when in fact it was a large crowd threatening a small group of British soldiers who either fired accidently or out of fear for their lives4 . Quartering of British soldiers in colonists homes-caused great resentment against the British.5 . Boston Tea Party in which colonist threw tea into Boston Harbor to protest the monopoly given the British East India Trading Company causing the British to pass the Coercive Acts which severly punished Boston.6 . To show support for the Mass . colony all of the colonies except one met at the first Continental Congress and authorized colonies to raise militias , and to boycott British tea.7 . Lexington and Concord April 1775-British troops attempted to capture Sam Adams and a store of arms and powder at Concord , Mass .

"Best way to get into Voice Over work ? Where in the name of heaven do I find job postings for voice over work ? It seems to be a very insular community . Is the only `` in '' through taking high-priced classes ? Maybe I do n't know the best way , but my father is a Voice Actor , and is very successful . He offers great work shops in the L.A. area and often takes serious aspiring voice actors under his wing . I 've noticed that in his field there are some tricks . 1 . Of course you have to have a good agent . He works with a well known agency . 2 . You have to understand the trends of the business . When I was younger , he worked on a lot of cartoons like Duck Tales , Gummi Bears , Bearnstien Bears , Snorks , and a bunch of other ones . But these days , the younger voices seem to be a trend . He has had to tailor his work in a new way to get into the right realm of voice acting again . Good thing he has a great agent . 3 . This is the most important in my opinion . You have to be honest and HARD WORKING . I noticed that a lot of people in entertainment are ego-centric . They wo n't take a job unless it has a great image attached to it . When my father got his job , he took any and every job he could get . The side product was that he became extremely good at it . He has more practice than anybody , and he now bears the nick-name `` one-take Brian '' to most of his collegues in Hollywood . So when a commercial is done and they need to lay the VO tracks on the video ... he 's the man they call in crunch time because they know he 'll get it done fast . He saves sound engineers money on reduced studio time too . So I guess hard work and integrity pay off in a business where there 's a lot of less honest and less hard working people . It 's a great business and he loves it . It 's very lucrative for him too . However , I 've seen a lot of people fail at it . Get out there.. make demos , get your name known , practice your trade , and take what you can get . I hope it works out . If you live in the L.A. area and are interested in a good contact or his workshops , contact me . He has a good repetoire of well known roles and he knows most of the famous Voice Actors out there from Jim Cummings to Gary Owens .",0

"When and how will U.S. Congress and the White House succeed in destroying the Middle Class American ? It is readily apparent that the Wilsonian Global Market Economy has affected the American job market ; and , will continue to so for the next several years.In addition , it is widely known by many who are not deaf , dumb , and blind that the US Government has begun to do so -- more so in the last 20 years.In actuality , the post-industrial era is all but waned and the new supposed service era has begun . Therefore , the middle class income median that thrived throughout the 90s will ( or already has been ) reduced to a mere pittance above minimum wage—otherwise known as , I think , global wage.Still the question remains : “ How soon will the 1 % wealthy succeed in creating a two class society , that will eventually implode in on itself ? ” You know what I think ?

I wonder if this would be caused by my autoresponders to the postmaster @ domain.com address , which , when replying to spam emails with false addresses , might be causing the server receiving my reply to think that my auto-response is spam . If you 're sending mail to the postmasters of domains forged into spam headers , it 's entirely possible you 're hitting some address that feeds the CBL . Note that it 's IP-based , not domain-based , and you can look up your IP address to see its status.My advice is not to use an autoresponder on spam ; the FP rate 's too high unless you have a really , really good parser .",0

Did it hurt using a tampon for the first time ? the best advice is that when trying out tampons for the first time you need to relax ... your vagina is controlled by a muscle and if you 're tense that muscle can tighten up and make it a little uncomfortable to insert the tampon ...

Plenty of perfectly wonderful people are not into showing their bodies naked to the general public .

"When people talk about their `` relationship '' with Jesus , what exactly do they mean ? By characterizing one 's faith in Christ as having a relationship with him , a person implies that that there is an ongoing dialog of sorts ( perhaps non-verbal ) between the believer and the Lord.I mean , if you 've been touched in some way by Jesus once in your life , would n't it be more accurately characterized as an encounter , or an introduction ? Perhaps even an acquaintance ? I recently went to a Starbucks in an unfamiliar town . I paid the girl behind the counter $ 1.70 for my cup of coffee , and left . I do n't believe I will ever see her again . Does that mean I have a `` relationship '' as well ? And if you 've maintained ongoing contact with Jesus , then certainly , you would have sufficient personal experience with your savior to no longer characterize your beliefs as `` faith . '' After all this contact with the Lord , should n't you regard it as `` fact ? `` Just wondering ... It is okay if you think I am nuts but here goes.I talk to God by prayer , sometimes silently and sometimes outloud . God talks to me occassionaly at His time frame , In other words I do n't have to be in a prayerful or spiritual mood for Him to speak . I can not explain it but when He speaks to me , it is not silent in my head and it is not audible so that others can hear it but it is clearly audible to me.So yes , I have a relationship with Him . I also can feel His prescense in my life.Look to John 8:47 , & 10:26-30 Jesus stated my sheep hear my voice and they know me ( Jesus ) and follow me . God may not communicate with everyone the same as He does with me but if you do not hear His voice in some manner then you do n't know Him . My relationship with Him indeed started out as faith but you are correct in the change that takes place . I can not prove this relationship to anyone but to me it is fact . You can not achieve fact without first having faith .",0

"Do you feel that 2 years in the military should be a prerequisite for US citizenship ? My observations have been that the Latino and Black populations comprise most of the minorities in the military . I see this daily at a major US airport . I am not for war but at the same time I feel that , if immigrants want the freedoms which America provides , they should be willing to fight for them . This is a very good question.I do not think it should be required for citizenship , but I do think it could be tied into certain `` benefits '' . I firmly believe that true service would help most people , lower unemployment ( military training translates to outside employment ) , and lessen the `` gim me , gim me , gim me a handout '' crap that is very widespread . Why should people be given welfare when they are able bodied enough to serve in the military ? Why should people squeeze money from the Fed for schooling , when they can earn that benefit by serving in the armed forces ?",0

"how to treat plantar faciitis ? There are several things you can try.Anti-inflammatory medications like Ibuprofen or Naproxen may be helpful , taken with food.Fill an empty soda bottle with water and freeze . With a sock on , roll your heel over the ice bottle for 10-15 minutes , 3-4 times a day.NEVER go barefoot ! NOt even to the bathroom in the middle of the night . Always have good supportive shoes on.Stretching your calf muscle may help , particularly if you have a tight achilles to begin with . Face a wall , and place your plans on it . With the affected leg further behind you , lean into the wall , keeping your back leg straight and the heel on the floor . Then stretch with your knee slightly bent.If these methods do n't work , see your health care provider . A stronger anti-inflammatory medicine may be prescribed , he or she may evaluate you for orthotics , or supports that go into your shoes . Physical therapy may be helpful , and some people even have a cortisone injection into the heel .",0

There are two questions you ask.1 . ) -- Conciousness is strong feeling ( nature of which , by the way is impossible to describe from atheistic perspective ) which hardly gives you a break . Therefore it is hard to live if you steal . However , if someone repeats crime over and over again his conciouseness get used to it more and more so he/she lives pretty good with stealing. -- Also , ( it is not excuse though ) , people can steal for a different purposes ... self-preservation most powerful probably ... 2 ) -- Second question I do n't uderstand .

The petition filed by advocate M.D.Tahir for the said reason was sent to the Chief Justice , requesting him to reconstitute the bench.The petition pertains to 0.24 million people who fought shoulder to shoulder with Pakistan army in East Pakistan in 1971 war and were got stranded in Bangladesh after Dhaka Fall .

"important events during george washingtons presidency ? Key Event : America Signs Treaty with Tripoli.Some more Key Events in President George Washington 's Administration• Precedents -- -Washington established two main precedents : a cabinet and the two-year term.• Whiskey Rebellion , 1794 -- -Washington ordered 15,000 troops to Pennsylvania and crushed the first challenge to federal authority.• Farewell Address , 1796 -- -Washington warned against the evils of political parties and `` tangling alliances '' abroad . On April 30 , 1789 , George Washington , standing on the balcony of Federal Hall on Wall Street in New York , took his oath of office as the first President of the United States . `` As the first of every thing , in our situation will serve to establish a Precedent , '' he wrote James Madison , `` it is devoutly wished on my part , that these precedents may be fixed on true principles . '' Born in 1732 into a Virginia planter family , he learned the morals , manners , and body of knowledge requisite for an 18th century Virginia gentleman . He pursued two intertwined interests : military arts and western expansion . At 16 he helped survey Shenandoah lands for Thomas , Lord Fairfax . Commissioned a lieutenant colonel in 1754 , he fought the first skirmishes of what grew into the French and Indian War . The next year , as an aide to Gen. Edward Braddock , he escaped injury although four bullets ripped his coat and two horses were shot from under him . From 1759 to the outbreak of the American Revolution , Washington managed his lands around Mount Vernon and served in the Virginia House of Burgesses . Married to a widow , Martha Dandridge Custis , he devoted himself to a busy and happy life . But like his fellow planters , Washington felt himself exploited by British merchants and hampered by British regulations . As the quarrel with the mother country grew acute , he moderately but firmly voiced his resistance to the restrictions . When the Second Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia in May 1775 , Washington , one of the Virginia delegates , was elected Commander in Chief of the Continental Army . On July 3 , 1775 , at Cambridge , Massachusetts , he took command of his ill-trained troops and embarked upon a war that was to last six grueling years . He realized early that the best strategy was to harass the British . He reported to Congress , `` we should on all Occasions avoid a general Action , or put anything to the Risque , unless compelled by a necessity , into which we ought never to be drawn . '' Ensuing battles saw him fall back slowly , then strike unexpectedly . Finally in 1781 with the aid of French allies -- he forced the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown . Washington longed to retire to his fields at Mount Vernon . But he soon realized that the Nation under its Articles of Confederation was not functioning well , so he became a prime mover in the steps leading to the Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia in 1787 . When the new Constitution was ratified , the Electoral College unanimously elected Washington President He did not infringe upon the policy making powers that he felt the Constitution gave Congress . But the determination of foreign policy became preponderantly a Presidential concern . When the French Revolution led to a major war between France and England , Washington refused to accept entirely the recommendations of either his Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson , who was pro-French , or his Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton , who was pro-British . Rather , he insisted upon a neutral course until the United States could grow stronger . To his disappointment , two parties were developing by the end of his first term . Wearied of politics , feeling old , he retired at the end of his second . In his Farewell Address , he urged his countrymen to forswear excessive party spirit and geographical distinctions . In foreign affairs , he warned against long-term alliances . Washington enjoyed less than three years of retir",0

"What diet plans that you know of , really work ? Honestly. ? All diets may work temporarilly . Some of them though may leave you malnourished and fatigued . No diet where you eliminate a certain food group or an entire group of foods based on carb intake is good for your body . Drink lots of water , cut out soda . Get rid of the salty , sugary snacks . Eat until you are full of healthy foods . Eat slowly so you will feel your stomach get full . Excercise . If nothing else just go for a walk . Cardio is the best , jogging , jumping jacks ... . Consistency is key . You cant expect pounds to melt off in a matter of weeks that took a lifetime of bad habits to put on . You have to burn fat off .

REVELATION 12:1-1712:1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven ; a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and upon her head a crown of twelve stars : 12:2 And she being with child cried , travailing in birth , and pained to be delivered . 12:3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven ; and behold a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crowns upon his heads . 12:4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child as soon as it was born . 12:5 And she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron : and her child was caught up unto God , and to his throne . 12:6 And the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared of God , that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days . 12:7 And there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels fought against the dragon ; and the dragon fought and his angels , 12:8 And prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more in heaven . 12:9 And the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the Devil , and Satan , which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him . 12:10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , Now is come salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power of his Christ : for the accuser of our brethren is cast down , which accused them before our God day and night . 12:11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb , and by the word of their testimony ; and they loved not their lives unto the death . 12:12 Therefore rejoice , ye heavens , and ye that dwell in them . Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea ! for the devil is come down unto you , having great wrath , because he knoweth that he hath but a short time . 12:13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth , he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child . 12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle , that she might fly into the wilderness , into her place , where she is nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent . 12:15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood . 12:16 And the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth . 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman , and went to make war with the remnant of her seed , which keep the commandments of God , and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .",0

"How do you rate a movie/play ? I 'm very curious about this . My Grandma died four years ago , and just before she died , she took my cousin and I to see Phantom of the Opera . It was her favorite musical . It was the last musical she ever took us to.I told my cousin that now my second favorite musical is Rent , and that my first is Wicked . She asked if there were any other plays that I had cried at . I said I almost cried at Phantom , but it is n't one of my favorite musicals ... I 've never truly been able to love the music . I like it ... but not in the same way I do Wicked or Rent.She got mad , and we fought , but it got me to thinking ... how many people judge a movie or a play based on who they were with/the time the had during it . And how many people can set that aside and judge based solely on the movie or play itself . So , which way do you do it ? I base movies/musicals based solely on my enjoyment of them . It has to be entertaining and a good story , otherwise its not gon na be a favorite . As an aside - I definitely agree about Wicked - I LOVE it ( both because I enjoyed the story and that I saw it for the first time with my best friend . )",0

I was 18 years old me and my mates went out to the a going away party for this Japanese guy . There we hooked up with some Japanese foreign exchange students , One of which fumia , was my friend . She introduced me to her good friend Yuko and nudged her to dance with me . I 'm a pretty funny dancer so we had a good time laughing at me and drinking . Then the party ended and we were walking to an after party and began chatting . I felt a chemistry building with her even though the conversation came a bit difficult . We hung out at the party for about 5 mins when I just could n't deny the chemistry there , so I asked her if she wanted to go for a walk . This time the conversation was much easier and we were alone we walked a block discussing our college lives and asking questions about her experiences in America etc . we headed back to the party and I felt really good about her . On the elevator ride up there was a long awkward silence and just before the elevator reached our floor I took her and kissed her , and then , silence . It was great .",0

"who is william blake ? William Blake ( November 28 , 1757 – August 12 , 1827 ) was an English poet , painter and printmaker . Though largely unrecognised during his lifetime , today Blake 's work is almost universally considered that of a genius . According to Northrop Frye , who undertook a study of Blake 's entire poetic opus , his prophetic poems form `` what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the [ English ] language '' . Others have praised Blake 's visual artistry , in particular his engravings : `` [ Blake ] is far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced '' [ 1 ] .However , viewing Blake 's accomplishments in either poetry or in the visual arts separately is to do him a disservice ; Blake himself saw these two disciplines as being cohorts in a unified spiritual endeavour , and they are inseparable in a proper appreciation of his work .",0

"What is the best AMD64 CPU for multitasker/gamer ? among athlon , athlon x2 , opteron , opteron x2 . price range 400 and under . I highly recommend the Athlon 64 X2 3800+ dual core processor if you are thinking of multitasking . Each core is based pretty much on the Venice core , and has 512 KB L2 cache . Each core runs at 2.0GHz , which is the same speed as the 90 nanometer process Athlon 64 3200+.For about the same price , the best single core processor is the Athlon 64 4000+ , with the San Diego core . It has 1MB of L2 cache . This is likely a better gaming processor than the X2 3800+ , because it has has a 400MHz speed advantage in one thread . It also has a 1MB L2 cache.Currently , all mainstream games are single threaded , meaning that they ca n't utilize the capabilities that dual core processors have . The dual core processor will perform very nicely in the environment of your operating system , but it wo n't have an advantage in gaming . Most people predict that multi-threaded PC games will become more common in the next few years , but there is a good chance they will do nicely on older single threaded systems at lower speeds.When it comes to games , your graphics card is far more important than the speed of your processor . Normal multitasking benefits most from the processor.Overall , I would recommend the Athlon 64 X2 3800+ .",0

"did rachel carson work with animals ? if so what kind ? NAME : Rachel Carson BIRTHDATE : May 27 , 1907 BIRTHPLACE : Springdale , PA EDUCATION : 1925- entered Pennsylvania College for Women ( now Chatham College ) 1929- graduated with honors , earning a scholarship to continue her studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , MD . 1932- M.A . in Zoology from John Hopkins University . FAMILY BACKGROUND : The youngest of three children , Rachel Carson had a rugged upbringing in a simple farmhouse outside the western Pennsylvania river town of Springdale . She credited her mother with introducing her to the world of nature that became her lifelong passion . DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS : After completing her education , Carson joined the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries as the writer of a radio show entitled `` Romance Under the Waters , '' in which she was able to explore life under the seas and bring it to listeners . In 1936 , after being the first woman to take and pass the civil service test , the Bureau of Fisheries hired her as a full-time junior biologist , and over the next 15 years , she rose in the ranks until she was the chief editor of all publications for the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service . During the 1940s , Carson began to write books on her observations of life under the sea , a world as yet unknown to the majority of people . She resigned from her government position in 1952 in order to devote all her time to writing . The idea for her most famous book , Silent Spring , emerged , and she began writing it in 1957 . It was published in 1962 , and influenced President Kennedy , who had read it , to call for testing of the chemicals mentioned in the book . Carson has been called the mother of the modern environmental movement . DATE OF DEATH : April 14 , 1964 PLACE OF DEATH : Her home in Silver Spring , MD PORTRAYED BY : Celeste Earhart WEB SITES : Rachel Carson Homestead Rachel Carson Council Rachel Carson National Wildlife RefugeRachel Carson Forum - a center for `` new ideas and opinions about environmental issues facing Pennsylvania .

"um..i got ta queston ? does anyone know of any kind of product , thats not that expensive for acne . Because i 've tried several different things , but they do n't want to seem to work . Okay 1. what causes acne ? 2.what should I use to clear it ? hormonesFor most people with acne , it begins at puberty . This is when the body starts to produce hormones called androgens . Androgens cause the enlargement and overstimulation of the sebaceous glands in people with acne . Sensitivity to these androgens also cause acne to appear during the menstrual cycle and sometimes in pregnancy . The extra sebum ( oil ) that the sebaceous glands produce mixes with dead skin cells and bacteria on the skin 's surface and this blocks pores . Inside the blocked pore , bacteria multiply and cause inflammation leading to the spots and pustules associated with acne.stressStress can also cause the production of hormones , such as cortisol , which can aggravate acne.other causes * Acne is often genetic * Some medications and steroids * Heavy or oily make up * Over abrasive cleansing o Astringent facial products can dry the skin out causing the body to create even more sebum to compensate o Use of harsh exfoliators can damage existing spots and spread infection o Picking or squeezing of blackheads , whiteheads and spots can send the infection deeper into the skin and cause scarring * A diet high in foods that can aggravate acneou really can get rid of acne , naturally . How ? By learning about the causes of acne and how to rebalance the body . By understanding that applying harsh chemicals to the skin can actually exacerbate the skin 's natural oil production and make acne worse . Why is it that people who do n't eat a Western diet do n't have acne ? You , too , can get rid of acne by understanding why it 's predominantly a Western problem . In parts of the world where a Western diet is being adopted , they are now getting acne.Our bodies are fine-tuned machines , continually creating new cells and getting rid of dead cells . There are three processes vital to human health ; appropriation ( taking in food , air , water etc ) , assimilation ( absorbing nutrients to create new cells ) and elimination ( expelling waste/toxins ) . If any one of these is unbalanced , this can lead to less than vital health . We need to take in the right fuel , use it effectively and get rid of by-products and waste . For example , we get rid of waste via the digestive system , the lungs and the skin ; if the digestive system is sluggish waste may have to be expelled via the skin as blocked pores and acne .",0

"How are white water rafting rapids categorized ? class i : easy . fast moving water with riffles and small waves . few obstructions , all obvious and easily missed with little training . risk to swimmers is slight ; self-rescue is easy.class ii : novice . straightforward rapids with wide , clear channels which are evident without scouting . occasional maneuvering may be required , but rocks and medium sized waves are easily missed by trained paddlers . swimmers are seldom injured and group assistance , while helpful , is seldom needed . rapids that are at the upper end of this difficulty range are designated `` class ii+ '' .class iii : intermediate . rapids with moderate , irregular waves which may be difficult to avoid and which can swamp an open canoe . complex maneuvers in fast current and good boat control in tight passages or around ledges are often required ; large waves or strainers may be present but are easily avoided . strong eddies and powerful current effects can be found , particularly on large-volume rivers . scouting is advisable for inexperienced parties . injuries while swimming are rare ; self-rescue is usually easy but group assistance may be required to avoid long swims . rapids that are at the lower or upper end of this difficulty range are designated `` class iii- '' or `` class iii+ '' respectively.class iv : advanced . intense , powerful but predictable rapids requiring precise boat handling in turbulent water . depending on the character of the river , it may feature large , unavoidable waves and holes or constricted passages demanding fast maneuvers under pressure . a fast , reliable eddy turn may be needed to initiate maneuvers , scout rapids , or rest . rapids may require ômust '' moves above dangerous hazards . scouting may be necessary the first time down . risk of injury to swimmers is moderate to high , and water conditions may make self-rescue difficult . group assistance for rescue is often essential but requires practiced skills . a strong eskimo roll is highly recommended . rapids that are at the upper end of this difficulty range are designated `` class iv- '' or `` class iv+ '' respectively.class 5 : expert . extremely long , obstructed , or very violent rapids which expose a paddler to added risk . drops may contain large , unavoidable waves and holes or steep , congested chutes with complex , demanding routes . rapids may continue for long distances between pools , demanding a high level of fitness . what eddies exist may be small , turbulent , or difficult to reach . at the high end of the scale , several of these factors may be combined . scouting is recommended but may be difficult . swims are dangerous , and rescue is often difficult even for experts . a very reliable eskimo roll , proper equipment , extensive experience , and practiced rescue skills are essential . because of the large range of difficulty that exists beyond class iv , class 5 is an open ended , multiple level scale designated by class 5.0 , 5.1 , 5.2 , etc ... each of these levels is an order of magnitude more difficult than the last . example : increasing difficulty from class 5.0 to class 5.1 is a similar order of magnitude as increasing from class iv to class 5.0. class vi : extreme and exploratory . these runs have almost never been attempted and often exemplify the extremes of difficulty , unpredictability and danger . the consequences of errors are very severe and rescue may be impossible . for teams of experts only , at favorable water levels , after close personal inspection and taking all precautions . after a class vi rapids has been run many times , it 's rating may be changed to an apppropriate class 5.x rating .",0

I know they believe that all spiritual entities are mere forms of `` Buddha consciousness '' , a primordial essence beyond time & space that is STILL not a `` God '' - that 's another form ! I ca n't find this on any of the Buddhist links I 've checked . Sorry for asking something so hard . The phrase Sun of Enlightenment is one ( see reference below ) . Look up references to the Sun-faced Buddha . This is another solar reference.Unlike many religions which attempted to swallow pagan worshippers , Buddhism accepted no outside dogma or symbols except as they enhanced the concept of the Path to Enlightenment . Many in the West have a very hard time understanding what this means .",0

"What is the easiest way to get my wife a visa for entry to america ? If you are a US citizen and she is outside the US , you should apply for a K visa . Depending on where you live , it will take from one month to approximately five months to process . It is a relatively simple application and you can fill it out youself online at www.uscis.gov . You should include some information that proves your relationship with her is not a fraudulent one , like pictures of your wedding , a letter explaining how you met and dated and why you decided to marry . Especially helpful are any children you have together or financial documents in both names . After she is here , she can apply for her permanent residence . I would suggest an attorney for that process because it involves a lot of paperwork , some of which is a bit complicated .",0

"how does one learn to swim well ? I can manage to go swim about 20 mtrs but i am exhausted and cant go any further . Can someone point me to good online swimming lessons and techniques for amateurs . If you are trying to swim freestyle ( crawl ) , switch to an easier stroke , like the sidestroke while you increase your endurance . If you can only swim 20m , then swim 20m , rest , and swim 20m again . Repeat that process . You can time your rests and shorten your rests as you get stronger and increase the number of repititions you do each session . After a while , push yourself to do 40m between stops , then 60 , etc.In my experience , if you can work up to 400m without stopping , you will be past the point where you are struggling in the water.It might be a good idea to have someone look at your stroke and tell you what needs correcting . If you are struggling to make 20m . there are probably a lot of things that you can do to make your stroke more efficient . Find out what they are and work on correcting one thing at a time . Find someone who 's swimming laps when you are at pool , someone who 's stroke looks good , and ask them to look at your stroke . Ask them what the worst thing that you are doing and what they think you should do about it . You 'd be suprised how many people would be happy to help you .",0

"What should I eat or not eat to help prevent a herpes outbreak ? Lysine is one of numerous amino acids that the body needs for growth and tissue repair . It is classified as one of the nine `` essential '' amino acids because you need to get it from outside sources such as foods or supplements -- in other words the body ca n't make it on its own . Researchers are exploring the value of lysine supplementation and the consumption of lysine-rich foods for lowering cholesterol , improving athletic performance , and enhancing recovery after surgery.Some nutritionally oriented physicians and dentists recommend taking lysine during an outbreak of canker sores to speed healing . The exact cause of these tiny but quite painful mouth ulcers is unclear , but most research indicates that a virus is responsible . However , there have been almost no clinical trials using lysine as a remedy for canker sores.The most promising application of lysine is its use in managing and preventing painful and unsightly herpes sores caused by the herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) .Specifically , lysine may help to : # Prevent and relieve cold sores ( herpes ) . Exciting research over the past several decades suggests that lysine may be helpful in controlling herpes simplex-related infections . There are two types of this virus : type 1 , which typically causes cold sores or fever blisters around the mouth , and type 2 , which tends to cause genital sores . However , both forms can cause eruptions around the mouth or on the genitals . Once infected with the virus , you have it permanently . It may lie dormant , but it does n't go away . Outbreaks are usually painful and unsightly , as well as contagious.A few years ago , researchers discovered that in order to grow ( replicate ) , the herpes virus needs arginine , another common amino acid . ( Foods high in arginine include chocolate , peanuts , almonds , seeds , cereal grains , gelatin , and raisins . ) Lysine competes with arginine for absorption and entry into tissue cells . And when lysine is present , it inhibits the growth of HSV by knocking out arginine.This makes a diet high in lysine and low in arginine a useful tool in managing HSV infections . In a recent study , participants consumed large amounts of lysine ( about 1 gram three times each day ) while restricting food sources of arginine . A significant number of participants ( 74 % ) noticed an improvement in their HSV infections and a decrease in the number of outbreaks.-As a side note , broccoli is also one of the better vegetable to help your body in keeping outbreaks at bay .",0

You COULD stay in bed - flat - for 3 days and see if it gets better ... the `` red hot inflamed '' nerve may calm down a bit and you might feel better ... you could take Aleve to calm the inflamation of the nerve ... you could get a shot of Cordisone in the spine ... anywhichway ... you need to see a neurologist who will take an MRI and tell you if you need surgery . In my case I am overweight and they did not want to touch me `` with a ten foor pole '' . I healed mine by going the other way ...

"Can someone please explain me the blowfish algorithm ? Hi , I am using the blowfish algorithm for my project . I read the paper that Bruce wrote , but couldnt understand it fully ... .Can please some explain it to me ? ? Please ... dont paste the same thing that is on the website , tell me what you understand ! Thankyou ! ! ! IT is a Copy Paste But may be of some use ... .BlowFishBlowFish/TwoFish is a widespread security algorithm , which was published by Bruce Schneier in the beginning of the year 1994 . This algorithm works similar to DES and it uses block coding with blocks of a size of 64 bit . BlowFish was spread very fast after its publication , due to the fact that Bruce Schneier is one of the most famous cryptology experts and that this algorithm can be used without licence fee . In addition , using this algorithm data can be en- and decoded with high speed . If the routine for BlowFish is implemented in software , a disk space of less than five kilobytes is sufficient . You can vary the size of the key as as you like up to 448 bit . That is why this algorithm with its 2 448 different possibilities is protected against any Brute Force Attacks . This is how the encryption algorithm BlowFish works : BlowFish defines two different S boxes , a P box and four S boxes . The P box P is a one-dimensional field with 18 32-bit-values . The boxes contain accidental values , which are implemented in the code or generated during each initialization . The S boxes S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 contain 256 32-bit-values each . The BlowFish initialization looks like this : The key string is converted into 32-bit-values . The entire content of the P box is substituted by the values xor ’ t . The P box is now encrypted like the S box . BlowFish encryption ( block size : 64 Bit , rounds ( r ) : 16 ) : The data element is divided into two parts L and R , each of 32 bit . L is xor ’ t with P r. R is xor ’ t with f ( L ) . L and R are interchanged . This is done 16 times , until r =16 . R is xor ’ t with P 17 . L is xor ’ t with P 18 . Explanation of function f : The incoming 32-bit-value ( L in this case ) is divided into four 8-bit-vectors X1 , X2 , X3 , X4 . With the help of these vectors a 32-bit-value is selected from every S box . The result is linked by addition and xor . For decoding data , the entire process is performed the other way round .",0

An attenuator is used to reduce the level of a signal . A single attenuator will not work the same with any load , because the input and output impedances of the attenuator should be matched to the characteristic impedances of the system in which it is used.One of the simplest forms of attenuator is a resistive T or pi network , which is basically just an electronic `` divider '' circuit .

"whats the best way to fight a cold ? The best way to fight the common cold virusEvery year , as each winter season approaches us , it gets harder and harder for people to avoid getting a cold . It never fails , just as soon as the weather changes a little and starts to turn cold , people begin to sniffle , sneeze and cough and the symptoms of the common cold begin to come around once again.But before you run out to the nearest store to buy a supply of tissues , cold medicine and soup , you need to understand exactly what you are up against . Your chances of being exposed to a cold germ will increase or decrease depending on the amount of contact you have with other people and how you take care of yourself.The cold germ is spread from person to person when someone , who is infected , sneezes or coughs into the air or on you . The airborne germ then enters someone else ’ s body through an orifice , like your eyes , nose or mouth . You can also catch a cold by touching something that a person who has been infected has also touched and then touching your mouth , nose or eyes.There are many things that you can do to prevent yourself from getting a cold.1 . You should wash your hands a lot . This frequent hand washing , especially when using any anti-bacterial soap , will help you to get rid of any potential germs that you might have come into contact with.2 . You should carry and use anti-bacterial hand lotion several times throughout the day . Use it especially when you can not get to a bathroom and you know you have touched something infected or have been near an infected person.3 . You should also get plenty of sleep or rest . If you are tired and fatigued , your body ’ s resistance decreases and you will find that you are more susceptible to colds.There are many ways that you can fight a cold once you have caught one.1 . You should eat spicy foods . Spicy hot foods will cause your body to expel mucus . When you eat these types of foods , your nose will start to run and you will begin to cough up mucus . Spicy foods work just like a natural decongestant but without side effects . This advice is good for those people who can not take over the counter medication.2 . You should drink plenty of liquids . Liquids like soup , water , juice and flat ginger ale will keep your body hydrated . This is true especially if you have a fever . During a fever , your body loses a lot of fluids . You will need to replenish what you have lost . Therefore you need to drink often throughout your illness . You should also avoid drinking any dairy drinks because the dairy will cause mucus to form and coat your throat making it very difficult for you to swallow and cough.3 . You should use a vaporizer . It will keep the air that you breathe moist . If you do not have a vaporizer handy , then just crack open the windows in your home . This is very important if you have an extremely warm and dry home . Cracking the windows will have the same effects that a vaporizer has .",0

"Where did the wedding custom of the bride wearing white come from ? The tradition of wearing white at weddings began due to the choice of colour of the wedding dress of Queen Victoria at her wedding to Prince Albert . Queen Victoria was not the first royal bride to wear a white wedding gown , but the first of the modern era . White had been a traditional colour of royal mourning , and although not often utilized as such , white was not considered a suitable choice for a royal wedding . Victoria 's choice popularized the white gown as no other had before her . Previously , brides wore their best clothes or the most expensive new clothes they could afford . Gold or gold-threaded dresses became popular with royal brides ; the rank-and-file wore dresses that reflected their station . White was one of many choices , pastel shades were also popular .",0

"How did `` black comedy '' and `` rap music '' evolved from minstrel shows in America ? Minstrel shows were obstensibly a caricature of African-American culture , reaching the height of their popularity in the mid-19th Century.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_showBy and large , rap and hip-hop developed in the 1970 's as a natural progression from disco , jazz , beat poetry , raggae , and other African Diasporic cultural genres interacting with each other and creating something new.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_musicHumor , as an entertainment genre , created and performed by African-Americans does n't have much of a presence in American popular culture until the 70's.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_sitcomhttp : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special : Search ? search=african+american+comedians & go=GoIn this way , there 's not much of a direct relationship between minstrel shows and contemporary African-American entertainment in terms of `` lineage . '' However , racism - of which minstrel shows are one example - is a frequent topic of discussion.Example - In the `` When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong '' sketch of Chappelle 's Show Season 2 episode 7 : Dave plays Vernon Franklin , an African-American yuppie who feels like an `` Uncle Tom '' because he likes and gets along with his white co-workers . So instead of letting an awkward comment from co-worker and mentor Frank Murphy slide , he over-reacts.Frank : Vernon , great job buddy . You da man ! Give me some skin , huh ? Vernon : Get your m*f*in hand out of my face , man . You heard me m*f*er get your hand out of my face ! What you think this is - just shake my hand like a man ! .. ' Gim me some five , on the black-hand side , with all this crazy jive ' ? That 's b*s* . Do you want a little soft-shoe ? Should I juggle some watermelon ? Man ; f* all that ! Obviously , the humor is in the over-reaction . But at the same time , Chappelle is tapping into the sensitivity many people have concerning racial stereotypes : The comment about `` dancing a soft-shoe '' is a direct reference to minstrel show caricaturing of African-Americans .",0

"is it good to sleep in a bra ? just wanted to know.. Sleeping with a bra on will not prevent your breasts from growing . However , it 's generally a good idea not to sleep with a bra on because it can interfere with good circulation and easy breathing.If you 're putting in overtime with your bra to preserve perkiness , that 's a total myth . Bras do n't preserve the shape or perkiness of breasts . Sagging results from a number of factors unrelated to bra wearing , such as* breast fat and tissue composition* softening of breast ligaments and loss of breast tissue with age* enlarged breasts during pregnancy , which causes the skin to stretch even after they revert to pre-pregnancy size .",0

"What is the different between Website and Weblog ? A weblog is an online personal journal that is regularly updated on a sometimes daily basis , with a timestamp ( date of posting ) and a byline ( credit of who authored it ) . In other words , it 's nothing more than a cyber version of a diary , in which the author will post thoughts , ideas , feelings , and stories whenever the mood strikes . As opposed to a regular web site , a post can literally be published in *real time* . As a result , blogs tend to be more spontaneous and freeform than regular web sites , since the authors can publish their thoughts instantaneously . They also tend to be more personal , since blogs are usually places in which authors talk about events in their personal lives , observations , or whatever feelings they may be having at the moment.But not all blogs are personal . Some have just been places for people to post news items that they are interested in , or a gathering place for more than one person to merely post their views about current political , social , cultural or other interesting news events of the day .",0
"Would Americans like for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state ? Puerto Rico has been a colony for more than 100 years of the US and once again the isue has come up to decide for its political future , independence or statehood . I 'm sure Americans do n't want Puerto Rico to become a state . With a population larger than that of many other states , PR would be more powerful in Congress than those less populated states.As to FL Boy 's answer , I 'd say that although it would never become a major player , as an independent nation , PR definitely would n't be worthless in the world 's economy . it happens that PR is the world 's largest producer of prescription medicines and pacemakers.My comment on One 's answer is that thousands of Puerto Ricans serve and have served in all of the military branches of the U.S . They have also fought and died in the wars fought by the US , including Iraq and Desert Storm . During the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) , the 65th Infantry Division , made up entirely of Puerto Ricans , kicked some seroius North Korean behinds . So as you can see , the Island 's protection from the US Military HAS had a very high cost to Puerto Ricans.And please , do n't get me wrong . I am totally against freeloaders on welfare , be them white Americans , African Americans or even Puerto Ricans .",0

The latter phenomenon is a recurring experience of people chronically deprived of sleep or suffering amphetamine/cocaine psychosis .

"what are treadmills good for working out ? what do they tone up ? They 're good for your lower torso and your legs . That 's pretty much it .

Of course , I 'm a bit biased , because I used to work at NordicTrack ... but I have to admit , I worked OUT when I worked there ; and I DID see improvement in my entire body . Thing is , most treadmills , you use your legs only . If you really want a great workout , and to really tone up your muscles ( meaning to lose baby fat , get ripped , no spare tire , no water retention , etc. , etc ... . ) you need an overall cardiovascular workout . While a treadmill is good for that , you should consider a workout that encompasses the entire body for that will tone you up so much faster than if you did it halfway.Besides ... when those exercise videos say they can help you tone up your abs , or build up a certain body part ... DO N'T fall for it ! ! It does n't work THAT way ! In order to lose weight from a CERTAIN area of your body , you have to lose it EVERYWHERE on your body !

Just let him go on and do whatever it is that he is doing , and you do the same . There are plenty of other guys out there just waiting to be found . good luck to you !",0
"An ounce of high grade pot can have a street value higher than an ounce of gold . Why not legalize and tax ? It is less harmful than liquor and tobbacco . I could not possibly agree more with you . People are so reluctant to legalize marijuana because it has such a bad reputation . Of course , it gets that reputation because it is illegal and people pass judgment on it based solely on that fact . If you stop looking at the actual legality of it and just think about it morally it is a vice no worse than many others that americans find perfectly acceptable . Anything can be abused . People abuse alcohol , cigarettes , fast food , gambling and countless things which are perfectly legal and socially acceptable , but somehow so many people think smoking weed is just wrong.I can hardly see how continuing to make it illegal will benefit anyone . It only allows drug dealers to set the standards of production/regulation etc . all the while evading taxes . Making it illegal probably does not really curtail the use of the drug either . Did prohibition curtail the use of alcohol ? nope . did it increase crime ? yes.Legalize it and regulate it . Everyone wins . The potheads wo n't have to worry about getting locked up . The government can make some more cash . And we wo n't continue to whaste our time prosecuting potheads and enforcing rediculous laws that combat marijuana use at the expense of taxpayer 's dollars.aside from these reasons , weed just is n't that bad . It is not physically addictive ( as is alcohol/tobacco ) , it does not have the reputation of making people violent/abusive ( as does alcohol ) , it is not as closely associated with recklessness ( as is alcohol ) and when was the last time you threw up or had a hangover from smoking some weed ? never.Legalize it ! !",0

"Do you believe in extraterrastrial life ? A matter of Time or Space ? I believe in celestial life and terrestrial life ... 1 Corinthians 15:39-5839 All flesh is not the same flesh : but there is one kind of flesh of men , another flesh of beasts , another of fishes , and another of birds . 40 There are also celestial bodies , and bodies terrestrial : but the glory of the celestial is one , and the glory of the terrestrial is another . 41 There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for one star differeth from another star in glory . 42 ¶ So also is the resurrection of the dead . It is sown in corruption , it is raised in incorruption : 43 it is sown in dishonor , it is raised in glory : it is sown in weakness , it is raised in power : 44 it is sown a natural body , it is raised a spiritual body . There is a natural body , and there is a spiritual body . 45 And so it is written , The first man Adam was made a living soul ; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit . 46 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual , but that which is natural ; and afterward that which is spiritual . 47 The first man is of the earth , earthy : the second man is the Lord from heaven . 48 As is the earthy , such are they also that are earthy : and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly . 49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy , we shall also bear the image of the heavenly . 50 Now this I say , brethren , that flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God ; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption . 51 ¶ Behold , I show you a mystery ; We shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed , 52 in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trump : for the trumpet shall sound , and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed . 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption , and this mortal must put on immortality . 54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption , and this mortal shall have put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory . 55 O death , where is thy sting ? O grave , where is thy victory ? 56 The sting of death is sin ; and the strength of sin is the law . 57 But thanks be to God , which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ . 58 ¶ Therefore , my beloved brethren , be ye steadfast , unmovable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord .",0

"Is illiteracy , unemployment and over population in the Muslim nations , the main reason for terrorism ? No . The reason terrorism targets America is because they feel like we interfer with their internal politics when we put troops in Saudia Arabia in 1990 and fought Iraq in Gulf War 1 . Shortly thereafter is when you see all these attack start against America.The reason why America does this stuff wether you agree or disagree is oil . People told Bush 1 you have to go out there and say you are doing this for the people of Kuwait but the real reson was oil and we ca n't tell the American people that.Remember no blood for oil ? I never believed it , until the last few months when I saw on History Channel people who advised Bush 1 saying thats what happened.They are n't that bad over there . They just hate us cause we get in the way of their making profit with oil . So the rich people hire the terrorist bosses to do these things.And vwahala , oil is more expensive.So from that perspective if we wanted to save money on oil , WE SHOULD HAVE STAYED OUT OF THIS MESS IN THE FIRST PLACE .",0

"What are the best studio monitor speakers for under $ 500 ? I assume here that you are asking about nearfield active monitors , and that you are aiming for sub- $ 500 for the pair ( not each ) . There are a few factors which play into the decision , including ( a ) the type of music you will be working with , ( b ) your workstation setup , and ( c ) the room.The type of music can determine whether or not you need a subwoofer . If you do , that 's an additional component which you will need to factor into your overall budget.The workstation setup will play into the positioning and power of the speakers . How much space do you have ? Where will the speakers go , and will they be near any walls or corners ? How will they be positioned relative to your head ? ( assuming nearfield ) The room can play a bit into the monitor decision , but it 's probably a bit more of a factor in tuning your setup once you have your monitors . Look into room acoustics as you 're making your monitor decision to understand what your overall monitoring/room setup will entail.Having thought a bit about the above , the key thing for monitors is to have something sufficiently detailed and revealing to make accurate mixes . Ideally , it wo n't be too fatiguing , as you will most likely be listening to them for extended periods of time . On top of that , it 's mostly a matter of getting accustomed to them so you can make accurate mixing decisions . The net of all of this is that monitor choices are fairly personal . Keep in mind that the goal is to get something accurate which will allow you to hear everything you need to hear , which is NOT the same as `` sounding good '' . Take some CDs and audition your top candidates against music you know well , focusing on key portions that highlight particular ranges or potential problem areas ( extended low bass , detailed highs , stereo imaging , etc . ) It can help to take some of your own mixes , if possible.Some specific inexpensive monitors I 've heard good things about are the KRK Rokits and the lower-end Events . Again , the key is to be familiar with the speakers so you can make accurate mixes .",0

"Does anyone Really believe that a `` terrorist '' would stand and fight in Iraq ? How could anyone think a Terrorist would face a U. S. A . Marine in Iraq. ? That makes no sense . Terrorist are cowards . They do the dirty work behind your back not face to face . The biggest problem in Nam that got our boys killed was not knowing friend from foe . Iraq is no different than Nam . Iraq is now in Cival War for Control of the oil money . Greed is at work . Yes , I do . Do n't forget that these terrorists are raised from birth to hate westerners in general and Americans in particular . They are shown videos of Americans dying from a very young age in the madrassas . They are conditioned to believe that if you die in jihad , it is an instant ticket to heaven.Now what I am going to say next may seem a bit offensive to Americans , but it is not meant to be . In order to beat the terrorists , we have to start understanding them ... we have to start thinking like them . To a terrorist , conducting warfare as they do is not cowardly . It is cowardly by western standards , but not by eastern standards . Terror has been a part of Asian warfare for thousands of years . And this is not the first time Americans have seen these tactics . The Viet Cong used them first against France and then against the United States to beat both countries . Suicide bombers , roadside bombs , combatants dresses as civilians ... talk to any Viet Nam combat vet and they will tell you.And do n't forget this , either : Back in the 1770s , our Founding Fathers were considered terrorists . They adapted a lot of tactics from the Indians which was unknown to European armies . We could not win in a face-to-face stand up fight , so we fought `` dirty '' - at least by the standards of the day .",0

"Have i screwed myself over ? If i slacked off for the first two years of highschool and failed a lot of classes , but now in my third year am making A 's and B 's have i screwed myself out of going to a good college like a University ? Not necessarily . Many colleges look at both your overall gpa and your last two years gpa . So , hopefully you will do very well this year and next year . Remember that you only have two more semesters to get grades before most applications are due ( you have this spring 's grades and next fall 's grades ) so it is critical that you do well . Remember , that gpa is one very important factor in admissions , but most colleges also want you to have high SAT or ACT scores , so you need to prepare for doing well on this test . You can study for it , and I like to have people study for it by buying a bunch of practice tests and taking a practice test a week for 8-12 weeks . Take a test , score it , and then look up every item you got wrong . Then repeat . You should see your scores improving.Finally , colleges really do want to see that you have some significant interests within and outside of school . So , you also need to show that you have leadership potential , or talent , or community impact . Clubs , hobbies , and community service can all be a part . Finally , you really need to be able to do a good personal statement . It probably would be helpful to address your poor grades , why you had them and what you learned about yourself so that you could turn it around . Be able to address your values and why you and the school you are applying to are a good match . Hang in there , do well , and remember that college applications are multifaceted .",0

"Why was an embargo put on Cuba ? `` When , on January 7 , 1959 , Fidel Castro assumed control of Cuba after President Fulgencio Batista fled on December 31 , the U.S. government initially supported the Cuban Revolution , formally recognizing the new government . However , relations rapidly deteriorated when the new Cuban government passed the first Agrarian Reform Law to begin expropriation of large-scale ( largely American-owned ) land holdings on May 17 , 1959 . The compensation offered ( based on 20-year bonds at 4.5 % interest for the tax-assessed value ) was seen as inadequate , and was rejected by American interests . Animosity escalated with the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis . After that , the U.S. promised never to invade Cuba again , but resorted to financial measures instead . `` This embargo initially caused damage to the Cuban economy , but 45 years later , has very little effect . This is why many ( aside from GW Bush ) have called for lifting the embargo .",0

"What are modern japanese attitudes toward suicide ? Suicide has been a very serious issue in Japan . There are many school kids ( not many but some ) committing suicide .

The trains in Tokyo often stop and delay because of the suicidal accidents . Workers commuting to work just get so depressed and there are ppl who just jump in to the rail while the train is coming .

"Should my router and modem be the same model ( Linksys ) to function at top capability ? I have an SBC modem and ( wired ) Linksys router . I have tried to connect my laptop to my network , but the router does not seem to configure while using the modem . When I plug the laptop into the SBC modem directly , everything works well . Any help on this is appreciated . Thanks . Well , it depends on the router and how your IP address is assigned but it sounds like to me you are going to have to go into your routers configuration and either tell it to detect the DHCP settings and your IP address automatically or you will have to specify it manually . My experience in this matter ( I have set up four DSL and two cable installations ) is that it should be assigned automatically if the router is n't detecting those ( i.e . the process of detecting it fails ) then the router is probably defective , I had that happen to a Netgear router , it would n't detect either one , I exchanged it for another one and the new one worked perfectly . So if auto detection does n't work , it 's probably the router.For more instructions select your model from the link below and see the user manual .",0

"How do Formula 1 drivers shift gears ? Paddle shift . There are 2 paddles behind the wheel , one on the right , one on the left . Right is upshift , left is downshift . You pretty much just tap it by doing a squeeze/inward motion with your fingers . And they do n't need to use a clutch , it 's a sequential gearbox so instead of shifting to a gear ( like 4th straight to 1st ) , you shift 4th > 3rd > 2nd > 1st in order . But thanks to their superlight clutchpads and flywheels , shifts are super quick , so you can shift rapidfire .",0

"How far will the Cincinnati Bengals go this football season ? This really all depends on how well the Cincinnati Bengals handle the pressure of the playoffs and how well the defense plays . Cincinnati Bengals rank 11th in total rushing yards , 6th in total passing yards and 4th in total Offense yards . Making them among the best offensive teams in the NFL today and the team is still young and learning how to work with each other.On the other hand the defense has been a nightmare . Only good thing going for the defense is the fumbles recovered and interceptions they have made this year , which plays a big role in why they are where they are now . The defense has allowed a total 1522 rushing yards , allowed 2735 passing yards and are ranked 24th in the NFL overall in yards allowed.In order to get to the SuperBowl the defense must step up and make the big plays , there is no room for error in the playoffs . I think they can get the 2nd seed in the AFC , with games left with only one team that has a winning record and good team . The other two games are against the coachless Lions and the Bills who are both no where near the playoffs . I like the Cincinnati Bengals chances of going to the SuperBowl and winning it , just do n't bet on it , unless the defense comes to play .",0

"when was karate invented ? Karate is a multi-cultural development , absorbing the contributions of many gifted practitioners over time and crossing many borders . Compiling a reasonably accurate history of Karate is challenging.The development of Karate occurred chiefly in Okinawa and China in the 19th century , and Japan in the early 20th century . This was an especially turbulent period in history for that area of the world , including Japan 's official annexation of the Okinawan island group in 1874 , the First Sino-Japanese War ( 1894-1895 ) , the Russo-Japanese War ( 1904-1905 ) , and the rise of Japanese expansionism ( 1905-1945 ) . The wars caused disruptions and upheaval , and incentives for concealment . The Karate styles within Japan have fairly clean lineages ; but any assessment of how Karate crossed borders in this period is complicated by issues of nationalism , the historic Japanese racism faced by non-Japanese Asians , and the typical resentment of occupied peoples toward a conqueror . Many recognizeable offshoots of Karate , particularly in Korea , deny the name because of nationalistic ideals and the word 's association with Japan ; likewise , some obvious offshoots of Karate are disowned by Japanese practitioners , perhaps because of a Japanese preoccupation with primacy or purity . [ edit ] Karate 's Origins in OkinawaJapan annexed the nominally independent Okinawan island group in 1874 after centuries of strong Japanese influence over the kingdom 's affairs . One might suggest that something of `` Okinawan '' origin ( such as Karate ) could be equally desribed as being of `` Japanese '' origin . The relationship between Okinawa and Japan is complicated . For purposes of discussing Karate , it is convenient to speak of Okinawa and Japan as separate entities . The question of whether Karate is Japanese or Okinawan is somewhat akin to asking whether the luau or the hula dance are American traditions or Hawaiian ones . They developed in Hawaii prior to when Hawaii became one of the United States , and so are usually described as Hawaiian , not American . Similarly for Karate , which is of Okinawan origin . [ edit ] HistoryKarate is a mixture of indigenous Okinawan fighting arts and empty-handed Chinese fighting arts , the latter having been brought to Okinawa by political envoys , merchants , and sailors to and from Fujian Province . Estimates of the amount of Chinese influence vs. Okinawan influence in modern Karate vary considerably , from 40 % Chinese/40 % Okinawan/20 % other to 80 % Chinese/20 % Okinawan . Some believe that there is also a Japanese jujutsu influence stemming from the long Japanese presence on Okinawa.In 1722 , Sakugawa , who had studied pugilism and staff fighting in China , started teaching a fighting art in the city of Shuri that he called `` Karate-no-sakugawa . '' This was the first known recorded reference to the art of Karate ( 唐手 ) in a modern form . The word `` Kara '' ( 唐 ) referred to China itself , and `` Te '' ( 手 ) meant hand , in the sense of a style of fighting ; so Karate meant `` the Chinese techniques '' or `` Tang Hand '' .To this day Karate still bears a striking resemblance to Fujian martial arts such as Fujian White Crane , Five Ancestors , and Goroquan ( Hard Soft Fist , pronounced `` Gōjūken '' in Japanese ) . For the most part there were no particular styles of `` te '' , but rather a network of practitioners with their own individual methods and eclectic traditions . Early styles of karate can be generalized as Shuri-te , Naha-te and Tomari-te , named after the three cities in which they emerged . Each city ( and the teachers who lived there ) had particular kata , techniques , and principles that distinguished its local version of te from the others.Around the 1820 's , Sokon Matsumura taught a synthesis of te ( Shuri-te and Tomari-te ) and Shaolin ( Chinese 少林 ) styles . It would become the style Shorin-Ryu ( `` Little Forest '' ) . Matsumura taught his karate to An",0

"nursing care plan who had post op TAH-BSO ? Are you a nursing student with lack of resources ? Anyone who has had this medical procedure needs to carefully follow her doctor 's advice and report any signs or symptoms which could indicate complications.I had it done . Other than report anything which seems abnormal ( and do n't let strange things shock the nurse or whoever , get a serious response in the rare event it does happen- such as passing gas or stool vaginally ) . Things I found helpful was support the abdomenal area with a folded blanket or pillow when getting up or coughing or sitting in a chair even . Once you go on a regular diet be sure to get lots of fluids , eat foods that give bulk to your stool without the extra gas and walk as much as your doctor allows you to without over doing it . It is very important to avoid constipation which can stretch your colon into a pouch . That pouch could cause problems for years to come . Just let your doctor know if constipation does become an issue . Get your rest and push yourself a bit more each day as you are able to tolerate it . The healing process needs time , but you will get there . If you are a nursing student , I would strongly suggest you invest in a care plan book with information that you need to know in order to provide the proper care to your patients . Good luck .",0

That will surely help you.Troubles come into our life for a reason . They are there to give us a new perspective or to help us discover our hidden power which we have n't discovered yet .

Try to join a church or a spiritual group which would help in giving you a different perspective . Try to look at the brighter side of things when things look down . Look at how happy you 'd be when all problems are solved . Having a positive attitude and looking at the brighter side of things helps getting thru ' times like this.I 'd suggest that you do the following . Look at the problems and prioritize them . Dont look at all problems at the same time . Tackle one thing at a time . Give priority to problems that ca n't be postponed and try to resolve them . Again , try to look at the brighter side of things . Things will be in a better shape soon . A couple of stanzas from HW Longfellow 's `` The psalm of life '' to keep you going.Not enjoyment , and not sorrow , Is our destined end or way ; But to act , that each to-morrowFind us farther than to-day.In the world 's broad field of battle , In the bivouac of Life , Be not like dumb , driven cattle ! Be a hero in the strife ! Lives of great men all remind usWe can make our lives sublime , And , departing , leave behind usFootprints on the sands of time ; Footprints , that perhaps another , Sailing o'er life 's solemn main , A forlorn and shipwrecked brother , Seeing , shall take heart again.Let us , then , be up and doing , With a heart for any fate ; Still achieving , still pursuing , Learn to labor and to wait .",0

"What 's the point of having school ?

"How do you explain this ... . ? 50 % of all auto accidents are alcohol related , but only 40 % of those accidents are actually caused be the driver that was drinking . MADD claims that drunks could have prevented some of those accidents if their reaction time which was impaired by alcohol were eliminated . However if 60 % of all accidents that involve alcohol are caused by the sober person , if everyone quit drinking and driving if you go by the stats supplied by MADD , the amount of accidents would actually rise around 30 % . From a purely mathematical perspective , you 're right . But of course this would eliminate using the proper logic that the lack of alcohol intake makes for fewer impaired drivers that would be unable to effectively avoid an accident.Either way , do n't drink and drive ... you might spill your drink .",0

"how is elementary school running in USA ? i.e. , financial support , administration roles , evaluation process , et My kids are going to elementary school , but I am not sure what is the current status of the system , in particularly I am interested in : ( 1 ) where the system gets its financial support ; ( 2 ) how to evaluate the system ; ( 3 ) who is in charge of the system ( 4 ) what are the requirements for the teachers and other staff ( 5 ) what are the roles of federal , state , and local goverments ( 6 ) what are the roles of parents and children themselvesThanks ! This varies wildly from state to state , from county to county , and from school to school . In the U.S. we have both public ( free attendance , supported by tax money ) and private schools .

"How do you start looking for Venture Capital Funding ? For an online company , located in a small rural area , that has been in business for over 5 years , how does one go about attracting venture capital funds and investors ? Venture Capital is just another name for private investor . There are some private investor groups but they are not well advertised . Typically a venture capitalist does not engage in the business of private investing because there is usually no or very little return on the investment . They expect to get their money back at best .

The chamber of commerce in your city and the state will provide you with local information . Often , those groups will point you in the right direction for fund raising .

"M SECOND RIDDLE ? ? A rich man 's son was kidnapped . The ransom note told him to bring a valuable diamond to a phone booth in the middle of a public park . Plainclothes police officers surrounded the park , intending to follow the criminal or his messenger . The rich man arrived at the phone booth and followed instructions but the police were powerless to prevent the diamond from leaving the park and reaching the crafty villain.How did the kidnaper get away with the valuable diamond ? When the rich man reached the phone booth he found a pigeon in a cage . It had a message attached telling the man to put the diamond in a small bag which was around the pigeon 's neck and to release the bird . When the man did this the police were powerless to follow the bird as it returned across the city to its owner . Am I right ?",0

"What is a Rife Generator and how does it work ? I 'll post here my answer that I gave when another person asked the same question a month or so ago.The Rife machine is legit depending on what model or manufacturer you got it from . There was a company in the late 80 's to early 90 's called LER that made what they named the REM SuperPro Generator . Though I ca n't vouch for any of the newer models , I can say that Rife 's technology was right on if you can find an original model.YES it shattered cancer cells , YES he was heralded as having found the cure for all diseases , YES he had 100 % success rate on the patients in the Pasadena county hospital . A Rife machine uses scalar waves , along the now established fact that every organism operates at its own distinct frequency . By increasing the resonance , a particular organism can be destroyed without harming the tissue around it . Rife meticulousy recorded the M.O.R . ( mortal oscillatory rate ) for the thousands of micro-organisms he could see under his universal microscope . A properly built Rife frequency generator can not hurt , except for a brief healing crisis , followed by an incredible feeling of health and well-being taken from years of testimonials ( unless you have a pacemaker from what I 've heard ) . A good amount of reading on Rife 's story can be found at some of the links below.Unfortunately most of his work was destroyed because of the newly created AMA and FDA that came into power . They ruled Rife 's work did not fall under their now established guidelines for medical practice , and with the government to back them up , it was the end for his discovery .",0

"I need advice on how to start a grassroots campaign to get a masonry ordinance passed in my community. ? we have builders/ developers coming into our twon and throwing up homes with a lick of brick that will not have much durability that brick homes have . The will also bring down the property values of the homes in the surrounding neighborhoods . HELP ! Find out what city council and the mayor are doing about this situation , call them . If they 're not doing anything then organize community members , call a town meeting to speak about yours and others concerns of the buildings going up . Get a petition of the parties who wish to be involved or are just in support of your views . On the petition , ask for phone numbers and or emails or even addresses in case you need to raise funds to support your concerns . Seek out a Political Analyist or lobbyist to represent your concerns , this part might take money . If you are a small/medium sized town then just take your petition to the mayor or city council members to address the situation and pass laws accordingly . If you feel the mayor and council are not doing a good enough job , organize the members of the community to organize a protest at the next city meeting.For further inquiries and questions email me atwatty_ofthe_wattykins @ yahoo.com",0

"why was the square deal so important ? During the 1904 campaign , Roosevelt called his actions in the coal miners ' strike a `` square deal '' for both labor and capital , a term that stuck to his administration . Roosevelt was not the first president to take a stand for labor , but he was the first to bring opposing sides in a labor dispute to the White House to settle it . He was the first to threaten to seize a major industry , and he was the first to appoint a commission whose decision both sides agreed to accept . `` Let the watchwords of all our people be the old familiar watchwords of honesty , decency , fair-dealing , and commonsense . '' ... `` We must treat each man on his worth and merits as a man . We must see that each is given a square deal , because he is entitled to no more and should receive no less . '' ... `` The welfare of each of us is dependent fundamentally upon the welfare of all of us . '' —Roosevelt , New York State Fair , Syracuse , New York , September 7 , 1903 . The idea behind the Square Deal was to be fair to every citizen in the United States . To create this fairness , corporations and the average citizen had to be equal . To achieve this equality , President Roosevelt created a series of laws and programs aimed at rebalancing the balance of power between labor , consumer , and safety interests against business , manufacturers and profit.To ensure market competition , President Roosevelt built into the Square Deal program the concepts that monopolies were wrong and that business should not cut corners to the point where public health is jeopordized . When consumer buying power has no means to induce change via market competition , chances are the corporation would cut costs or corners to achieve a higher profit via deceptive practices , poor quality control , or polluting methods , at the expense of the consumers health or lives.So a square deal had to be instituted to ensure that business cost cutting measures have a limit . To achieve this goal , extreme cost cutting measures , wanton corruption and instability had to be brought under contol . Railroads were no longer allowed to give rebates or kickbacks to favored companies . Meat had to be processed safely with proper santitation , and people were allowed to breathe the fresh air of national parks . Foods and drugs could no longer be mislabeled , nor could consumers be delierately misled to make a profit . Businesses were forced to accept the additional cost of these reforms as a part of the their cost of doing business .",0

"does putting a minor on a credit account as an authorized user help them establish credit ? i thought that minor could not establish credit under any circumstances and that authorized users are simply that-authorized . they simply have permission to use the account and they have no responsibility . it will merely show as on the bureau once they are of age as they are an authorized user - and should not affect the bureau one way or the other . Yes it does ! Its a great way to help young people establish credit . My parents did it for me , and my 3 yr old already has a platinum . This is also a good way to help people with not so good credit to make it better . Still probably a good idea to be the one who physically has the credit card , until the minor is mature and responsible enough.Keep in mind that its a double edged sword , the authorized user of the account can also harm anyone whos on the account , such as if they have poor late payments or declare bankruptcy that can affect the minor with bad credit as well .",0

"im 22 yr old , doin grduation unable 2 ocncentrate on studies , much intrsted 2 knw abt sex , wats my problm ? sol pl i have zeal of studying more n wanted to b a good person for my family.i used to b first at my school and high school but now in my college im very poor studentnow if i found any sex scenes or related 2 that im much intrseted to see themusually iget headache alot in a daydo u think i ahve any physical or mental problem ? please suggest A psychological problem . That is why you are more likely to have headaches . Some headaches are n't physical but rather psycho - somatic . It has been found in psychology , that if you feel stressed about something , or you feel guily about an emotion you should n't experience , it might easier be translated into physical terms , such as headaches , neckaches , etc.Plus , if want to know about sex , I assume you have n't experienced it much before . That is a kind of imbalance that may affect people differently.The key to solving both your study problems , and your sex curiosity appears to be simple , relaxation . One question you should ask yourself , how often do you let yourself go , relax . Some people find it to be the greatest aspect of sexual satisfaction , a kind of relief , feellings of floatiness , etc . Maybe unconsciously your body knows what you want , more even than you do , and prods you in that direction , of completely giving in to relaxation.But that is just an opinion , your medical health provider might know more.Hope that helps .",0

"What is Islam and why is Islam ? What is Islam ? Islam is not a new religion , but the same truth that God revealed through all His prophets to every people . For a fifth of the world 's population , Islam is both a religion and a complete way of life . Muslims follow a religion of peace , mercy , and forgiveness , and the majority have nothing to do with the extremely grave events which have come to be associated with their faith.Who are the Muslims ? One billion people from a vast range of races , nationalities and cultures across the globe - from the southern Philippines to Nigeria - are united by their common Islamic faith . About 18 % live in the Arab world ; the world 's largest Muslim community is in Indonesia ; substantial parts of Asia and most of Africa are Muslim , while significant minorities are to be found in the Soviet Union , China , North and South America , and Europe.What do Muslims believe ? Muslims believe in One , Unique , Incomparable God ; in the Angels created by Him ; in the prophets through whom His revelations were brought to mankind ; in the Day of Judgement and individual accountability for actions ; in God 's complete authority over human destiny and in life after death . Muslims believe in a chain of prophets starting with Adam and including Noah , Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob , Joseph , Job , Moses , Aaron , David , Solomon , Elias , Jonah , John the Baptist , and Jesus , peace be upon them . But God 's final message to man , a reconfirmation of the eternal message and a summing-up of all that has gone before was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through Gabriel.What does 'Islam ' mean ? The Arabic word 'Islam ' simply means 'submission ' , and derives from a word meaning 'peace ' . In a religious context it means complete submission to the will of God . 'Mohammedanism ' is thus a misnomer because it suggests that Muslims worship Muhammad rather than God . 'Allah ' is the Arabic name for God , which is used by Arab Muslims and Christians alike .",0

"What is nesidioblastomia ? It 's disease of some kind , but I am not sure what it is . nesidioblastosis Nesidioblastosis is a controversial medical term for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia attributed to an abnormal microscopic appearance of pancreatic islet development . The term was coined in the first half of the 20th century . The abnormal histologic aspects of the tissue included the presence of islet cell enlargement , islet cell dysplasia , beta cells budding from ductal epithelium , and islets in apposition to ducts.By the 1970s , nesidioblastosis was primarily used to describe the pancreatic dysfunction associated with persistent congenital hyperinsulinism and in most cases from the 1970s until the 1970s , it was used as a synonym for what we now refer to as congenital hyperinsulinism.The term fell into disfavor after it was recognized in the late 1980s that the characteristic tissue features were sometimes seen in pancreatic tissue from normal infants and even adults , and is not consistently associated with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia . Most congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by different mechanisms than excessive proliferation of beta cells in a fetal pattern.A small number of case reports have purported to describe nesidioblastosis in adults",0

"What states have no law requiring breaks for workers ? What states , other than Virginia , have no law requiring employers to give rest or meal breaks in an eight-hour workday ? Few states require lunch or rest breaks , if any . I know that for most employees over the age of 18 in even more politically liberal states like New Jersey do not require rest breaks . Of course , many states regulate such for minors , but few for workers over the age of 18.I 've included a link to a Department of Labor chart that gives requirements for each state on meal breaks . It 's a pretty short list : California , Colorado , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Kentucky , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Nebraska , Nevada , New Hampshire , New York , North Dakota , Oregon , Rhode Island , Tennessee , Washington , and West Virginia.For rest breaks , the list shrinks to California , Colorad , Kentucky , Minnesota , Nevada , Oregon , and Washington.Perhaps few regulate is because most employers voluntarily give rest breaks to employees to make work more bearable . Perhaps few regulate because unions , often providing the strongest labor law components in states , do n't really care if non-unionized labor is forced to receive breaks , but really works hard to ensure that its own members are protected through contract agreements and bargaining . Regardless , I hope this information helps .",0

There comes a time when a country ca n't handle the incoming flow of illegals and must take action to be able to provide for those who were legally born inside the U.S.A . This has nothing to de with racisim as some people want to label it . Govt will be hugely benifited from this .",0

Democratic GAIN , Democracy for America , 21st Century Dems , EMILY 's List , etc . Something credible . Start with a local or state rep. campaign .

If you make even $ 2000/month I 'd be shocked and only federal campaigns tend to have health insurance.And do n't knock the volunteer thing - it worked for me .",0

"do u think that lies saves u from bein ur self ? I do n't think I would use the word 'saves ' . I 'll ignore your grammar and spelling and whatnot and try to answer what I think you might be asking.To say that lies 'save ' you from being yourself implies that you do n't like who you are and that you think that the fabrications are better than reality . In fact , it 's the opposite . Lies , if you tell them often , do separate you from who you really are in that they are false , and provide the one you 're lying to with a false impression of you . They tend to amalgamate until you 're boxed in by your own stories . They start to add up and keeping them all straight is difficult , and there are almost always discrepancies . If you lie too much , it can make people hate you for deceiving them . If there 's something you do n't like about your life , so much as to lie about it , then I would suggest changing who you are instead . Fix it , and then you can be honest with everyone , yourself included.However , if you must lie , I would stay as absolutely close to the truth as possible . It makes them that much more believable .",0

"when was asthma first discovered ? The word asthma is derived from the Greek aazein , meaning “ sharp breath. ” The word first appears in Homer 's Iliad ; [ 2 ] Hippocrates was the first to use it in reference to the medical condition . Hippocrates thought that the spasms associated with asthma were more likely to occur in tailors , anglers , and metalworkers . Six centuries later , Galen wrote much about asthma , noting that it was caused by partial or complete bronchial obstruction . Moses Maimonides , an influential medieval rabbi , philosopher , and physician , wrote a treatise on asthma , describing its prevention , diagnosis , and treatment . [ 3 ] In the 17th century , Bernardino Ramazzini noted a connection between asthma and organic dust . The use of bronchodilators started in 1901 , but it was not until the 1960s that the inflammatory component of asthma was recognized , and anti-inflammatory medications were added to the regimen . `` It was Hippocrates ( 460-357 BC ) , the Greek physician , who first described asthma and its resulting 'spasms ' . Galen ( 130-201 BC ) , a Greco-Roman doctor , discovered that asthma was due to bronchial obstruction . He treated it with owl 's blood in wine . `` Italian physician Bernardino Ramazzini described a link between his patient 's asthma and their jobs as far back as the early 1900s . `` Until the late 1800s , the most popular method of delivering asthma medication into the lungs was smoke . `` In 1864 , Dr.Henry Hyde Salter identified animal dander as an asthma trigger . `` In 1901 , a Japanese scientist , Jokici Takamine , purifies adrenaline , found in the suprarenal glands of sheep ( discovered in 1898 ) and develops the first effective bronchodilator . `` In the 1960s , asthma researchers discovered that asthma is an inflammatory disease , not just constriction of the airways , and that asthma sufferers have a sensitive immune system which reacts to airborne allergens . The first inhaled anti-inflammatory medication is born . `` In 1972 , inhaled corticosteroids hit the market . `` - Fraser Health",0

Many patients who complain of pain at rest , have a history of having worse pain at night while in bed sleeping , with relief from `` dangling their feet from the side of the bed '' . Before you decide to do anything , see your physician if you have not already done so . There are other disease proceses that may mimic peripheral artery occlusive disease . If it is arterial disease he will be able to better answer your questions , after a good examination .

"What made you interested in web accessibility ? As with CSS , my first real contact with accessibility came with my job at Salford . Although I was peripherally aware of the concept , and had previously heard mentions of the WCAG ( Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ) , it was never something I thought I needed to concern myself with . However , researching some of the legal requirements involving educational websites in the UK , I inevitably came across SENDA ( Special Educational Needs and Disabilities Act ) and the wider DDA ( Disabilities Discrimination Act ) . To summarise very broadly , the DDA demands , among other things , that the provision of goods and services should be ( within reason ) accessible to anybody . In its initial state , the DDA did only cover businesses and government bodies , making a special exception for educational establishments . SENDA , which effectively became part IV of the DDA , removed this special status , bringing education back under the general provisions of the main DDA . Although the Act itself does not directly mention web sites , the 'Code of Practice - Rights of Access Goods , Facilities , Services and premises ' does , and it is understood that therefore all government , education and business sites need to make 'reasonable adjustments ' to ensure a basic level of accessibility . So , having started my position as web editor at the University of Salford and realising the legal requirement imposed by SENDA/DDA , I began delving deeper into the subject of accessibility . What I found was that , even among 'seasoned ' web managers in the UK education sector and beyond , there was a lot of ignorance and confusion - coupled with misinformed management concerned with 'Bobby validation ' as the be all and end all . This sorry state of affairs , combined with the fact that , deep down , I feel that accessibility is simply the ethically/morally right thing to do , led me to explore this subject further . I find it fascinating that even though in recent years more and more sites , books and even conferences have been devoted to accessibility , there are still many grey areas once you move beyond the basics , where even experts can furiously disagree . It 's not all cut and dry , and in many instances one has to take a pragmatic approach , weighing up how things should be done ( according to things like W3C specifications or even common sense ) against how they work in practice ( in light of flaky browser or assistive technology support , for instance ) .",0
"Could you imagine if it was Andrea Yates husband that killed his 5 children ... . ? instead of Mrs. Yates ? I wonder if there would be as much compassion as they are showing for this woman ? ? This is the sick reality of the world we live in ... everyone is all for abortion but opposes the death penalty ... It is so wrong to kill someone who has brutaly taken the life of someone else , but it is perfectly acceptable to kill an innocent unborn baby ... The horrible tradgedy is not that 5 beautiful innocent children lost their lives at their mothers hand , but that this woman was sitting in prison having to live with her actions and blaming it on depression ... .Quite frankly , they should have drown her in a bath tub as she did to her innocent children ...

"Why do n't people know when their breath smells badly ? The olfactory bulb is the sense of smell . It is an accessory nerve sense . It adapts quite readily .

These sensory bulbs adapt and you can no longer notice it , another person walks up and notices quite readily .",0

You stop seeing the advantage in being gone , in wanting to see others punished for not treating you as you think they should.And you start treating yourself as though you were someone special , someone that you really , really care about . You give them ( you ) the best of whatever you have - the best attention , the best potato chip out of the bag , the nicest clothes in your closet . You start telling yourself that you are someone special . Write notes and letters and stories about how good you are , and all the things you want to have and do and all the opportunities that are out there for you.And every day , you look in the mirror and say `` This is going to be a great day . '' Even if you do n't believe it , you say it . And you stop during the day and `` smell the roses . '' You find the things you like to do and you do them - because you are special and you deserve it.If you 're looking to punish people , this will annoy them much more , because you 'll have found a joy in life that they do n't have .

But look what it reads in the book of Job ... `` God hangs the earth on nothing . '' And in Isaiah it reads , `` It is God who sits above the circle of the earth . '' That word `` circle '' in Hebrew is ball or sphere . So if people poopoo the Bible with their lofty scientific thinking , they have probably not even read the Bible to check . I know scientists who have read the Bible , and are amazed at how accurate it is.We know that all matter is made up of atoms and electrons . I nor any scientist has ever seen an electron . But because of scientific study , we know they exist . The Bible reads in Hebrews 11:3 ...

"how did the `` southern accent '' or drawl come to be ? I 've included a link to a good article on this topic - good reading .

'' [ 1 ] ) . These immigrants brought with them a very distinct style of English speaking , which was then combined with the African languages spoken by the African Americans who were at this time enslaved in the South . Over time this cultural and linguistic diversity combined with the South 's rural isolation , and longtime use and familiarity with the King James Version of the Bible in religious life , to produce a unique American dialect .",0

"Who decides what is politically correct ? Support your answer please . Politically correct is a term that I think refers to respect for minorities . It 's basically a way of speaking that attempts to respect others by adopting the same language they use when referring to themselves , or the issues that are of most importance to them . It is a reflection of our national values of equality and equal rights.Because of the nature of opression , majority groups such as Men , Christians and Whites are usually much less affected by slurs , racism , etc , because they are not living with the legacy of discrimination and opression in the recent past.To answer the question , I would say that the minorities themselves would be the ones who decide what is and is not disrespectful , racist , or politically correct from their perspective.For example , many black people prefer to be called `` African Americans '' rather than black or negro or other such words . Some of those worlds have been used throughout our history and are strongly connected with opression and discrimination . Knowing this , we can choose to respect those wishes and adopt that speech , or we can reject it outright.Asian-Americans may feel that being called `` oriental '' is offensive to them , as the word has it has taken on a negative historical connotation , in books and spoken words throuought the years.Women might find it offensive to be called `` the little lady '' or `` girls '' , as this may harken back to a time when people thought of women as inferior to men or needing of male guidance , so they prefer to be called women.Basically I think that political correctness is a choice that you make to respect or disrespect minorities when you are discussing issues of race or gender in public .",0

"what is the main cause why computer gets a virus ? As the other responders suggest , people do n't practice safe computing .

I assure you , this is a false sense of security . Do not trust the hardware or software to do the whole job for you.I believe the primary reason why computers get a virus is a lack of common sense . To wit ... - Be skeptical of anything you receive in e-mail that was not solicited , especially if it has an attachment.- Think twice before downloading that freeware.- Avoid Kazaa and the like.- Do review website certificates to satisfy yourself that the site you 're heading for is really the site you wanted to go to.- Make sure you download and install every security patch your OS vendor provides . You should manually review your vendor at least weekly ... even if you have an automatic update feature.A few minutes spent on satisfying yourself that you 've done everything you can do will provide you with peace of mind .",0

"How is NAMASTE pronounced ? I read about it when sukhjiwansekhon asked what it meant and I really like the word and would like to use it . NAMASTE IS A HINDI WORD ( LANGUAGE USED IN HINDI ) '' Namaste '' is sometimes used in the context of practicing Yoga as a greeting or goodbye , generally taken as an expression of good will . Namaste is sometimes mis-interpreted as a greeting associated with Yoga only , but it is much more widely used than that in South Asia , particularly in greeting elders . Moreover , it is used throughout Asia , especially in the context of Buddhism or Buddhist cultures , even though it is known by different names in some languages.Namaste is a Hindi word , and hence has widespread use in North India where Hindi and its dialects are the languages spoken . Gassho is the term used in Japanese contexts for the hand-gesture , and for the wider bowing , as a whole . In Thailand , the guesture is known as wai ( pronounced `` why '' with a rising tone ) .In some parts of India ( for example , Punjabi-speaking areas ) , Namaste is used only to greet Hindus .

"Is soul eternal ? why / how ? The `` soul '' is definitely NOT eternal . Look back in Genesis 2:7 at the creation of Adam . Note closely what it said : `` ... .and he became a living soul .

"What is your opinion of scientific medicine ... ? Do you think doctors , drug companies , etc . have ( in general ) our best interest in mind ? Do you think we have become a society too dependent on pills ? Do you think there is a real , significant benefit to using herbs and natural `` cures '' and preventatives as opposed to either using `` medicine '' or not using anything ? How do you deal with the people who think you are a quack for believing in natural remedies ? That 's quite a bit to sort through . I 'll do my best.I believe that individual doctors almost always have the best interests of their patients in mind . Medicine as a whole , however , is far more interested in the bottom line . This applies especially to the drug companies . From what I understand certain diseases do n't have enough people suffering from them to make it profitable to research treatments for them . Or , if the research has been done , there is not enough profit in manufacturing drugs to treat these people . I 've even read that there are boutique chemists who make , by hand , very small runs of certain drugs at no profit to themselves , simply to help out.As far as I 'm concerned , this is inexcusable . Do I have a solution ? No . Are alternative treatments viable ? I 'm sure that sometimes they are and sometimes they are not . Again , the problem comes down to making a buck . People who are suffering are , unfortunately , easy marks and snake-oil-salesmen have known this since the dawn of civilization.The problem becomes sorting the con-men from the well-meaning , but dangerously untrained , from the people with actual remedies . This is very difficult and requires a tremendous amount of work on the part of people who often lack the time and energy to do the necessary legwork because they are sick.Coretta Scott King died seeking medical help from a quack . It is awful that she suffered such an undignified end , but as long as there are people to be taken advantage of , others will do their best to part them from their money . Obviously not all alternative treatments are quackery , but they often get lumped together because of the actions of a few ( many , actually ) bad apples . I would suggest that the alternative-therapy industry engage in harsher self-policing as a way to remove the undeserved black-mark.As for you responding to questions which are specifically targeted at individuals , I welcome this . The thing that I like most about Yahoo Answers is that it is a place that encourages the free exchange of ideas between anybody . I do n't think that anyone can , or should , get upset when a targeted question receives several answers . That 's the best thing about this place . So , feel free to throw your two cents in anytime . I really appreciate your response about Bush and Christians . I 'd be very curious to hear what this man , who presumes to speak for all Christian Americans would have to say about that . Thanks for your input .",0

"Have you seen Munich ? How was it ? are you referring to the city or the movie ? since your question 's in the movie category , i assume this is about the movie ? the one starring eric bana ? This movie attempts to illuminate both sides of Israel 's conflict . While the focus is on Israeli actions and choices , Palestinian and Arab motivations are present throughout the work . For me , Speilberg 's treatment of both sides was an attempt at balance . Neither side is commended or exaulted for their behavior . Instead , the film attempts to generally question the nature of their decisions and acts . If this film does make any stance on Israel and Palestine , it makes a general condemnation of the violence on both sides . Speilberg goes through great lengths to show the cycle of violence - lamenting the perpetual loss of life in violent conflict.The film 's conclusion extends Speilberg 's effort to question violence and its role in human affairs . The protagonist chooses against returning home - he lives in exile . The cycle of violence has taken a toll on him . I 'm unclear in deciding whether the protagonist approves or condemns of his own choices . But I do believe that he realizes that violence is not a future solution . I think that this was a geniune attempt at thoughtful reflection of the consequences of violent conflict . For a mainstream movie , this had unusual depth . I felt that there was an honest attempt to depict both sides as human beings - with rational , legitmate values and motivations . I would encourage anyone to see this film . Audiences should try to analyze both the film 's perspective and their our own beliefs on the real world content behind the work . Any film that can spark people to pose these serious questions deserves attention .",0

"what is web engineering and what are its types ? Web engineering deals with design , development and implementation of large-scale Web applications . In particular , it focuses on the methodologies , techniques and tools that are the foundation of complex Web application development and which support their design , development , evolution , and evaluation . It is a relatively a new discipline.Web application development has certain characteristics that make it different from traditional software , information system , or computer application development.Web engineering is multidisciplinary and encompasses contributions from diverse areas : systems analysis and design , software engineering , hypermedia/hypertext engineering , requirements engineering , human-computer interaction , user interface , information engineering , information indexing and retrieval , testing , modelling and simulation , project management , and graphic design and presentation.Web engineering is not a clone or not a subset of software engineering , although both involve programming and software development . While Web Engineering uses software engineering principles , it encompasses new approaches , methodologies , tools , techniques , and guidelines to meet the unique requirements of Web-based.Main topics of Web engineering include , but are not limited to , the following areas : * Business Processes for Applications on the Web * CASE Tools for Web Applications * Code Generation for Web Applications * Collaborative Web Development * Conceptual Modelling of Web Applications ( aka . Web modeling ) * Data Models for Web Information Systems * Development Process and Process Improvement of Web Applications * Empirical Web Engineering * Integrated Web Application Development Environments * Multimedia Authoring Tools and Software * Performance of Web-based Applications * Personalisation and Adaptation of Web Applications * Process Modelling of Web Applications * Prototyping Methods and Tools * Quality Control and Testing * Requirements Engineering for Web Applications * Semantic Web Applications * Software Factories for/on the Web * Testing Automation , Methods and Tools for Web Applications * Ubiquitous and Mobile Web Applications * UML and the Web * Usability of Web Applications * Web Accessibility * Web Design Methods * Web Engineering Education * Web Interface Design * Web Metrics , Cost Estimation , and Measurement * Web Project Management and Risk Management * Web Services Development and Deployment",0

"Has anyone lived in India ? What was your experience ? I want to visit but India is so vast and has so many appealing areas , that I would n't know where to begin ? Any advice ? it depends on what you want to do and see . I would n't say that I lived there , but I was there for 5 months . The longest period of time i was in one place was 2 months . Honestly i do n't even know where to begin describing what it was like . it was without a doubt a very positive , but sometimes stressful , experience . I think that everybody should travel to india at least once . I traveled only in the north , so that is the only area i can really give advice on . For the south i heard that Kerala , Hampi , and Pondicherry were the places to see , but I could n't tell you if that is true . To start with let me say that traveling in india is not as daunting as it seems . i started out with a program , but stayed on after its end when i realized that i would be able to get around on my own . unless you have about a year , you will probably not see everything , so do n't worry about seeing everything . You can probably get by just fine with only english , but it never hurts to know a little hindi or whatever the local language is , if only to see the shock on people 's faces . lol . The cost is very cheap , you can easily get by on $ 10 a day ( room , board , insurance , food , and maybe transportation ) . Sanitation is a big problem over there ( to us ! ) , but if you just use common sense you will be fine . it is a very safe country for the most part , but if you are a lone female you do need to exercise some caution . nearly every female traveller i came across had at least one complaint of minor harassment.the places that i saw that i really liked and/or you have to see are in the north : ladakh , dharamsala , manali , kashmir are all in the mountains and are much more relaxed than the cities in the central plains , although kashmir is not so safe in rajasthan : jodhpur without a doubt , jaipur is more popular with tourists but i did n't like it as muchin central india : agra of course , orchha ( near jhansi ) , varanasi ( stressful , but worth it for the sights and culture shock ) , khajuraho ( although they really go after tourists here ) , and delhi of course ( but it can be a bit stressful if you stay there too long ) in the east : darjeeling is a good place to chill , and i heard sikkim is amazingthe best advice i have , if you have n't already done it , is to get a guidebook ( i used lonely planet ) now and start looking at pics and reading about the places . i really hope that you get as much out of it as i did.if you do have any other specific questions , you can email me if you want : jeff32224 @ yahoo.comgood luck !",0

"was there a man named john appleseed ... ..and did he start out in illonoise ? Johnny Appleseed in real life was one John Chapman , born on September 26,1774 near Leominster , Massachusetts . Little is known of his early life , but he apparently received a good education which helped him in his later years . By the time he was 25 years old , he had become a nursery man and had planted apple trees in the western portions of New York and Pennsylvania . Some of the orchards in those areas were said to have originated with his apple trees.When the rich and fertile lands lying south of the Great Lakes and west of the Ohio river were opened for settlement in the early 1800 's , John Chapman was among the very first to explore the new territory . This was the Northwest Territory from which the states of Ohio , Michigan , Indiana , and Illinois were later formed . For nearly half a century Johnny Appleseed roamed his territory . When settlers arrived , they found John Chapman 's young apple trees ready for sale . In the years that followed , he became known as the Apple Tree Man , or Johnny Appleseed.His manner of operation was simple . He went into the wildreness with a bag of apple seeds on his back until he found a likely spot for planting . There he would clear the land by chopping out weeds and brush by hand . Then he planted his apple seeds in neat rows and built a brush fence around the area to keep out straying animals . His nurseries varied in size . Some were only an acre or so , others covered many acres.He did all of the work himself , living alone for weeks at a time with only the Indians and wild animals for companionship . He never carried a gun or weapon of any kind . He was a deeply religious man who lived by the Golden Rule and had no fear of man or beast . Indians accepted him as a friend , and he is reputed to have talked at times to the wild animals who watched him as he worked in his nurseries . Undoubtedly , they sensed his kind and gentle nature . Once , it is reported , he was caught in a snow storm and crept into a hollow fallen tree for shelter . He found it occupied by a hibernating bear and her cubs , but spent the night there nonetheless . There is no report , however , of how much space he kept between them and himself.John Chapman was a practical businessman as well as a sincere Christian . Somewhere , somehow , he had caught a vision of the winderness blossoming with apple trees , orchard after orchard of carefully nurtured trees , whose fragrant blossoms gave promise of a fruitful harvest for the settlers . Willingly he endured the hardships of his wilderness life as he worked to make his dream come true . His sturdy young trees lightened the hearts and lifted the spirits of many settlers , for there is a suggestion of a permanent and loving home when one plants fruit trees around a cabin.He sold his trees for a few pennies each , accepting any of the coins current on the frontier . Some had no cash , and from those he accepted a simple promise to pay at a later date . Few failed to keep their word . He sometimes accepted payment in used clothing.As he was a small man , his bartered clothing usually fit him poorly . This led to some of the humorous descriptions of his appearance in those early years . Like many of the settlers , he went barefooted a great deal because shoes were hard to come by and seldom fit his tough gnarled feet . As he ate no meat , he carried a stewpot or kettle with him . In this he could gather nuts or berries in season , carry water , get milk from a settler 's cow , boil potatoes , or drop a handful of coarse-ground meal into the boiling water to make an unpalatable but nourishing meal . He has been pictured wearing such a pot on his head , but more likely he kept it tied to his pack rather than let it bounce on his head.He preferred to walk , carrying his precious apple seeds and the simplest of camping gear on his back . He also used a boat , canoe , or raft to transfer larger loads of seeds along the many waterways . Customarily , he obtained his apple seeds every fall . At first , he",0

I 'm a single parent of five children.4 of which live with me , and one who lives across the way.Thier ages range from 12-20.I have 1 year clean and extremely overwhelmed.I attend college,5x a week.9-4pm.I 'm not good with consistency and am having trouble teaching my children how important it is to be responsible.Especailly for themselves.It 's very hard for me to concetrate on clearing the wreckage from my past when I 'm bouncing around from School , NA support groups , Probation , Court , Dr.appt. , Psycologist.I feel like I 'm drowning and my kids are watching me go under.If you would be so kind to give me some feedback , I would feel like someone is on my side.Thanks for listening . First , let me congratulate you ond keeping clean for so long , that 's a hard task after dependence when your life is so overwhelming to you . Good job ! Second , let me commend you on keeping up to this point with the wreckage that is the past and getting your education going while living with teenagers ! Not an easy or enviable task . You should be very proud of yourself for coming this far and getting things on the right track . As hard as it may be your are doing great things for yourself and your children and both you and your kids should be very proud . Its tough for anyone to teach their children to be responsible , even tough to maintain responsibility ourselves , and we are the best lesson our kids have . It sounds like the kids are all old enough to helping out around the house . I think good hard work is one of the greatest things my father ever did for me growing up . They need to be chipping in and helping you get things moving with more ease than it is now . Set some goals/requirements , place some rewards for success to help motivate them ( often rewards are every bit as good as punishment and will foster a better relationship without bitterness ) . For yourself , stay on top of your legal responsibilities , get it done with and move on ... what a weight to be lifted when you can trully leave it behind you . Keep clean by whatever means necessary and feel damn good for doing it ! Its far too easy to fall back into a bad routine when stress is high . Know in your heart that there is a light at the end , and try to relax when you can in the hectic pace . Things will get better.Good Luck to you and the fam ... .",0

"do i have to send thank you notes for christmas ? The rule is ... if the giver is in a different house from you , you NEED to send one . Do n't just send a blank one though ! Here is a fabulous guide on what to say : There is a six-point formula to the proper thank-you : Learn it , know it , memorize it – and it will never fail you.1 . Greet the Giver Dear Aunt Sally , That ’ s the easy part , but you ’ d be surprised how many people forget it . Dale Carnegie taught us people love to hear their own names and Direct Marketing is sure we also love to read them in ink . That ’ s right , ink . Blue-black is always the number-one choice , but black will suffice in a pinch . Don ’ t let a whimsical marker color be the most stunning part of your note : instead let the words sing without the amplification of rainbow hues . Even if your handwriting is poor , you must still hand-write your notes . Do not type them or , worse , use a word processor . No excuses.2 . Express Your Gratitude Thank you so much for the slippers.This first paragraph seems like it would be the easiest , but it is actually the most complicated . Beware the just writing trap . You are not ‘ just writing to say ’ as in I am just writing to say ; that ’ s stating the obvious . If the giver is reading , clearly you have already written . Therefore use the present-perfect tense , which essentially means write as if whatever you say is happening in the moment.Also – and this is important – never directly mention money . ‘ Thank you for the hundred bucks ’ could instead be ‘ Thank you for your generosity. ’ All cash denominations become ‘ your generosity ’ or ‘ your kindness. ’ If you feel the giver overspent , the farthest you can go is appreciated : ‘ Your generosity is appreciated , ’ or ‘ It is such an extravagant gift – your kindness is appreciated. ’ If you ’ re writing to thank someone for an intangible ( such as them putting you up at their place while you were in town for the weekend ) , first define what the intangible thing is , and then make the gift sound as attractive as possible . In other words , don ’ t say : ‘ Thanks for letting us crash at your place. ’ Instead say : ‘ Thank you for your hospitality. ’ Don ’ t worry if it sounds too simple ; the point of writing the note is to create a simple expression of a heartfelt sentiment.3 . Discuss Use It gets very chilly here in the winter , so they will get a lot of use when winter comes.Say something nice about the item and how you will use it . Let ’ s say it ’ s something you actually love and use incessantly – then say so : ‘ Ever since I got the slippers I have only taken them off to shower and go to work . I ’ d wear them to the office if I thought I could get away with it. ’ But don ’ t lie , even though some etiquette books may tell you it ’ s okay . After all , there ’ s always a truth that can be extracted . Let ’ s say you hate the slippers . How to say thanks ? Find the one thing about them that ’ s nice and discuss it – but don ’ t get carried away . ‘ They are such a lovely shade of blue ’ works , and is more honest than ‘ These slippers make my heart sing like a choir of angels , ’ which is overkill . If it was a gesture , like letting you stay at their place , you can follow the lines of ‘ It ’ s so nice to make a personal connection while traveling . I really appreciated my time with your family. ’ If the gift was cash , allude to how you will use the money , but do not itemize your planned purchases line by line , instead simply say : ‘ It will be a great help when we purchase our new home/toaster/lava lamp/whatever. ’ You can get arty here , but not flowery . It ’ s a fine line . Small , realistic statements like ‘ I put the flowers on the kitchen table and they are still looking fresh and beautiful after a week , ’ or ‘ I don ’ t know which is more fun , actually using the Cuisinart , or reading recipes and thinking I could do that in the Cuisinart ! ’ Having fun is alright , so have at it.4 .

"How does the free market environment encourage the economic and socioeconomic goals sought by society ? Free markets economy is an addendum to the laws of nature . Water flows from high to low till equilized . There is no good or bad about it - it just is . The good is - lower parts can get water , the bad part is that water may cause attrition or floods along the way , or simply be wasted in the lower areas . But movement of resources from resource rich to rosurce poor countries/areas follows the same principle . Survival of the fittest is another way of looking at it . In the resourse hungry countries , people will do anything to survive , including accepting low paid jobs . In the resource rich countries , people are at a higher level of Maslow 's triangle , are more complacent and demanding of higher standards of living . This creates a cycle of abundance and deprivation in various areas of the world - thus a boom is always followed by a boom and vice versa.The overall socio-economic goals of a society include equality for all . Free markets are one way of redistributing wealth and adhering to the supply and demand principles . Culture of consumerism necessitates maximizing affordability - so production has to be at the lowest price . If the demand of the same job is high elsewhere , then thats where the jobs will go.Most issues associated with concept of free economy are detrimental to the wellbeing of vulnerable population . Patent issues cause hundreds of thousand deaths/suicides in India and Africa . It amplifies the divide between the rich and the poor . WHO , GATT , JAFAA and NAFTAA are weapons used to coerce governments of small countries . Instead of waging war and occupying countries , the US uses trade economics to control and occupy countries . So Free Trade has really become an intrument of war rather than the instrument of social justice that it was supposed to be.I guess the free economy is a concept - and just like any other concept it has its good and bad . Often the media portrays only one side of the issue - depending on where you live you get to hear one side of the story .",0

"what should I do ? I feel like all of my prayers are'nt getting through to God , I 've backslide alot lately and I 'm scared that God dosent accept me any more . It seems like every thing I do is wrong , and conviction jumps on me and makes me feel so down . I feel like I 'm a million miles away from God .

But we are also warned to be sober-minded ( Rom 12:3 ) . One of the most fearful verses I know that keeps me most sober is Matthew 7:21-23 : 21 “ Not everyone who says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter the kingdom of heaven , but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven . 22Many will say to me on that day , ‘ Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy in your name , and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles ? ’ 23Then I will tell them plainly , ‘ I never knew you . Away from me , you evildoers ! ’ You can not DO anything to please God . He is pleased with perfection . Jesus is perfection , and died for your sins in your place . Do good because he loves you , not to pay your way back `` in '' . Grace is a gift not deserved . See Romans 7 : 14-20.Love the Lord your God with Everything-Trust in Him .

You ’ ll freefall from generally above 10,000 ’ down to between 5,000 ’ , and 6,000 ’ or approximately 30 seconds ( one mile at 120 mph ) . Round canopies are a thing of the past ; you ’ ll descend under a high performance rectangular wing ( ram air canopy ) to a soft landing . Cost generally ranges from the $ 170 range in Kansas , to $ 230 or so on the east or west coast.Solo , of which there are two forms being the old standard Static Line training method , and Accelerated Freefall ( AFF ) . For Static line you ’ ll have a 4 to 6 hour ground school , then you ’ ll jump from 4,000 ’ and your main parachute will start deployment as you fall away from the airplane . The “ accelerated ” in refers to the fact that you ’ ll freefall with a solo rig ( as opposed to tandem ) on your first jump . The ground training generally runs a couple of hours longer than the Static Line training , but you ’ ll exit from again above 10 ’ 000 ’ with two AFF instructors physically holding onto you for the freefall portion of your skydive . With both methods , once you ’ re under an open canopy , you ’ ll have assistance from the ground.There are methods which incorporate , and mix the methods . With “ Tandem Progressing ” you ’ ll be required to do a minimum of 3 tandem skydives , and then you ’ ll move into the AFF progression . The United States Parachute Association is the non government member association for skydiving in the US . You ’ re required to complete 25 freefalls to qualify for your first USPA license.Modern skydiving is very safe compared to its roots in the early days . Every skydiver is required to jump with two canopies ; a main and reserve . The main canopy malfunction rate is 1 in 1,000 +/- , and is generally related to the fact that they are cutting edge , high performance . The malfunction rate for reserves is in the range of wining the lottery . In the United States there are generally 20 to 30 skydiving fatalities ( of one million plus jumps ) , well in excess of 99 % of these fatalities are attributed to pilot error.MartinAC DZ",0

"What 's the best ( K-12 or college ) class you ever took , and what made the experience great ? I 'm not a teacher myself , simply curious . My favorite class was a college class called The Short Fiction of Franz Kafka . It was discussion based , 3 hours long , and once a week . It was amazing how much I learned in that format . First off ... ... .I am such a language/English/literature person . But in college I had to take a statistics class . I was scared to death because I just so do n't have a mathematical mind . I loved it ! The teacher was amazing ... ... and related to each of us on such a personal level . The hilarious part was that it was one of those huge lecture type classes with over 200 people . Yet , she had this way of making it seem like she was talking straight to you . We would all be working problems and laughing and poking fun at our silly mistakes instead of feeling like we were losers for screwing up . Her tests were monstrously hard , but I ended up with an `` A '' in the course . Shows you what amazing teaching skills mixed with personable skills can do for students . I loved this question ... ... I 'm so glad you asked it . I have n't thought of her in so long . I really should go find her and tell her thanks sometime !",0

The answer here is obvious . Satan is a Christian symbol of evil ( and most people here know a lot more about Christianity than Satanism ) , so they automatically assume they know what Satanism is . Do n't take it personally ( if you are a Satanist , that is ) , they just do n't know any better.Though I have to admit some confusion : why would anyone choose a symbol that to most people means something evil ? It 's bound to invite confusion and ridicule . I understand the overall reasoning , but surely another symbol would have sufficed , like the god Pan ?",0

"how do you remve genital warts ? thank you ? What are Condyloma ? Condylomata acuminata or genital warts are fleshy growths which appear in the genital area . They are caused by HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS ( HPV ) and are usually spread by sexual contact . Symptoms and Diagnosis . Genital warts first appear as small pink or red bumps on the vulva ( lips of the vagina ) , vagina , cervix , penis shaft , urinary opening or rectum . They are usually painless , but some people may have itching , burning or slight bleeding from these areas . The time between exposure to the virus and the appearance of warts is not known . It could be anywhere from several weeks to several years before symptoms occur . Because of this , it is had to tell when and where you were exposed to the virus . Sometimes vaginal infections and pregnancy can cause warts to grow and spread . One study showed that 20 % of women with genital warts also had a vaginal infection . Unless that infection is treated , the warts may not go away . Warts may spread up inside the vagina and on the cervix . They may also cause abnormal Pap smears . During pregnancy warts may be treated so they do not spread or grow larger . In men , warts may spread inside the penis causing problems when they urinate . The diagnosis of condylomata acuminata is usually made by a health care provider simply inspecting the genital area . Occasionally , they may want to remove a wart and send it to the lab for further tests . Because genital warts are a sexually transmitted disease other tests may be done for other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea , Chlamydia , syphilis , HIV and hepatitis . Treatment.Genital warts are frustrating for you to have and frustrating for doctors to treat . Some warts will disappear on their own . Others may come and go despite vigorous treatment . One of the most important things you can do is to KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENTS ! The treatment is easier when the warts are small and few in number . There is no one magic treatment for genital warts . Many methods may be tried depending on where , how large and how long the warts have been there . Certain chemicals may be applied to smaller warts on moist areas . The most common chemical used is called TRICHLOROACETIC ACID ( TCA ) . TCA is a clear , watery liquid that is painted on the warts . It causes a burning sensation as it dries . The warts will turn a whitish color , shrink and disappear . It will take weekly treatments for a number of weeks to get rid of the warts . Another chemical , PODOPHYLLIN , is a brown liquid that may also be used . It also causes a burning sensation as it dries . It must be washed off with soap and water 4 to 6 hours after it has been applied . In certain circumstances , a preparation of this medication may be applied by the patient at home . If TCA and PODOPHYLLIN do not work , the doctor may try freezing the wart with a treatment called CRYOTHERAPY , treating the affected area with topical 5FU CREAM , or performing laser surgery . Occasionally , INTERFERON injections are used if all other methods of treatment have failed . None of the treatments mentioned here are a guarantee that the warts will never come back . Once the wart virus ( HPV ) is in the skin , genital warts may occur again and again . This may require numerous visits to the doctor and many months of treatment . We know this can be very discouraging , but remember -- warts are easier to treat when they are small and few in number . KEEP THOSE APPOINTMENTS ! If the condyloma do not respond to treatment , your doctor may refer you to the Colposcopy Clinic . There your vulva or cervix will be examined through a special scope that magnifies the area . Tissue samples ( biopsies ) may be taken for further study . The doctors can then recommend further treatment options . PreventionThere are two ways to prevent getting warts : Use condoms during sex . Protect yourself . Celibacy - not having sex . If you have warts : Avoid sexual contact during treatment . If your warts are recurrent or you have a",0

Any help would be greatly appreciated . : - ) From my understanding , it sounds like you want to `` copy '' you install of windows XP onto another computer . This will not work for a few reasons . 1 ) The current WinXP installation is configured for the machine its on right now . If you transfer exactly that windows install it will not load . ( without some major hacks ) 2 ) It 's technically illegal to install one copy of windows xp on two machines.But on the other hand to transfer information between the two machines , the easiest solution is to pull the Hard drive from the 98 machine and stick it in the XP machine .

"Where can I learn all about the basics of credit cards ? i know almost nothing about them except that you use them to pay for things . i want to know first the basics , and then strategies to avoid having bad credit ( i dont have any credit yet ) . I 've been searching all over , but the websites i find are always using terms and acronyms that i 'm not sure i know the meaning of . can someone help me out ? I agree with VaTreasures - the best thing you can do when using a credit card is to discipline yourself to pay off your balance on time . If you get into a habit of not paying on time you start to acrue more and more interest fees ( I know all about it ) . Paying back on time will also avoid any missed payment penalties.Apply for a credit card with an interest free period , this will cut down on costs . Getting an interest free period is important.If you are unhappy with the idea of running a credit account , then I would recommend a prepaid card or direct debit card . Prepaid cards can be loaded with funds so you can not overspend , which keeps your finances in good shape . Debit cards withdraw funds from your bank account instantly when you make a purchase , again these do not require managing a credit account and help discipline your spending.More helpful tips from round the web :",0
"how is the president of the united nations elected ? I think you 're referring to the position of UN Secretary General . There is no position as `` President of the U.N. '' The United Nations Secretary-General is the head of the Secretariat , one of the principal divisions of the United Nations . The Secretary-General is appointed to a five year term . UN Secretaries-General usually serves two consecutive terms , but sometimes only one . The U.N. Secretary General is chosen in two steps : The Security Council nominates a candidate to the U.N. General Assembly , which must then approve the selection by majority vote . In practice , the power to select a new Secretary General rests with the Security Council , since the General Assembly has never rejected its nominee . A successful candidate must have the backing of nine of the Security Council 's 15 member states , including all five permanent members ( Britain , China , France , Russia , and the U.S. ) . As a result , the selection is subject to the veto of any of the five permanent members of the Security Council . S/he is not elected by the citizens in direct voting.By convention , the position rotates by geographic region . And as of now , there has not yet been a Secretary-General from North America or Oceania .",0

"What are the rules of the basketball game ? basketball , game played generally indoors by two opposing teams of five players each . Basketball was conceived in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith , a physical education instructor at the YMCA college in Springfield , Mass. , as a way to condition outdoor athletes during the winter months . His original list of 13 rules has undergone a century of revision , leading to faster pacing and greater athleticism . Today basketball is one of the most popular American sports and one the rest of the world has adopted.Basic RulesAt each end of the court—usually about 92 ft ( 28 m ) long and 50 ft ( 15 m ) wide—is a bottomless basket made of white cord net and suspended from a metal ring , 18 in . ( 46 cm ) in diameter , which is attached 10 ft ( 3.05 m ) above the floor ( usually hardwood ) to a backboard made of fiberglass , wood , or other material . Players may throw , dribble ( bounce ) , or shoot the basketball ( an inflated ball usually made of leather or rubber ) but may not run with it or kick it.Teams try to advance the ball and shoot it through one basket ( the ball must enter from above ) and to keep the opposition from scoring through the other . Each field goal , or basket , scores two points , or three points if shot from beyond a specified distance ( 21 ft/6 m in U.S. colleges , slightly longer in international and professional play ) . Teams must shoot the ball within a prescribed time limit ( 24 sec in the National Basketball Association ; 30 sec in international games and in most women 's play ; 45 sec in men 's collegiate play ) .Any player making illegal body contact with an opposing player is assessed a foul ; the opposing team may be given possession of the ball , or an opposing player awarded free throws at the basket from the foul line . Each made foul shot is worth one point . Players who exceed the foul limit ( usually five , but six in the NBA ) are disqualified from the game . International and collegiate basketball games have two 20-min halves , professionals play four 12-min quarters , and high schoolers play four 8-min quarters .",0

"Is cheerleading a sport ? And if you do n't belive so , why not ? It really does get unfair sometimes that people do n't believe cheerleading is a sport . Cheerleaders have this bad reputation , but really , we 're nothing like that . If only people just knew how hard we work , and how much pressure we have on us , then they would believe it 's a sport . We work our asses off ! It 's a sport ! Get used to it ! ! Please find Heather Jeffries , M.P.A opinion here : Most cheerleaders say “ YES ” while state and school officials say “ no. ” According to the National Federation of High School Athletic Associations , seventeen to twenty states of the United States consider cheerleading a sport . Why is the question , “ Is cheerleading a sport ? ” such a controversial issue to anyone not involved with the sport ? According to MSN Encarta , the definition of sport is an individual or group competitive activity involving physical exertion or skill , governed by rules , and sometimes engaged in professionally . Because cheerleading follows every aspect defined under the word sport , it is my belief that cheerleading should be defined as an actual sport.The word cheerleader no longer means a sideline of squads that exist solely to support other sporting teams . Cheer teams are teams in their own right . College and high school cheer teams competefor national titles just as football , basketball , baseball , etc . Cheerleaders are recruited for college scholarships that have been known to exceed amounts awarded to other sports teams . Some cheer teams put in more hours in the gym than teams such as football and basketball . Cheerleaders have to be in just as good physical condition as any other sport participant.Cheerleading in the early years was nothing like the sport it is today . Over the past few decade cheerleading has evolved from leading audiences with simple arm movements to treacherous towers of humans and elaborate dances that are used to show the athleticism of cheerleaders . Cheerleading has developed from selections based on popularity to one that now claims some of the more talented athletes in the school/program.Cheerleaders are not seen as athletes , but seen as being athletic . Cheerleaders are very specialized athletes . Most do not understand the skill and athleticism required by cheerleading . The gymnastics ability , power and strength make cheerleaders some of the more wellrounded athletes in sports . Cheerleading not only teaches coordination and helps condition competitors , but it also teaches teamwork , leadership , communication skills , organizational skills , productivity and much more.Cheerleading contributes to the overall physical fitness of those involved . Many teams are in the gym four to six days a week working out , practicing , stretching and conditioning for upcoming performances or competitions . Running increases one ’ s lung power and endurance . Stretching , jumping , taking gymnastics and aerobics all help keep the body toned and healthy . So as you can see , cheerleading practice and workouts are much like those of other sports.When it comes to funding issues , the sport of cheerleading is not equally supported . Monies are contributed to sports that do not consistently perform well . Cheer teams that do perform well usually do not receive the monetary compensations for their performances . Scholarships , donations from alumni , and extra funding to the school rarely get distributed to the cheer programs . Programs known for winning national titles over several years occasionally receive monies . I believe this occurs only once the administration realizes the need to keep those athletes in their program . Cheerleading does not bring the revenue to schools like football games ; however , the publicity that some cheer teams contribute to the school can be profitable in other ways.As a former cheerleader myself , I remember having long and strenuous practices which seemed to last forever . Because my life was so into cheerleading , I did and still consider cheerleading a sport . I have always told people who I ’ ve talked to about cheerleading that I consider it to be a sport . After being exposed to the competitiveness of cheerleading , I stand stronger behind my beliefs in the sport of cheerleading.Being a co-owner and one of the head coaches for Clarksville Cheer Extreme , an all star cheerleading gym in Clarksville , Tenn",0

"pls send me the english lyrics of the poem `` mi ultimo adios '' by Philippine hero Jose Rizal.. pls ... ? ? ? The Last Farewell ( English version of Mi Ultimo Adios ) by Jose RizalFarewell , my adored Land , region of the sun caressed , Pearl of the Orient Sea , our Eden lost , With gladness I give you my Life , sad and repressed ; And were it more brilliant , more fresh and at its best , I would still give it to you for your welfare at most.On the fields of battle , in the fury of fight , Others give you their lives without pain or hesitancy , The place does not matter : cypress laurel , lily white , Scaffold , open field , conflict or martyrdom 's site , It is the same if asked by home and Country.I die as I see tints on the sky b'gin to showAnd at last announce the day , after a gloomy night ; If you need a hue to dye your matutinal glow , Pour my blood and at the right moment spread it so , And gild it with a reflection of your nascent light ! My dreams , when scarcely a lad adolescent , My dreams when already a youth , full of vigor to attain , Were to see you , gem of the sea of the Orient , Your dark eyes dry , smooth brow held to a high planeWithout frown , without wrinkles and of shame without stain.My life 's fancy , my ardent , passionate desire , Hail ! Cries out the soul to you , that will soon part from thee ; Hail ! How sweet 't is to fall that fullness you may acquire ; To die to give you life , 'neath your skies to expire , And in your mystic land to sleep through eternity ! If over my tomb some day , you would see blow , A simple humble flow'r amidst thick grasses , Bring it up to your lips and kiss my soul so , And under the cold tomb , I may feel on my brow , Warmth of your breath , a whiff of your tenderness.Let the moon with soft , gentle light me descry , Let the dawn send forth its fleeting , brilliant light , In murmurs grave allow the wind to sigh , And should a bird descend on my cross and alight , Let the bird intone a song of peace o'er my site.Let the burning sun the raindrops vaporizeAnd with my clamor behind return pure to the sky ; Let a friend shed tears over my early demise ; And on quiet afternoons when one prays for me on high , Pray too , oh , my Motherland , that in God may rest I.Pray thee for all the hapless who have died , For all those who unequalled torments have undergone ; For our poor mothers who in bitterness have cried ; For orphans , widows and captives to tortures were shied , And pray too that you may see your own redemption.And when the dark night wraps the cemet'ryAnd only the dead to vigil there are left alone , Do n't disturb their repose , do n't disturb the mystery : If you hear the sounds of cittern or psaltery , It is I , dear Country , who , a song t'you intone.And when my grave by all is no more remembered , With neither cross nor stone to mark its place , Let it be plowed by man , with spade let it be scatteredAnd my ashes ere to nothingness are restored , Let them turn to dust to cover your earthly space.Then it does n't matter that you should forget me : Your atmosphere , your skies , your vales I 'll sweep ; Vibrant and clear note to your ears I shall be : Aroma , light , hues , murmur , song , moanings deep , Constantly repeating the essence of the faith I keep.My idolized Country , for whom I most gravely pine , Dear Philippines , to my last goodbye , oh , harkenThere I leave all : my parents , loves of mine , I 'll go where there are no slaves , tyrants or hangmenWhere faith does not kill and where God alone does reign.Farewell , parents , brothers , beloved by me , Friends of my childhood , in the home distressed ; Give thanks that now I rest from the wearisome day ; Farewell , sweet stranger , my friend , who brightened my way ; Farewell , to all I love . To die is to rest .",0

"what causes hiccups ? Hiccups are gulping sounds caused by involuntary spasms of the diaphragm . The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen and helps with breathing . Hiccups can be triggered if you eat too much or too fast , consume very hot or cold foods and beverages , or drink carbonated beverages . Other causes include cold showers , entering or leaving a hot or cold room , sudden excitement , and stress . Hiccups are not a serious medical condition and usually disappear on their own within a few minutes . If they last longer than 24 hours , hiccups may be a sign of another condition or injury . You should see your health care provider if you experience prolonged hiccuping . Home remedies are usually the primary treatment for hiccups , although no one is really sure how well they work . Hiccup home remedies include sneezing , being suddenly frightened , holding your breath , gargling , drinking pineapple juice , drinking water rapidly , sipping ice water , or swallowing dry granulated sugar . These activities may help by altering breathing patterns .",0

Combine a good diet , lean meats , no carbs after 6pm , only complex carbs before 6pm , plenty of veggies with a diligent exercise regimen of strength conditioning and aerobic exercise ( at least 3-4 times per week ) and you have your answer .

"MS : what are the drugs , life factors , foods , or whatever that cause MS to speed up and proceed faster ? After reading dozens of articles about what they do not know , what causes Mutiple Sclerosis to speed up , or causes relapses ? Certain life styles ? Foods ? Drugs ? Do any drugs make it speed up or flare up ? What is known ? Sun is bad , does it cause it to speed up too ? NCB Seems like they do n't know much about MS . The cause of progression in MS is unknown . A relapse can occur if you become over-heated , overly stressed , overly fatigued ... or it can just happen . No lifestyles that I 'm aware of make a difference in the progression . No foods , either . Supplements that boost your immune system should be avoided , because MS is a disease caused by an `` over active '' immune stem in the first place . Anything that stimulates your immune system could lead to a new attack or an exacerbation . The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people diagnosed with MS begin treating with the `` ABC '' drugs ( Avonex , Betaseron , or Copaxone ) as soon as possible . While they do not `` cure '' MS , they do slow down the progression of the disease and prolong the progression of disability .

"regicide in Macbeth ? why does macbeth feel more guilty about killing Duncan then he does about the other murders ? Of the people he had killed , King Duncan was the one who had confided in him . His wife , Lady Macbeth , upon hearing the prophecy , was the one that incited for Macbeth to kill King Duncan . This would then lead to him feeling guilt sa he had recieved kindness from a man whom his domineering wife wants dead . He had a choice between friendship and marital relations and he chose to obey his wife than risk her leaving him or something of that sort . Also , King Duncan also praised Macbeth for his greatness in battle . all his wife ever said about him was his cowardice in killing King Duncan . Since he chose to kill King Duncan from his wife 's desires , he lost a person that treated him well to one that treats him like a slave .",0

"who is Azazel in the Bible ? Azazel in LeviticusLeviticus 16:8 tells that the Lord ordered his high priest , Aaron , to 'place lots upon the two goats , one marked for the Lord and the other marked for Azazel ' on the Jewish Day of Atonement . The goat designated by lot for the Lord is to be used as a sin offering , while the goat designated for Azazel `` shall be left standing alive before the Lord , to make expiation with it and to send it off to the wilderness for Azazel . '' ( Lev 16:10 ) Aaron was to `` lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities and transgressions of the Israelites , whatever their sins , putting them on the head of the goat ; and it shall be sent off to the wilderness through a designated an . Thus the goat shall carry on it all their iniquities to an inaccessible region ; and the goat shall be set free in the wilderness . '' ( Lev 16:21-22 ) Leviticus also says that `` He who set the Azazel-goat free shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water ; after that he may reenter the camp . '' ( 16:26 ) From this passage in Leviticus , it would seem that Azazel is conceived of as a personal being , as lots were drawn for the Lord and for him . Also , Leviticus mentions that Azazel lives in the wilderness , as do the Se'irim . Because of this ritual , Azazel is known as the `` scapegoat . '' The goat that is sent to Azazel is not as a sacrifice , but as a symbol that there is no longer any unexpiated guilt . Both the goat and the man who leads away the goat are unclean , and the only way the man can reenter the camp is by washing his clothes and bathing . Azazel in the Apocalypse of AbrahamIn the Apocalypse of Abraham , Azazel is portrayed as an unclean bird which came down upon the sacrifice which Abraham prepared . This is in reference to Genesis 15:11 `` Birds of prey came down upon the carcasses , and Abram drove them away . '' `` And the unclean bird spoke to me and said , 'What are you doing , Abraham , on the holy heights , where no one eats of drinks , nor is there upon them food for men . But these all will be consumed by fire and ascend to the height , they will destroy you . ' And it came to pass when I saw the bird speaking I said this to the angel : 'What is this , my lord ? ' And he said , 'This is disgrace , this is Azazel ! ' And he said to him , 'Shame on you Azazel ! For Abraham 's portion is in heaven , and yours is on earth , for you have selected here , ( and ) become enamored of the dwelling place of your blemish . Therefore the Eternal Ruler , the Mighty One , has given you a dwelling on earth . Through you the all-evil spirit ( is ) a liar , and through you ( are ) wrath and trials on the generations of men who live impiously . '' - Apocalypse of Abraham 13:4-9The Apocalypse of Abraham also associates Azazel with Hell . Abraham says to him `` May you be the firebrand of the furnace of the earth ! Go , Azazel , into the untrodden parts of the earth . For your heritage is over those who are with you '' ( 14:5-6 ) There is also the idea that God 's heritage ( the created world ) is largely under the dominion of evil . It is `` shared with Azazel '' ( 20:5 ) Azazel is also identified with the serpent which tempted Eve . His form is described as a dragon with `` hands and feet like a man 's , on his back six wings on the right and six on the left . '' ( 23:7 ) Finally , the Apocalypse of Abraham says that the wicked will `` putrefy in the belly of the crafty worm Azazel , and be burned by the fire of Azazel 's tongue . '' ( 31:5 ) Here again , there is another reference to Azazel as being Hell .",0
"whats a quik way to lose fat ? ? in a pretty simple workout ? It was n't quick to put on fat and it wo n't be quick to lose it . It 's best to lose 1 - 2 pounds per week . To lose weight , cut back calories and exercise . Do both cardio exercise to burn calories and weight training / resistance training to build muscle . Muscle burns fat even when you are n't doing anything , so you want muscle.A simple cardio workout is walking or running . You do n't need any special equipment except for a good pair of sneakers . If you have n't run before , start with walking , and progress slowly with running intervals until you can run for 30 minutes straight.A simple resistance workout can include pushups , tricep dips , crunches , squats , and lunges . If you have or buy dumbells , you can also do bicep curls , chest presses , rowing , etc .",0

"What is a good start for a man over 40 , weight traning and cardio plan ? I am in fairly good shape . Matt , I would recommend that you start with a check-up with your doctor , just to make sure you are in otherwise good shape . Having done this you are good to go . Although not widely known , weight lifters normally have better cardio systems than runners , just not the lung capacity . At 40 , I would recommend starting with a moderate weight lifting routine on machines . Later you can switch to free weights as you get stronger . Free weights are better in some respect in that you have to control the weights . However , most modern machine weights are designed to give you a workout throughout the complete range of motion . Make sure you get plenty of rest between reps and do n't over do it to start with . Also add moderate stretching and decent nutrition . You do n't have to give up all good foods , because as you add muscle your body will consume more calories , even at rest . Sometimes the muscle aches caused by the minor tears in the muscle during working out do n't appear for 48 hours . The tears rebuild and realign into stronger muscle tissue . Take your time . Normally about 3 weeks of moderate weight lifting will begin to show results . A little weight gain can be expected if you are n't also dieting , but the weight gain does not mean size gain . Muscle is denser , so a pound of muscle is not as big as a pound of fat . Good luck ole boy and welcome to the over 40 club . By the way . Since I turned 40 I have dated women ranging in age from 19 to 56 , so if you are n't married , it 's a whole new world out there .",0
"Well i like this guy , and i think he likes me , but supposedly he 's just a really nice guy , what do i do ? Please help me , i have no clue what to do ! Guys are clueless ( at least I was ) . I had many women friends in high school and college that I thought were just friends .

Depending on your age , try just hanging out with him and talking to him . He 's not some alien from another planet . Guys often like women who can talk to them.Try group activities that involve him or casual things : tennis , a hike , bowling , coffee , ice cream , lunch.Get to know him and let him get to know who you really are . Do n't change to please him . Be yourself.And if you find yourself getting along really well , who knows where it will go . He may be your first kiss . You may find out he 's not interested in women or girls.But the first thing you have to do is to put yourself on his radar . And do n't expect things to happen `` over night '' .Good luck .",0

"what are the effects of the emergence of overseas filipino workers to the economy of the philippines ? One can certainly write a book about this topic , but here are a few consequences stemming from the increasing numbers of overseas Filipino workers , of OFWs.Sociological : many observers have noticed changes in the traditional family structure ; as a substantial portion of OFWs are women , they often work abroad to send money home to put their children through school ; thus , children often live in single parent households where the primary breadwinner is absent and gender roles are reversed , i.e . the mother is the breadwinner , while the father takes on the role of homemaker.Economic : overseas remittances are important in keeping the Philippines ' balance of payments in surplus ; as such , this preserves the level of reserve assets held by the Philippines , thus contributing to debt sustainability ( the country is one of the largest issuers of sovereign debt in the developing world ) and propping up the exchange rate ( thanks in part to the large inflow of overseas remittances from OFWs , the Philippine peso was one of the strongest performers vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar in 2005 ) .Political : given their increased importance in the economy , OFWs have rightly gained increased influence as a political constituency -- up until 2004 , overseas Filipinos were denied the right to vote ; because of their large numbers -- some estimates go as high as 8 million -- their vote could potentially swing an election ; however , as evidenced by the low turnout by eligible overseas Filipino voters in 2004 , huge logistics problems need to be tackled to fulfill that potential .",0

"can you tell me five facts about the violin ? i need some for a school essay The violin produces louder notes when the player either moves the bow faster or pushes down harder on the string . The two methods are not equivalent , because they produce different timbres ; pressing down on the string tends to produce a harsher , more intense sound.The location where the bow intersects the string also influences timbre . Playing close to the bridge ( sul ponticello ) gives a more intense sound than usual , emphasizing the higher harmonics ; and playing with the bow over the end of the fingerboard ( sul tasto ) makes for a delicate , ethereal sound , emphasizing the fundamental frequency.There are several methods of 'attack ' with the bow that produce different articulations ( 1 ) Détaché - The term détaché simply means ‘ separated ’ and it can be applied to any notes not linked by a slur . Stopping the bow on the string deadens the vibrations and thus creates a muted accent , elastic détaché which covered off-the-string strokes , and dragged détaché ( détaché traîné ) where smooth bow changes leave no audible gap between each note . Video Example of Detache . ( 2 ) Legato - Of successive notes in performance , connected without any intervening silence of articulation . In practice , the connection or separation of notes is relative , and achieved through the presence or absence of emphasis , Accent and attack , as much as silences of articulation ; degrees of connection and separation vary from legatissimo ( representing the closest degree of connection ) , tenuto , portamento , legato , portato , non legato , mezzo-staccato , Staccato ( the natural antonym of legato ) , to staccatissimo , and some of these terms have connotations going beyond simple degrees of connection or separation . ( 3 ) Sautillé - A bowstroke played rapidly in the middle of the bow , one bowstroke per note , so that the bow bounces very slightly off the string of its own accord . It is not indicated in any consistent manner : sometimes dots are placed above or below the notes , sometimes arrow-head strokes , and sometimes the stroke is simply left to the performer 's discretion . Spiccato and sautillé are sometimes used as synonyms , though Spiccato tends to be applied to a broader range of off-the-string strokes . Video Example of Sautille . ( 4 ) col legno - Occasionally the strings are struck with the back of the bow ( col legno ) . This gives a much more percussive sound , and is most effective when employed by a full orchestral violin section , since it produces little volume . ( 5 ) `` chopping '' - A more modern percussive technique , in which the hair near the bottom of the bow is struck against the strings . It is used by some jazz musicians , including the Turtle Island String Quartet .",0

"how can i get a high paying job ? Depends on what you mean by `` high paying '' . If it 's just about TONS of money then anything in the executive level is going to work for you . However , you will need at least a MBA in a business related field . Also , you will need to invest years into managerial jobs that will lead you up the ladder.OR - you can get a geat idea for some computer related start-up and get some venture capital and become successful ... however , lots of startups can ( and do ) fail.If your looking for a quick buck - sell drugs - but then go to jail or get killed.It 's really finding out what YOU like to do and then make it your life 's ambition to make it into a high paying job . Look at Bill Gates - he took a `` hobby '' and made it a life long goal . Not only that but he is wealthy more than I am sure he even dreamed he could be .",0
"how is dan fogelbergs health ? This was posted on Dan Fofelberg 's official websiteIn May of 2004 , Dan was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer.August 13 , 2005A personal letter from D.F.First , let me send everyone some very good news . In our first 14 months of treatment , we have succeeded in slowing the progression of my prostate cancer down to an almost negligible level . Jean and I are thrilled and incredibly relieved and finally feel like we can at last take a breath . While we understand that what we ’ re dealing with is a long term condition that will have to be dealt with , monitored and treated for probably the rest of my life , we are terribly encouraged to have come so far , so fast . It has certainly been the most trying experience of our lives and yet has proven to be one of the most illuminating as well ... ... ..I currently have no plans to return to the concert stage or the recording studio in the foreseeable future , but who knows ?

"What is better NonCommissioned Officers or Commissioned Officers ? ( follow-up question.. ) It all depends on what you mean by `` better . '' The officer corps are the managers of the military and are granted that rank by the President ( at least indirectly ) . Usually they are better educated , normally requiring a college degree . Have completed some sort of military training such as Officer Candidate School , the Military Academy or ROTC . This is followed by several months , typically , of training in their branch of service . The pay for officers and the breadth of their responsibilities are normally greater than those of NCOs.If the officers are the brains of the military , NCOs are the backbone . They are more specialized in their jobs and typically have less overall responsibility . However , they have worked up through the ranks and know how things work . For this reason , they supervise soldiers on a day-to-day basis to ensure objectives of 'management ' are met . They will typically have more experience than the newly commissioned lieutenant and the wise officer will solicit their input . Personally , I had more fun and a lot less politics as an NCO.Another category , between NCO and Officer , is Warrant Officer . This is a highly specialized individual normally with expert technical skills but lacking a normal commission . Examples may include some pilots . I have n't been one of these , but that seems the way to go ; - )",0

"Do you think kissing is cheating ? Even if she kissed hollywood star ? Well was she kissing them with the intent of getting into bed or just a peck on the cheek . Some people are comfortable greeting others with a kiss , and a hug . while others are only comfortable with a polite handshake.Each couple has to establish boundries . It reminds me of an event about 4 years ago when a married couple went to a Lions Football game . they stayed at the same hotel as the visiting team . while down in the lounge one of the ( PRO ) athelets was trying to pick up the wife right in front of the hubby . the wife was all game for sex with a star and hubby was not happy . Her answer was this is a once in a life time event . if you ruin it for me I 'll make you regret it for the rest of your life . and he responded by saying `` if I let you then I 'll still regret be the one regretting it for the rest of my life and so will you '' He then asked her what 's more important to her sleeping with a star or being married to me ? Her responce was to turn and leave with the pro and , off they went . Hubby in a fit of anger went back to the room packed all his clothers and hers and checked out . and drove home . On the way he contacted his atty . and filed for divorce . as well as canceled all the credit cards , and placed a stolen report on the checking account . Wifey several hours later after her little adventure with the ( pro ) was trying to get back into the room . and could not figure out why the card did not work . She contacted the front desk only to learn the hubby had left . She went crying back to the ( pro ) , and he laughed and asked her what did she expect no `` man '' worth his salt would want any thing to do with a `` slut '' once he is done with her . well after getting pissed , and the hollering and screaming between the lovers . the ( pro ) had her tossed out of the hotel for stalking . Now crying , and feeling miserable she tried repeatedly to call her hubby , and only got the Answering machine . she tried to use the credit cards and learned they did not work . Now thourly pissed in her own right she calls hubby back and rips him up one side and down the other and called him every name in the book , but eventually she found a ride home . only to learn all the locks on the house had been changes . He left a note on the door for her along with some cash telling her to go back to her hotel maybe she could sleep her way into another man 's life . Needless to say they ended up divorced , and she was left holding the bag as he got custody , and did not have to pay Alimony . So basically each person has to weigh the options in the relationship . You are the one who has to decide how you will handle the situation if it comes up . Read the book below it can help .",0

"in connectiom to my last question , Who gave us the knowlegde to be able to attain this said evolution ? Erin pls answer this one ... . all can answer ... . Thats the problem , we dont have to ask who created the creator because we are told that God just `` is , was , and always will be '' . The arrogance of man to think that we are smart enough to understand everything is our greatest downfall . Ever hear people say that when they think they know everything , they learn that they know very little ? Virtually everything that we know today was once unreasonable to the abilities of our brain . Just like no one knew about gravity until it was discovered and able to be measured . People thought the Earth was flat , and when they were told it was round , it took many years before they realized the person was right . Then they discovered later it was somewhat oval . Just because the most intelligent scientist in the world can not understand supernatural things , dont mean they dont exist . Maybe someday someone will discover a way to `` see '' these things too , so that everyone will have the knowledge . Just because it hasnt happened yet dont mean we are at the end of all learning , and it wont.The fact that we are the only animals on the planet that aspire for greatness , desire things that we dont need , and have learned how to create things ourself is proof that God created us in His image . We dont question why we have the ability to learn and evolve , we just take it for granted.Mankind has in effect became gods , because they forgot and no longer appreciate what created them . They believe as long as they can invent and create new things that now they are gods . This has been prophesied in Revelation . Part of being marked with the mark of the beast is man becoming their own god .",0

"Why is marijuana illegal while tobacco continues to kill and get rich ? `` Until 1937 , consumption and sale of cannabis was legal in most American states . In some areas it could be openly purchased in bulk from grocers or in cigarette form at newsstands , though an increasing number of states had begun to outlaw it . In that year , federal law made possession or transfer of cannabis ( without the purchase of a by-then-incriminating tax stamp ) illegal throughout the United States . This was contrary to the advice of the American Medical Association at the time . Legal opinions of the time held that the federal government could not outlaw it entirely . The tax was $ 100 per pound of hemp , even for clothes or rope . The expense , extremely high for that time , was such that people stopped openly buying and making it.The decision of the U.S. Congress was based in part on testimony derived from articles in the newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst , who was heavily interested in DuPont Inc . Some analysts theorize DuPont wanted to boost declining post-war textile sales , and wished to eliminate hemp fiber as competition . Many argue that this seems unlikely given DuPont 's lack of concern with the legal status of cotton , wool , and linen ; although it should be noted that hemp 's textile potential had not yet been largely exploited , while textile factories already had made large investments in equipment to handle cotton , wool , and linen . Others argue that Dupont wanted to eliminate cannabis because its high natural cellulose content made it a viable alternative to the company 's developing innovation : modern plastic . Still , others could argue that hemp could never truly compete with the high strength and elasticity of synthetics , such as nylon . Furthermore , hemp would have been an easy target due to its intoxicating effect , while no rational justification could have been made for outlawing cotton , wool , or linen .

"i 've seen alot of shoes left on the side of the street , some people say it 's a sign for some thing , what is it ? Some of the reasons for this which I have noted : Thieves drop stuff on the road they do not want and are trying to get rid of , often at night or early morning hours . I have even seen many boxes of very expensive cigars.Dogs play with shoes left outside or in trash.People who are drunk lose shoes.People who are struck by vehicle , sometimes shoe ( s ) come off.Stuff falls out/off vehicles while people are moving.Kids throw things out of cars.Some people throw things out of windows.Sometimes you see brand new boot or shoe , but seldom both left and right.Generally I think it is mostly a sign of carelessness and trashiness . Found in big city/environs much more than elsewhere.In Philadelphia I saw a huge difference between burroughs where there was a fine for littering and those where not.The trashiest city of all my extensive travels is Detroit , hands down the big winner.You can actually see people driving and flinging all fast food remnants and garbage out virtually any day . And lots of beer bottles 11pm -- 2am.So , I think it is trashiness and careless sign . In that regard it also reflects societal deterioration away from the desired norms of responsibility , care and cleanliness.The best solution is more of the latter . But that is also difficult to enforce . Nevertheless , I am for at least a $ 50 fine in urban areas , with an alternative of two days of participation in a clean up team . On second offense , both . On third offense , one month of weekends , same for fourth thru sixth . If someone does not reform after all that , I do not know what to do . Prison is too much a drain on taxpayer .

"How frequently do I use grunt and anteler calls while deer hunting in the rut ? It all depends on where you are hunting and what the buck to doe ratio is . If you are hunting on public property and the buck to doe ratio is 1/5 or worse you will want to be very timid with your calling . For one there is not much competition for does so the fighting does not occur as much and for two if you are on a heavily hunted area and other people are calling wrong or overcalling all they are doing is educating the deer and they will not respond as well to the calling . If you are hunting on private property or in an area where the buck to doe ratio is 1/3 or better the rules will change . You can be more aggressive and make more mistakes and they will not be as costly . I was watching the outdoor channel the other day ( ca n't remember wich program ) but this guy in texas was rattling and grunting constantly , I could n't believe how aggressive he was being and how constant he was doing it , but it was working very effectively .

"Why does it hurt when I clean my ears ? For as long as I can remember cleaning my ears has been a painful experience . Even the slightest swipe with a q-tip hurts and itches . As I make myself continue , I begin coughing for no apparent reason . I can not make myself stop even though there is no cause . I do feel a slight pressure in my throat which could be causing a gag reflex , but the coughing seem to violent for that explaation . Also my eyes water badly . For a long time afterwards my ears burn and itch.I do n't insert the q-tip too far into the canal . Mostly I just clean the outside , then get as best I can on the inside before ( a ) it hurts too bad to continue or ( b ) I am coughing and tearing so forcefully that I ca n't control the q-tip . Has anyone heard of this happening ? Has it happened to you ? Any information would be welcome . I am becoming increasingly concerned.Thank you . I 'm sorry I do n't have an answer for you . I just wanted to say that my ears do that as well . I cough , I feel like I 'm gagging , my eyes water , and sometimes I even sneeze . I hate cleaning my ears . I just wanted to tell you that you 're not alone .",0

"Why is Seriana such a great movie ? Syriana is a political thriller directed by Stephen Gaghan . Gaghan wrote the screenplay , loosely based on the book See No Evil by Robert Baer . George Clooney stars and was one of the film 's executive producers ( along with Steven Soderbergh , Ben Cosgrove , and Jeff Skoll ) .The first scene in the movie is that of Pakistani immigrant workers boarding a bus to Iran to work in a Connex refinery . Later , they find out that they are being laid-off because of the loss of the bid to the Chinese , forcing them into poverty . This is where we meet the father and son ( Wasim Khan ) that will be central to this storyline.The movie 's title is somewhat ambiguous . Some have suggested that it comes from Pax Syriana , as an allusion to the necessary state of peace between Syria and the U.S. as it relates to the oil business . In a December 2005 interview , Baer told NPR that the title is a metaphor for foreign intervention in the Middle East , referring to post-World War I think tank strategic studies for the creation of an artificial state ( such as Iraq , created from the elements of the former Ottoman Empire ) that would ensure continued U.S. access to crude oil .",0

"Why , for the majority , is academia so liberal when it comes to politics ? Academia is so liberal because they learn so much about everything that the feel they must accept it all . So they begin to think of everything as relative , including right and wrong . Eventually they think they are so much smarter than everyone because they are so 'open-minded ' that they lose their souls in their quest to be 'open-minded ' . Not only will they support a religious Jihad that kills innocent people but they will blame it on the innocent people that are killed because we 'just do n't understand ' our attackers . So , in summary , academia is so liberal because they want to be relativists about everything . They forget that to have shades of gray , there needs to be black and white .",0

"How people judge people ? do you judge people by looks , personality , way-of thinking ... Initially , people judge people by appearance and actions , because these are the first things that you can observe about someone . You can judge this up close or from a distance . People usually judge based on comparing another person to their own appearance , and how much the appearance differs from their own appearance.If someone takes the time to get to know someone , they will judge a person on `` deeper '' issues : intelligence , ways of spending time , ways of treating others , and beliefs . Of course , these again are perceived by the person that is doing the judging , and they 're usually compared to their own characteristics/beliefs.Should people judge people ? Yes , and no . It 's good to have standards that you expect of people , in terms of how you are treated , and standards of common decency . However , one should keep in mind that this world would be a boring place if we were all the same , and that everyone does not have the same experiences that you have . So , although judging is hard to avoid , you have to control what you do with your judgements . And it 's always good to reassess what you think of someone . Try to get to know people better .",0

"how to grade elementary papers ? Your question is kind of open-ended . It truly depends on the grade .

If there is a mistake , I circle it and write oops ... and ask the child in person to fix it . I NEVER write negative comments in kindergarten so as not to discourage children . If you were looking at an older grade ( 3-6 ) a more definitive grade out of 100 points for example works easier for you and them . The parents and students can begin to gauge an approximate grade for the quarter and you can calculate one much easier . It also gives your final grades a basis to stand on.Whatever you decide , make sure you have the information to back up your final grades for the student.Stamps , stickers and smileys are popular but just make sure it does n't take away from the really great thing about the paper - the student 's accomplishment and hard work !",0

"how do I get over being hungover ? I feel really sick after the night I drink and it goes on around a day long . Is it my stomach or what ? I 'd appreciate your help about that . And Dehydration is what causes a hang over . Alcohol sucks the nutrients out of your body and gives you no real nutritional value . I would suggest before going to bed to drink Gatorade or some other electrolyte drink ( Powerade , Altima , Energy Water ) . This will slowly start to replenish you , though if you drank a lot , you 'll need more.Be sure to drink a lot of water throughout the day and eat some bread ( which will absorb some of the alcohol ) . Nutritious food through out the day will also help.If you feel really , really sick the night before , you could always throw up , drink some gatorade , sleep a lot , you 're more likely to wake up refreashed .",0

"why is missouri called the show me state ? There are a number of stories and legends behind Missouri 's sobriquet `` Show-Me '' state .

Congressman Willard Duncan Vandiver , who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1897 to 1903 . While a member of the U.S. House Committee on Naval Affairs , Vandiver attended an 1899 naval banquet in Philadelphia . In a speech there , he declared , `` I come from a state that raises corn and cotton and cockleburs and Democrats , and frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me . I am from Missouri . You have got to show me . '' Regardless of whether Vandiver coined the phrase , it is certain that his speech helped to popularize the saying .",0

"Does size of the male member really matter and if so why ? What about other dimensions ? If we 're talking strictly about sensation produced during the act of intercourse , then it 's the circumfrence that is more important than the length as the sensation comes from friction and you need a larger circumfrence to enhance skin to skin contact to make friction.Too many men think it 's the length when their women are complaining to their women friends of cramping and pain because their man tried to jam it all up there.The other poster said it 's technique and this is also true because if you 've got a long one your woman will make excuses not to have sex if you do n't learn how to use it properly .

I am a swimming coach , and when a parent goes out of their way to thank me or let me know they appreciate what I am doing , then I am more positive to the kids as a whole . Try being ridiculously nice to the jerk . Come a little early to a practice one day and watch the end , and then when all the girls go to the locker rooms walk up to the coach , introduce yourself , and tell him that the kids seem to be doing such a wonderful job and that you are so pleased with the progress they are all making . Making yourself as NICE as possible will make it harder for him to be mean to your daughter.Then , tell your daughter how proud of her you are for sticking with it even when its hard for her .

Once you get beyond this , the rewritable surface begins to deteriorate too much to store any data.According to Dell 's website , the optical drive options are either a CD-ROM drive , DVD-ROM drive , DVD-ROM drive with CD-R/RW , or a DVD-R/RW . Any chance it 's a DVD-ROM with CD-R/RW and you 're trying to burn a DVD-R/W disc ? Sorry , but I have to ask.Otherwise , the drive may be failing and in need of service . If this is the case , you can also purchase an external USB2 DVD+/-R/RW drive and use it instead .",0

"How do I install memory into my computer ? My computer savvy friend left me hanging w/ RAM she ordered for me via Ebay and no instructions.Have Gateway system bought secondhand . PLEASE , help me ! Installing Memory:1 . Open the case . You can leave all of the plugs in place and components attached.2 . Get grounded . Before touching the new memory or anything inside the computer , you need to get grounded . The easiest way to be sure that you are grounded is to use an inexpensive antistatic wrist strap that can be purchased at a local electronics or computer store . If you don ’ t have a wrist strap , touch the inside of the chassis while the PC is still plugged in ; this will ground you . Once you are grounded , unplug the computer from the wall.3 . Find the place to insert the module . Look for other memory like the memory you have just purchased . You will see empty slots next to the memory that is already in place.4 . Pick up the memory module by the side edges . Don ’ t touch the flat surfaces or the contacts along the bottom . Orient the memory to match the memory that is already installed . Insert the memory module in the first empty slot next to the currently installed memory . Different types of memory install slightly differently.a . DIMMs and most newer types of memory are simply inserted into the slot with a gentle downward pressure . The clips on both sides of the module must snap into place for the module to be properly seated.b . SIMMs are a slightly older type of memory found in most computers more than three years old . They are inserted at a 45-degree angle and then rotated to a vertical position . Again , the supporting clips will snap into place.5 . Replace the cover , plug in the computer , and turn it on . In some computers , you will see the amount of RAM scroll by , confirming that the computer has recognized the new memory . If the memory has not been installed properly , there may be error messages , or the computer may freeze . If anything seems abnormal , remove and reinstall the new memory . Once everything is running properly , you can hold down the ALT key while double-clicking on My Computer to see the System Properties screen which will confirm the amount of memory that your computer thinks is installed .",0

"What is best prop for Yamaha 250 outboard ? The selection of the best propeller is a combination of many different factors , such as type of boat , L.O.A of boat , type of hull , use and performance ( i.e . : better top end speed or increased load carrying performance ? ) First of all , for an engine like this I would recommend a stainless steel propeller . SS propellers are stronger than most all other propeller materials with main advantages : longer life and high hydrodynamic efficiency derived from stiffer blades . To select the optimum propeller for the use of your boat and motor combination , you should make some test runs , keeping the following guidelines in mind : -Have a selection of propellers to test with . -Use an accurate tachometer to measure RPM . -Use an accurate speedometer or some means ( i.e . : G.P.S . ) to measure boat speed . -Safely test each setup at W.O.T . -Make sure every test is with `` identical '' settings . ( i.e . : Boat load , trim angle , engine height , water conditions , etc . ) Since Yamaha 250 is a power trim equipped engine , it should be tested at optimum trim angle which is the highest trim position that can be run without excessive venting ( slippage ) either in a straight line or in turns . Selecting the right propeller while testing , you must have in mind that : -Engine RPM at W.O.T . must be within the recommended operating range with the rated horsepower RPM as the target number ( see specification in Operator 's Manual ) . -Increasing or decreasing propeller pitch directly affects engine load throughout its RPM range . -A high pitch and/or diameter propeller on an engine , will result in lower engine RPM throughout its entire RPM range for a given throttle setting . -A low pitch and/or diameter propeller on the engine , will result in higher engine RPM throughout its entire RPM range for a given throttle setting . -A boat 's hull design -- and condition -- may limit its overall performance . -Transom height , transom angle and engine trim angle , all affect propeller performance . -Atmospheric pressure , temperature , and humidity also affect engine performance , which directly affects propeller performance . -Salt water is more buoyant than fresh water ; this may cause some hulls to run faster than identical freshwater setups . -Water and wind conditions can play a big part in boat performance and propeller efficiency . -The boat 's load and position of the load can significantly affect performance.Generally , the rule of the thumb is that the correct size propeller will provide the best overall fuel economy and performance.If I could have some more data , I think I would be able to give a couple of suggestions concerning number of blades , pitch and diameter for your engine/boat combination .",0
"Who discovered the planet Pluto and how did it get its name ? Pluto was discovered by the astronomer Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona on February 18 , 1930 . In the matter of Pluto the discretion of naming the new object belonged to Lowell Observatory and its director , Vesto Melvin Slipher , who , in the words of Tombaugh , was `` urged to suggest a name for the new planet before someone else did '' . The name retained for the planet is that of the Roman god Pluto , and it is also intended to evoke the initials of the astronomer Percival Lowell , who predicted that a planet would be found beyond Neptune . The name was first suggested by Venetia Burney , at the time an eleven-year-old girl from Oxford , England . Over the breakfast table , one morning her grandfather , who worked at Oxford University 's Bodleian Library , was reading about the discovery of the new planet in the Times newspaper . He asked his granddaughter what she thought would be good name for it . Venetia thought that as it was so cold and so distant it should be named after the Roman God of the underworld . Professor Herbert Hall Turner cabled his colleagues in America with this suggestion , and after favourable consideration which was almost unanimous , the name Pluto was officially adopted and an announcement made by Slipher on May 1 , 1930 .",0

"What is Artificial Reefs ? What is Artificial Reefs ? Can you give me some website about it ? An artificial reef is a reef created by man in places where reefs do not occur naturally.To enhance recreational fishing and sport diving opportunities in coastal waters , and to increase the amount of productive hard-bottom habitat available overall , man can participate ( with significant help from nature ) in the creation of additional man-made , or `` artificial '' reefs . This is accomplished by placing suitable long-lived , stable and environmentally safe materials ( usually steel or concrete ) on a selected area of ocean bottom.Once the material is in place it acts in the same way that naturally occurring rock outcroppings do in providing hard substrate necessary in the basic formation of a live-bottom reef community . Since there is nothing artificial about the myriad of living organisms which eventually colonize and inhabit almost every square inch of these man-made structures , the term artificial reef may really be somewhat misleading . When properly designed , located and constructed with an adequate quantity of stable and durable substrate , man-made reefs can be equally as productive in theory as naturally occurring hard- bottom habitats , limited only by the life-span of the materials utilized . Given the variety of materials currently in use on many artificial reefs , some reef structures in place now could remain productive for the next one to five hundred years .",0

"How does one become a taxidermist ? I am looking for a career , but I can not and will not learn Algebra . Any suggestions ? IntroductionTaxidermy programs prepare people to create lifelike models of wildlife and fish . Students learn how to select materials from dead animals and how to use artificial resources such as glass , wax , and foam . They study methods to create needed parts and care for models . In addition , they learn to manage a business and advertise their services.OverviewThe Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti once said that `` the object of art is not to reproduce reality , but to create a reality of the same intensity . '' As an art form , taxidermy does exactly this.Contrary to popular belief , taxidermists do not take dead animals and stuff them for display . Although this practice used to exist , most taxidermists would frown upon this mere attempt to `` reproduce reality . '' Instead , taxidermists are artists who re-create `` a reality of the same intensity '' by using a combination of artificial resources and natural materials from animal corpses.If you 've ever been to a museum of natural history or science , you may have seen the work of a taxidermist . You might have seen the form of an antelope 's head mounted on wood or a lifelike representation of a jackrabbit in a setting crafted to look like a forest clearing.As a taxidermist , you help to preserve the memory of animals . Just as other artists do , you pay close attention to details that others might not notice . You look at color , texture , expression , and muscle movement . You combine crafts such as carpentry , woodworking , tanning , and molding and casting to give renewed life to these details . You also use the artistic talent required for drawing , sculpting , and painting.You might show your work at competitions , in shops and museums , or in the private homes of your customers.In taxidermy programs , you learn to build frames and forms to substitute for animal skulls and skeletons . You study the techniques for sculpting clay heads or bodies and finishing models with painting and preservation . You also learn to preserve animal components such as skin , feathers , and fur.Proprietary schools and some community colleges offer taxidermy programs . You can typically earn a certificate which takes anywhere from a few weeks to a year of full-time study after high school . ''",0

Direct quote from http : //www.rootsweb.com/~genepool/meanings.htm : `` To be somewhere with `` bells on '' refers to a practice peddlers had when they roamed the area west of the Appalachians selling wares . To avoid Indians , they traveled as silently as possible until they reached a settled area . Then they unmuffled bells hung around their horses necks to announce their arrival to outlying cabins . Hence , `` I 'll be there with bells on .

These trenches were also lived in , which produced rat infestation , constantly wet conditions , and poor sanitation . All of these will contribute to the spread of disease and trench foot which sometimes resulted in amputation and even death . To attack the machine guns the tank was developed and although early models were notoriously unreliable their use in the final months contributed to the Allied victory . Poison gas will kill , cripple , and blind thousands . Airplanes initially used only for scouting will later develop into fighters against other planes and bombers . This will lead to some of the best known participants of the war and the glory of being a pilot ( Red Baron , Rickenbaker ) . Finally the submarine will spread the war to innocents on passenger ships and slow commerce to England and from the United States . More importantly it was the German use of Unrestricted submarine Warfare ( along with the Zimmerman note ) that brought the US into the war . It was the infusion of large numbers of Americans with their aggressive fighting ability that will be the deciding factor in the Allied victory .",0

"teenage drinking has become a problem in our society why ? Teenage Drinking has been a problem since the begining of the production of alcholic beverages.It is considered a rite of passage to consume alcohol . Our social mores consider `` drinking '' a rite of passage . Peer pressure , media , and the acceptance sitgma that it 's OK to Drink are all around us.The problem will only be solved with Education , and a society that frounds upon the problem . A control over the Media and advertisment will also be needed . Much Like the ban on smoking , a campaign is needed to reach this eventual goal . Smoking negative media , and the ban on certain advertisement had reduced some of the smoking is cool attitude . The same needs to be applied to the alcohol industry .

If it has a network/Ethernet connection , a router or hub or switch ( depending on your network setup ) would be the easiest - if you have one of those three already , you would connect the printers network cable to the router or hub or switch and then should be able to set it up on both computers through Windows printer sharing .

"is this bird flu REALLY that dangerous ? or just a fad ? i mean ... u hear researchers are terrified by 3 deaths in one country 4 in another . malaria kills millions especially in africa .

And everytime one of those few people with it are treated , there is the chance that new strains resistant to that treatment will develop . The main difference between bird flu and malaria is that we generally have malaria isolated in africa , with few exceptions , where as we dont really know how far bird flu has spread . There 's also vaccines to prevent malaria and drugs to treat it.Also , bird flu hits and kills a person very fast.. typically wthin 3-4 days .

"is yahoo better or google ? My answer is google for the following reasons : Pros of Google : As a seach engine , google has the best relevance and presents the results in a way that I find easy to decide what pages are best for me . Its the best in terms of researching information.For makin money , a # 1 on google is worth many times more than a # 1 on yahoo . Yahoo ! blocks the top of the SERPs with sponsored ads.Google also has a neat interface . Yahoo is not bad too , but its interface is not that neat . The reason for that being it to be a portal . I think a nice interface is very important since people will come back more often if so.The relevance of search results make its 'Feeling Lucky ' feature pretty useful . Firefox address bar by defaults goes to 1 site listed on your search results.Google has tried to stay away from Spam/ misleading sites better than other search engines.Cons of Google : However , few problems with google , its web crawler dose n't capture hyperlinks from PDF files stored on net , a feature which Yahoo provides.Also , Google at present does not provide an index for video aggregation through the web crawler , a feature which Altavista provided since 1999 . The problems include accuracy of the media file . That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.Due to a larger share of 'searching ' community , Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs . Because most bloggers mention the word failure with President Bush 's name , the # 1 site on searching Failure is the website of President Bush.Yahoo is doing pretty good research in Search Technologies , for example Grokker.http : //www.grokker.com/grokker.html ? query=Anirudh % 20Koul & Yahoo=true & Daypop=true & numResults=250",0

Blood clots or inflammation ( superficial thrombophlebitis ) , when a blood clot and inflammation develop in a small vein near the surface of the skin .

If so you can check the lease to see if there is any violation of the terms of the lease.Regarding separation of church and state , I believe as long as the mission of the organization is nonsectarian , that is , providing assistance or service to those of all religions , then it is not violating church/state restriction .

I think you need to give some more information before anyone can fully answer your question.First , is your problem associated with your inability to `` connect '' ( or understand ) others ? Do you wonder if you 're normal or what normal behavior is ? Or , are you highly intelligent and find others not smart enough to have a meaningful conversation ? Or , is this an anxiety issue ? Do you worry about what others think of you ? Are you concerned that people will laugh at you or talk about you ? If this is a matter of having a tough time understanding other people , I wonder if you might have come from an alcoholic family ? I ask because sometimes children of alcoholics complain of these kinds of issues -- they ca n't integrate , do n't know how to behave normally , feel out of sorts . If you did come from an alcoholic family , seek out a local ACOA or AA meeting for support.If you feel anxiety seek out medical help . Drugs like Paxil can reduce social anxiety.Finally , if you feel as if you 're simply a misfit -- seek out other misfits . Do you have an odd hobby ? Find others with that hobby .

"Do u think we have too many social programs paid for by government or do we need more ?

ONly cost the government a few thousand.I am a Republican . I voted for Bush in 2000 . I 'm not some crazy communist.I think the safety nets are neccessary for people and government exists to ensure that people do n't fall through the cracks.So lets just consolidate some of the things , get better service , and get rid of the abuse.I think most people would agree with that idea.Its sickening when you hear that welfare agencies are advertising that they need more people to go on welfare so they do n't lose the funding the next year .

It is based on the teachings of Baha'u'llah ( 1817-1892 ) , Who is regarded by Baha'is as the most recent in a line of Messengers of God that includes Abraham , Moses , Buddha , Zoroaster , Christ , and Muhammad.Baha'u'llah taught that there is only one God and one human family , that all religions represent progressive stages in the revelation of God 's Will , and that humanity is reaching its long-awaited stage of maturity , when a peaceful and just world order can finally be realized.While restating the ethical and spiritual principles common to all religions , Baha'u'llah revealed new social principles and laws to lay the foundation of a global civilization . We invite everyone , regardless of race , religion or ethnicity , to study , worship and work with us to bring into reality the vision of humanity as one global family and the earth as one home.you might find a Bahai community or center in your city : )",0

"do u know about natual disaster concepts ? tsunami , cyclones , earth quakes A natural disaster is a catastrophe that occurs when a hazardous physical event ( such as a volcanic eruption , earthquake , landslide , hurricane , or any of the other natural phenomena listed below ) precipitates extensive damage to property , a large number of casualties , or both . In areas where there are no human interests , natural phenomena do not result in natural disasters.A cyclone is the rotation of a volume of air about an area of low atmospheric pressure . Cyclones are responsible for a wide variety of different meteorological phenomena such as tropical cyclones and tornadoes . Because of this , most weather forecasters avoid using the term cyclone without a qualifying term.An earthquake is a sudden and sometimes catastrophic movement of a part of the Earth 's surface . Earthquakes result from the dynamic release of elastic strain energy that radiates seismic waves . Earthquakes typically result from the movement of faults , planar zones of deformation within the Earth 's upper crust . Most earthquakes are tectonic , but they also occur in volcanic regions and as the result of a number of anthropogenic sources , such as reservoir induced seismicity , mining and the removal or injection of fluids into the crust.A tsunami is a series of waves generated when water in a lake or the sea is rapidly displaced on a massive scale . Earthquakes , landslides , volcanic eruptions and large meteorite impacts all have the potential to generate a tsunami . The effects of a tsunami can range from unnoticeable to devastating .",0

"Is drinking coffee bad for you ? Here are some of the benefits and risk of drinking coffee.BenefitsCoffee increases the effectiveness of pain killers—especially migraine medications—and can rid some people of asthma . Some of the beneficial effects may be restricted to one sex , for instance it has been shown to reduce the occurrence of gallstones and gallbladder disease in men . Coffee intake may reduce one 's risk of diabetes mellitus type 2 by up to half . While this was originally noticed in patients who consumed high amounts ( 7 cups a day ) , the relationship was later shown to be linear ( Salazar-Martinez 2004 ) .Coffee can also reduce the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver and prevent colon and bladder cancers . Coffee can reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma , a variety of liver cancer ( Inoue , 2005 ) . Also , coffee reduces the incidence of heart disease , though whether this is simply because it rids the blood of excess fat or because of its stimulant effect is unknown . At the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Washington , D.C. , on August 28 , 2005 , chemist Joe Vinson of the University of Scranton presented his analysis showing that for Americans , who as a whole do not consume large quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables , coffee represents by far the largest source of valuable antioxidants in the diet . [ 4 ] Coffee contains the anticancer compound methylpyridinium . This compound is not present in significant amounts in other food materials . Methylpyridinium is not present in raw coffee beans but is formed during the roasting process from trigonellin , which is common in raw coffee beans . It is present in both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee , and even in instant coffee . 6Coffee is also a powerful stimulant for peristalsis and is sometimes considered to prevent constipation ; it is also a diuretic.Many people drink coffee for its ability to increase short term recall and increase IQ . It also changes the metabolism of a person so that their body burns a higher proportion of lipids to carbohydrates , which can help athletes avoid muscle fatigue.Some of these health effects are realized by as little as 4 cups a day ( 24 U.S. fl oz , 700 mL ) , but others occur at 5 or more cups a day ( 32 U.S. fl oz or 0.95 L or more ) .Some controversy over these effects exists , since by its nature coffee consumption is associated with other behavioral variables . Therefore it has been variously suggested that the cognitive effects of caffeine are limited to those who have not developed a tolerance , or to those who have developed a tolerance and are caffeine-deprived.Practitioners in alternative medicine often recommend coffee enemas for `` cleansing of the colon '' due to its stimulus of peristalsis , although mainstream medicine has not proved any benefits of the practice.RisksMany notable effects of coffee are related to its caffeine content.Many coffee drinkers are familiar with `` coffee jitters '' , a nervous condition that occurs when one has had too much caffeine . Coffee can also increase blood pressure among those with high blood pressure , but follow-up studies showed that coffee still decreased the risk of dying from heart disease in the aggregate . Coffee can also cause insomnia in some , while paradoxically it helps a few sleep more soundly . It can also cause anxiety and irritability , in some with excessive coffee consumption , and some as a withdrawal symptom . There are also gender-specific effects , in some PMS sufferers it increases the symptoms , and it can reduce fertility in women , also it may increase the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women , and there may be risks to a fetus if a pregnant woman drinks 8 or more cups a day ( 48 U.S. fl oz or 1.4 L or more ) .A February 2003 Danish study of 18,478 women linked heavy coffee consumption during pregnancy to significantly increased risk of stillbirths ( but no significantly increased risk of infant death in the first year ) . `` The results",0

"New estimates for the cost of the Iraq war are up to 2 trillion dollars . Is this too much , or not enough ? A study by Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz and Harvard budget expert Linda Bilmes estimates the cost of the Iraq War at between $ 1-2 trillion ( the White house originally estimated costs of 100-200 billion . ) The study expands on budgetary estimates by including costs such as lifetime disability and health care for the over 16,000 injured . It also analyzes costs to the economy , including the economic value of lives lost and impact of factors such as higher oil prices that can be partly attributed to the conflict in Iraq . Is 2 trillion too much money to spend for the war against Iraq , or is it not enough ? it is to much money for a war that should of never been fought . i know that sadam housian is not a good person . but he did not bomb us . bin laden did . why arent we spending 2 trillion on a war with the guy who bombed us not with the guy that bushs daddy should have already gotten rid of . guess the apple dont fall far from the bush family tree .",0

It could be a hormonal imbalance , but it could be fine . Sometimes , when you are really stressed out or busy or not eating/sleeping/etc well enough , your ovulation will be delayed . So , try to think back to the time right after your last period ( before this one ) . If you were traveling a lot , or dealing with a lot of stressful stuff , maybe that 's the reason . I would say , just wait a few months and as long as you get back on a mostly normal schedule , do n't worry about it .",0
"Would Bush eventually be impeached ? ? His spying has taken a vicious turn.Who knows what cat might come out of the bag in the coming days ? ? Unfortunately , since both houses of the legislature are controlled by Republicans , the liklihood of President Bush being impeached is virtually nil.In order for him to be impeached , the House of Representatives would need to file articles of impeachment , which are passed by a simple majority . In order for this to occur , some Republican representatives would have to cross the aisle and vote with the Democratic minority . In the remote chance that this would happen , the case would be forwarded to the Senate for trial.Once in the Senate , two thirds of the present Senators would be required . Once again , since the Republicans control this part of the House , the liklihood of an actual impeachment occuring is remote at best.And on another note , punishment is determined by the Senate . They can choose to remove him from office , or do nothing should he be impeached . Again , the odds of anything happening are slim and none.While it 's nice to dream , we 're going to have to wait for President Bush to leave office in eary 2009 , unless the political landscape shifts drastically between now and then.Read the Wiki below for more info .",0

"If you were to die tonight , where will you spend eternity ? Every one spends time preparing for their lives here on earth . We focus on making money , which of course we need to pay bills and live with some kind of security . Yet for some , money is all they ever think about- and they become greedy and greediness leads to selfishness and people stop caring about what really matters . We stop caring about how precious life is . How God gave us the air we breathe and the ability to be creative and work towards building relationships with others and with God our creator . When we become greedy we lose out because our whole life is spent grabbing wealth so we can get ahead . Ahead for what ? New house , more cars , more hedonistic pleasures to fulfill the emptiness we really feel inside . The Bible says , `` money is the root of all evil . '' When you look around at all the evil in the world it most likely can be traced back to greed . We ca n't take it with us when we go . We came into the world naked and we 'll go out that way . Think about it ! What 's important ? I plan on spending eternity in Heaven with my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ ! You are right that the Bible says that Money is the root of all Evil and you cant take it with you !

Why do you think that we have different languages if we were all children of Adam and Eve ? There is the scientific viewing : Adam and Eve do n't exist . It is just a Christian belief . The Christian theory : Adam and Eve do exist . But the people of earth ( their generations ) started talking and decided to build a tower that could reach up to the sky to be as high as God himself . God was not happy so he made them all have different languages . They were angry at each other for everybody thought the other was speaking gibberish . The idea was put off because they could not communicate and all of them moved far away from each other . The Chinese talkers moved to China . The French talkers moved to France . and so forth ... .,0

"Is it natural to like women with a little more fat that average ? Everyone has there different levels of attraction to others . The only reason why anyone would think it is unnatural to like someone bigger than a stick is because society makes it an issue . If you like a girl with a lil meat then hey why does it matter what anyone else thinks . You know thicker women used to be reveered and of importance to men because it showed that she was healthy ( i am not talking about the morbidly obese ) Skinny women used to be thought of differently than they are today . All in All the way a person looks on the outside is n't really important . The most beautiful slender girl in the world can become the ugliest if she is a b***h with a horrible attitude and is ethically and morally challenged . I 've dated a couple of guys that were n't considered hot because they were good people and treated me well . I did marry a hotty though but not for his looks , for his heart . He is the greatest person I have ever known with the biggest heart and best attitude . Awesome sense of humor too . If hew didn n't have all that I would n't have married him .

"Legal action against online forum members ? A few years ago , I belonged to a lively forum . I was only one of about five people who did not care for a certain action among most of the forum members , which numbered in the hundreds . Soon , we opposers were attacked one by one , and driven out of the forum . I contacted the forum editor and discussed the posting rules with him . It turns out he was unwilling to do anything about this , so I resigned from the forum of my own free will . Since that time , I 've been maligned repeatedly , mainly by one person , and have discovered his posts giving out my personal details , including my description , telling people to beat me up if they saw me in public ! I never corresponded with this person outside the forum , nor within it . I 've lost touch with the few posters I called friends . Do I have any legal recourse ? The editor of the forum simply tells this person to knock it off for a short while , and he starts over again . Two years is more than enough time for this to be ended ! Mature , this guy is n't !

"what is the purpose of throwing of beads at the Mardi Gras mean ? New Orleans ' Mardi Gras revelers will spend today downing Hurricanes , gawking at naked flesh , and begging paraders for colored beads with the traditional plea , `` Throw me something , mister ! '' How did the bead-throwing custom begin ? The first recorded instances of Mardi Gras paraders tossing souvenirs to the crowd date back to the 1840s , when revelers costumed as aristocrats threw out baubles and sugar-coated almonds . Other , less savory characters preferred `` trick '' to `` treat '' and pelted onlookers with an assortment of dirt , flour , and quicklime . The dissemination of handouts—or `` throws , '' in Mardi Gras parlance—is widely believed to have derived from festival customs in Renaissance Europe , where pre-Lenten carnivals often involved projectiles ( hurled about after villagewide ale-and-mead binges ) . Some historians theorize that the tradition has roots in a pagan post-winter ritual , during which lucky peasants who 'd survived the cold months celebrated by throwing milled grain into the fields—an offering of gratitude to the deity ( or deities ) who had given them enough food to last.Glass beads did not become a New Orleans Mardi Gras staple until the 1880s , after Anglo-American `` krewes '' had formed to organize the loose-knit festivities . Legend has it that the first parade participant to use beads was a man dressed up as Santa Claus ; the ornamental strands were such a hit that other krewes picked up on the ritual . By 1900 , when at least 100,000 tourists a year flocked to the Crescent City for Mardi Gras , beaded throws were ubiquitous.Continue Articlewhy you fly nationalToday 's plastic-or-aluminum beads have earned substantial notoriety for their role in a sexual bartering system ; women often bare their breasts for a strand or two . ( And sometimes go the Full Monty for a particularly enticing throw . ) Despite claims that this custom dates back decades , a 1996 paper in the academic journal Social Forces could trace the beads-for-nudity movement only back to the 1970s.Bonus Explainer : A krewe known as `` Zulu '' has become famous for handing out ( not throwing ) Mardi Gras coconuts in lieu of beads . The practice ceased briefly in the 1980s , owing to liability concerns—no insurance company would cover Zulu , fearing that an errant coconut might dent a merrymaker 's skull . Zulu leaders appealed to the Louisiana state legislature , pointing out that beads and other Mardi Gras trinkets were exempted from liability laws . In 1987 , then-Governor Edwin Edwards signed the `` Coconut Bills , '' adding Zulu 's heavy , oblong handouts to the list .",0

"why does it feel good to kill brain cells ? should n't that feel bad ? First of all most of the substances that are widely believed to kill brain cells do not . They will however alter the chemistry of the brain . This is not to say that it 's good to do these things . It is mostly due to the anti drug histeria that began in the early 20th century . Most drugs were used as medicine in the early days . It 's when drug abuse occurs that it can be of such a detriment . You can do very real damage to your brain with some of the most widely used drugs available today , alcohol among them . But it is the inhalants that do the damage the fastest . They impart chemical compounds into the bloodstream instead of Oxygen . Thus the brain is robbed of its most vital element . Brain cells then die by the millions . The notion that you become brain damaged by using marijuana or opiates is a bit misleading . The balance of normal brain chemicals is altered , maybe forever , but they are still not killing brain cells . Cocaine is another drug commonly used . It effects the brain chemistry also , but is more damaging to the heart . It kills heart cells on contact in laboratory experiments . It may also be harmful due to the powerful solvents it contains as a residue leftover from its manufacturing process . If you are going to use these substances you should at least inform yourself as to the damage you 're doing to your body .",0

Mariah Carey , Singer Born : 27 March 1970 Birthplace : Huntington , New York Best Known As : Pop diva who sang `` We Belong Together '' Mariah Carey 's remarkable vocal range helped her gospel-influenced dance tunes reach the top of the pop charts in the early 1990s . Her hit albums included Mariah Carey ( 1990 ) , Music Box ( 1993 ) and Butterfly ( 1997 ) . Critics winked at Carey 's 1993 marriage to Tommy Mottola , the head of Sony Music and Columbia Records ( Carey 's label ) , but her vocal abilities and babe-appeal kept her in good standing with fans and made her a favorite on MTV . ( Carey and Mottola were divorced in 1998 . ) In 2001 Carey left Columbia to sign with EMI 's Virgin Records for a reported $ 100 million ; her first Virgin album , Glitter , the soundtrack to her semi-autobiographical 2001 movie , was widely considered a disappointment . In July of 2001 Carey was hospitalized for exhaustion , and the next month her publicists said that Carey was also receiving psychiatric treatment . The next year she split with EMI , which paid $ 28 million to buy out the remainder of her contract . By the end of 2005 she was at the top of the charts again , and her album , The Emancipation of Mimi , featuring the hit single , `` We Belong Together , '' earned 8 Grammy nominations .",0

"what is ocx ? Short for OLE Control Extension , an independent program module that can be accessed by other programs in a Windows environment . OCX controls end with a .ocx extension . OCX controls represent Microsoft 's second generation of control architecture , the first being VBX controls written in Visual Basic . A component software technology from Microsoft that enables a Windows program to add functionality by calling ready-made components . Generally called `` OLE controls '' or `` OLE custom controls , '' they appear to the end user as just another part of the program.OCXs are Microsoft 's second-generation component architecture . Unlike first-generation 16-bit Visual Basic controls ( VBXs ) , which were only written in Visual Basic , OCXs can be written in several languages and come in 16-bit and 32-bit versions . OCXs were renamed ActiveX controls and continue to use the .OCX file extension . Both VBX and OCX controls have now been superseded by ActiveX controls . However , ActiveX is backward compatible with OCX controls , which means that ActiveX containers , such as Microsoft 's Internet Explorer , can execute OCX components .",0

"Are there any Biblical verses that refute Mormon teachings ? Please explain. ? Way too many . Here is a good link to do some research.http : //www.carm.org/mormon.htmMormons not only claim to be Christians , but to be the only true Christians . According to them , the early Christian church went through an apostacy , lost the true teaching of God , and is built on a Bible that , according to them , is translated incorrectly and is missing many books.Interestingly , while LDS Church president Gordon Hinckley assures the press that `` the New Testament is a fundamental scripture for us , '' ( Note 1 ) he fails to point out the Mormons ' bias against the Bible.Article 8 of the Mormon Articles of Faith ( Note 2 ) says , `` We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it has been translated correctly . '' This approach allows Mormons to ignore key Bible Scriptures which refute Mormon doctrines . Bible verses used to counter Mormon teachings are brushed off in favor of passages from the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scriptures ( as well as ongoing revelation that often contradicts previous LDS Church teachings ) .It should be noted that the LDS Church has published its own version of the King James Bible , incorporating footnotes explaining what corrections from Joseph Smith 's `` inspired version '' of the Bible ( a version full of errors and plagiarized material ) should be taken into account.However , in spite of their efforts at revisionism , Mormons have not been able to support their claims . On the contrary . While Mormon allegations regarding the Bible and the course of Christianity are refuted by history , archeology , and other sciences , the scriptures of the Mormon church are problematic at every turn . Far from showing us so-called 'restored truth , ' they are testimonies to the deceptive nature of Mormonism .",0

"How long is the average penis ? What is the length of the longest docuemnted penis ? Your penis is like an artist ’ s paintbrush . It ’ s not how long it is that matters . It ’ s how skillfully you use it and how many different brush strokes you know.These penis size questions come up again and again on this site . Women almost always say it doesn ’ t matter to them . And if it actually does matter to a small minority of women , so what ? There are still plenty left who don ’ t think it ’ s very important . What ’ s far more important is whether you ’ re skilled at using your penis to satisfy your woman . Can you last as long as you want ? Can you vary the depth of your strokes , the pace of them , the angle of them , so that you can offer your woman a little teasing and unpredictability at times ? Are you skilled enough at other ways to pleasure her , so that penis-vagina intercourse is only one of the things on the menu you offer her ? Even if you can ’ t do all of these things at present , these are all things you can LEARN to do . But you can ’ t learn to have a bigger penis.And let ’ s not forget , it ’ s usually the person attached to the penis that decides whether a woman finds you appealing or not . You could be hung like a horse , but if you ’ re an inconsiderate jerk you still won ’ t be very attractive to women .",0

"what etiquette , respect and rules does one need to follow as a tourist in Dubai , united Arab Emirates ? Hi - I 've only been to the airport in Duabi , but here are some pointers I found : DressAlthough the UAE is very liberal in many respects , the correct dress code is important in order not to cause offence . Conservative clothes that cover the body and limbs are preferable to casual shorts and sleeveless tops for both sexes , especially in rural areas where tradition is important.Indeed , long , loose clothing can be much cooler and more comfortable than smaller items that expose the skin to the hot sun.The Arab national dress worn in Dubai is made especially to keep the wearer cool during the hottest of weather . Men wear the kandoura or dishdasha , a white , ankle-length garment which is a loose fit and very effective in the hot and cold.Women wear an abayah , which is a black , long-sleeved , full-length robe . Both men and women wear head coverings to protect their heads and faces from the sun and windblown sand.Traditional garments are also ideal for when the temperature drops sharply at night.PhotographyNormal tourist photography is acceptable , but it is considered offensive to photograph Muslim women . It is also courteous to request permission before photographing men . Always avoid taking photographs of anything even remotely military , such as buildings , perimeter fences , vehicle convoys , checkpoints , airports and so on.TippingTipping practices are similar to most parts of the world . Where no service charge is included , 10 % is adequate.BargainingBargaining is an expected part of buying in the souk and elsewhere . Traders will usually drop their prices , often quite substantially , particularly for cash sales , but it is important to be polite at all times and not feign anger or disgust.RamadanDuring this month of fasting , pious Muslims will not eat anything during daylight hours , with most conforming to the injunctions . Foreigners are not expected to follow suit , but it is considered impolite to smoke , drink or eat in public during Ramadan . In general , I 've heard that it 's a fantastic place to go for so many reasons ! I 'm envious - have a great time .",0
"I cant pay for college how do i make more $ with only high school ? You are n't going to be making a lot of money with just a high school degree unless you have some new invention or idea that will revolutionize the world.There are a lot of grants and scholarships out there that will pay for your college as long as you do well while you are in college so that they continue to give you funding.Actually the poorer you are the more free money you will get . If you have done well in high school the easier it is to get funding . You can also get scholarships from all over the place . There are a lot of places to look on the internet for scholarships and the college you pick can also assist you in finding scholarships.At the very least there are student loans that will pay for your college and you have to pay those back when you have completed college , but it is well worth going to college than not going .",0

They are currently feeding Americans propaganda about how you want us in your country and how the soldiers do n't have time to kill anyone in Iraq because they are so busy handing out crayons and toys to Iraqi children .

Scriven defines “ models ” : as a term loosely used to refer to a conception or approach or sometimes even a method ( e.g. , naturalistic , goal-free ) of doing evaluation ...

His best known model is Goals-Free Evaluation which supplements inherent weaknesses in a goals-oriented approach by providing an unbiased perspective of ongoing events . Developed in 1972 , this model in this model , the evaluator begins by examining outcomes of the program and attempts to infer the intended objectives from these observations.The evaluator then identifies and interviews actual participants rather than program management and staff .

Being one of those black folks myself I can say without hesitation that the use of the N-word is most certaintly NOT 'okay ' , regardless of who says it .

"Why is the color in a 50 year old movie so much better than in a new movie ? `` better '' is a very subjective term . Technicolor process films allowed for super-saturated colors to be seen in the final print . Currently there is n't any process similar to that in wide use . Technicolor used three strips of black and white film , each exposed through a filter ( red , green , blue ) to capture the original images . Then in a lab , each of the black and white strips were exposed against color film print stock with the same color filter . This process also led to occasional color mis-registration in some films where the lab work was rushed or done sloppily.Most modern films are shot on single-strips of negative with three dye layers of emulsion that are each sensitive to different color wavelengths . ( see the first link below ) A very popular film stock these days is Kodak 's 5279 `` vision 500T '' which has a very high ISO yet does n't get as grainy as previous high ISO films . ( see second link below ) Because films nowadays are shot on single-strip film , super-saturating colors requires post-processing for color-timing , such as digital intermediate processing ( see link 3 below for Discreet 's DI product info . ) Directors also like to have a lot of creative control over the look and feel of a film that is done through the color timing process ( see the 4th link , although the entry is incorrect as Pleasantville was the first film to be completely digitally color-graded in 1998 ) This can include adding hues or increasing or reducing contrast - good examples are in Cinderella Man and Lord of the Rings : ROTK",0

With over 250 million copies of her novels in print , she has come a long way since she wrote her first novel in a spiral notebook using a No . 2 pencil . Now she has published over 150 novels and her work has been optioned and made into films , excerpted in national magazines and translated in over twenty-five different countries . `` I always have stories running around in my head , '' she explains . `` Once I start putting them down on paper , I just keep going ; I just keep writing . '' In addition to her amazing success in mainstream fiction , Nora Roberts remains committed to writing for her category romance audience that took her to into their heart in 1981 with her very first book , a Silhouette romance . Nora Roberts continues to write futuristic romantic suspense as J.D . Robb , and her characters Eve Dallas and Roarke have become two of her most popular creations ever . Her J.D . Robb titles are hailed as `` a perfect balance of suspense , futuristic police procedure and steamy romance ... truly fine entertainment '' by Publishers Weekly . Reviewers agree that Nora Roberts deserves praise . The Los Angeles Daily News describes her as `` a word artist , painting her story and her characters with vitality and verve . '' Kirkus Reviews comments on True Betrayals saying `` Roberts ' style has a fresh , contemporary snap .

'' They add , `` When Roberts puts her expert finger on the pulse of romance , legions of fans feel the heartbeat . '' USA Today calls Nora `` a consistently entertaining writer . '' The remarkable Ms. Roberts did not become a success overnight . By the time her first novel , Irish Thoroughbred , was published in 1981 , she already had three years of hard work behind her and several rejected manuscripts languishing in drawers . Today , according to Entertainment Weekly , `` her stories have fueled the dreams of twenty-five million readers . '' One of America 's leading novelists , her books are published around the world . She is frequently invited to promote her novels in other countries . Her recent travels took her to England , Italy , Australia and Japan to meet fans , fellow authors and aspiring writers .

"Why Iran Should Stop Researching on Nuclear Knowlage ? With all due respect , sgt_k is a total idiot , learn how to respect others ' opinion then start talking ... back to the topic , well , yes , i agree with yunussh ... for the following reasons : 1- we have known what is the meaning of being told by america that somebody or a country is having a mass destruction weapons , it 's a big lie like what happened in iraq , but iran would never let america do the same thing , simply iran can make what the american would never expect . 2- we know that israel has a nuclear power , it threats all the muslims around it , who knows if they have n't already invent a bomb with a short range of action that , for example , can destroy egypt without affecting israel itself ? , that 's why , countries near israel has the right to defend themselves in the way they can , you ca n't stop iran unless you assure the whole world is having nothing called nuclear power . 3- america is doing all that because of israel , techniquely speaking , iran ca n't threat amecrica in a way or another ! they are thousands of kilos far away , but when it is about israel , yes america can do any idiot step for the sake of israel , why ? because isreal , 10 million people , is controlling every single step america is doing , shame on you american ! finally , do n't ever dream that what happened to iraq will repeat itself , , , american soldiers themselves wo n't accept a new war and now they know that a muslim can really be happy to die when it 's about making strangers out of his country , , leave us alone , or u never be in peace ... gourge bush or any other president , american will never elect a president who hates israel , that 's why we never expcet a good thing from you , america .. now , was it convincing ?",0

"Which is the fastest computer in the world ? Well , there are three perspectives to your question , which are as follows : ( 1 ) A super computer ( 2 ) A desktop computer ( 3 ) Anything in a general sense that can compute.For the third perspective , The fastest computer in the world is much faster than the desktop in front of you , and it is sitting right on top of your shoulders ! The human brain is an amazing computing device and the fastest processor available right now . In supercomputers , the BlueGene/L - eServer Blue Gene Solution stationed at DOE/NNSA/LLNL at Livermore in California is ruling the world . It has , hold on your breath , 131072 processors , each processor with an individual performance of 2.8 GigaFlops ( PowerPC 440 700 MHz ) . It has a main memory of 32768 GB and is 3 times more powerful in processing than its immediate competitor ( Also by IBM ) . Surprisingly , its still in expansion phase . Blue Gene is an IBM Research project dedicated to exploring the frontiers in supercomputing : in computer architecture , in the software required to program and control massively parallel systems , and in the use of computation to advance our understanding of important biological processes such as protein folding.As for the fastest desktop configuration , it keeps changing every now and then . An interesting fact to note , Intel had come up with 4GHz chip , but could not commercialize it because of the excessive heating which could damage the chip . Hope to see such a chip soon . As on 6th January 2006 , Xi MTower 64 AGE-SLI is considered to be the fastest desktop Computer . Equipped with a 2.4-GHz Athlon 64 X2 4800+ CPU , 2GB of DDR400 SDRAM , a single EVGA E-GeForce 6800 Ultra graphics card , and two 300GB hard drives striped in a RAID 0 array , The $ 3897 gaming and graphics system justifies its high price with lots of speed and excellent expandability .

"principle of subsidiarity whay does mean ? SubsidiaritySubsidiarity is the idea that matters should be handled by the lowest competent authority . The Oxford English Dictionary defines subsidiarity as the idea that a central authority should have a subsidiary function , performing only those tasks which can not be performed effectively at a more immediate or local level . The concept is applicable in the fields of government , political science , cybernetics , and the management of large organizations . Subsidiarity is , ideally or in principle , one of the features of federalism . The word subsidiarity is derived from the Latin word subsidiarius and has its origins in Catholic social teaching . It is found in several constitutions around the world ( see for example the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ) . It is presently best known as a fundamental principle of European Union law . According to this principle , the EU may only act ( i.e . make laws ) where member states agree that action of individual countries is insufficient . The principle was established in the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht , and is contained within the proposed new Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe . Catholic social teaching The principle of subsidiarity holds that government should undertake only those initiatives which exceed the capacity of individuals or private groups acting independently . The principle is based upon the autonomy and dignity of the human individual , and holds that all other forms of society , from the family to the state and the international order , should be in the service of the human person . Subsidiarity assumes that these human persons are by their nature social beings , and emphasizes the importance of small and intermediate-sized communities or institutions , like the family , the church , and voluntary associations , as mediating structures which empower individual action and link the individual to society as a whole . `` Positive subsidiarity '' , which is the ethical imperative for communal , institutional or governmental action to create the social conditions necessary to the full development of the individual , such as the right to work , decent housing , health care , etc. , is another important aspect of the subsidiarity principle . The principle of subsidiarity was developed in the encyclical Rerum Novarum of 1891 by Pope Leo XIII , as an attempt to articulate a middle course between the perceived excesses of laissez-faire capitalism on the one hand and the various forms of totalitarianism , which subordinate the individual to the state , on the other . The principle was further developed in Pope Pius XI 's encyclical Quadragesimo Anno of 1931 , and Economic Justice for All by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops . Quadragesimo Anno In the encyclical Quadragesimo Anno , Pope Pius specifically said at paragraphs 79 and 80 : 79 . As history abundantly proves , it is true that on account of changed conditions many things which were done by small associations in former times can not be done now save by large associations . Still , that most weighty principle , which can not be set aside or changed , remains fixed and unshaken in social philosophy : Just as it is gravely wrong to take from individuals what they can accomplish by their own initiative and industry and give it to the community , so also it is an injustice and at the same time a grave evil and disturbance of right order to assign to a greater and higher association what lesser and subordinate organizations can do . For every social activity ought of its very nature to furnish help to the members of the body social , and never destroy and absorb them.80 . The supreme authority of the State ought , therefore , to let subordinate groups handle matters and concerns of lesser importance , which would otherwise dissipate its efforts greatly . Thereby the State will more freely , powerfully , and effectively do all those things that belong to it alone because it alone can do them : directing , watching , urging , rest",0

"what is a brake lining ? Brake linings are composed of a relatively soft but tough and heat-resistant material with a high coefficient of dynamic friction ( and ideally an identical coefficient of static friction ) typically mounted to a solid metal backing using high-temperature adhesives or rivets . The complete assembly ( including lining and backing ) is then often called a brake pad or brake shoe . In this view of an automobile disc brake , the brake pad is the black material held by the red metal component ( the brake caliper ) . The brake lining is that part of the brake pad which actually contacts the metal rotor when the brake is engaged.Using a typical bicycle brake as an example , the backing would be the metal shell which provides mechanical support , and the lining would be the rubbery portion which contacts the rims when the brakes are applied . In most modern vehicular applications the system is conceptually identical , except the rims would be replaced with solid steel ( or sometimes exotic metal ) rotors . Furthermore , a metal tang is usually incorporated into the pad assembly . The tang contacts the rotors when the linings are worn out , causing an annoying noise designed to alert the motorist that brake servicing is required.Since the lining is the portion of the braking system which converts the vehicle 's kinetic energy into heat , the lining must be capable of surviving high temperatures without excessive wear ( leading to frequent replacement ) or outgassing ( which causes brake fade , a decrease in the stopping power of the brake ) . Due to its suitability , asbestos is often a component in brake linings ; as a result , brake dust should never be inhaled",0

"I 've been deported once . It was my big mistake . But i really want to come back . Becouse i loved this country You will first need to apply for some type of immigrant or non-immigrant visa .

If you have an employer who wants you to work for them , they might be willing to help you with a work visa or permanent residence . If you have an immediate family member in the US who is a resident or citizen , they can apply for you . Once that application is approved , you have to apply for a form I-212 permisson to reenter after deportation if you were deported less than five years ago .

"What kind of psychotherapy works the best ? The answer to your question is not easy . Some therapists use a limited approach ( ie . only interpersonal , focused on your relationships with others . ) In my opinion , CBT ( Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy ) is often successful if other approaches have failed .

It is Invitation-Only , so that it is not open to misinformation . ( people who can access the site can also edit it to add their own research , and experiences . ) The answer to your question is that depending on the reason you are seeking psychotherapy , different methods will work best.I think this is really a multistep question , so I am going to give you some sources of information and then ask you to come back for a follow-up.WebMD.com , using experts from the Cleveland clinic ( WebMD uses different sources , some of which are not very comforting ) , has a detailed article on psychotherapy I highly recommend : http : //www.webmd.com/content/article/60/67128.htmI am going to add to this . The first thing you should discuss with any therapist is what brought you to see them , and what your goals are , and also billing . Insurance will often cover up to a certain amount ; some therapists or social workers ( both do therapy to some degree ) work on a sliding pay scale ( ie . they negociate on rate you pay . ) http : //www.webmd.com/content/article/60/67128.htmMy local counselor here at Earlham College in Richmond , IN says that eclectic therapists are the best -- ie . the ones that can use any approach that seems helpful .

what is a double layer DVD burner ? Movie DVDs you buy in the store can contain up to 8.5 gigabytes of data . This is because they are pressed ( as opposed to burned ) dual-layer DVDs ( also called DVD-9 ) . The recordable DVD+-Rs that have been on the market for a while a single-layer DVD-5s and can store up to 4.7 gigabytes . This disrepency is why programs that copy movie DVDs need to compress the DVD content after unencrypting it before they can be burned to a normal DVD . Recently new DVD burners and media were introduced that allowed people to burn DVD-9 DVDs reasonably affordably.So a double-layer DVD burner is one that is capable of burning 8.5 gigabyte DVD-9 format DVDs.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd # Technical_information,0

"Getting started as a Financial Analyst ? I have a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and have over 5 years of experience in the field . Unfortunately I 've decided that it 's not my cup of tea and I have recently looked into switching careers.I 've always been an analytical and thorough person so I feel a career as a financial analyst in a corporate setting ( as opposed to an investment bank ) would suit me well . I 've already taken about 6 accounting classes and have gotten A 's in all of my classes . The only problem is , I do n't know where to get started . What 's the best way into the position ? My options at the moment are : * Get an Associates Degree in Accounting* Get a second Bachelors Degree in Accounting/Finance* Get a Masters Degree in Accounting* Take the CPA exam w/o the required work experienceOut of all of these options , what 's the best choice in getting hired ? I believe your best option is to obtain your bachelors degree in accounting/finance . Inherently , this is a more attractive degree due to the amount of education obtained . Furthermore , any respectable company will require a bachelors degree for a financial analyst position.While the other two options are not bad , they will not help you greatly so I would do them only if it is in addition to the second bachelors degree . Passing the CPA exam without the work experience will not obtain you your certification , which is the true `` resume value '' so you would have only passed a test and would have an interest dinner conversation piece at best.The masters degree in accounting is also nice as a supplement to your bachelors degree , but entirely unnecessary .

( Glycosylated hemoglobin [ HbA1c ] should be less than 7 % . ) Renal disease - Proteinuria is a good marker for the development of DR ; thus , patients with diabetic nephropathy should be observed more closely.Systemic hypertension - Increased risk of retinopathy ( DR with superimposed hypertensive retinopathy ) Triglycerides and lipids - Normalization of lipid levels reduces retinal leakage and exudates deposition.Pregnancy - DR can progress rapidly in pregnant women , especially those with preexisting DR . Physical : Funduscopy under stereopsis and high magnification should be performed on every patient with diabetes to assess for DME and DR.

Just make sure you pay Uncle Sam his fair share , you should be fine in the general sense . Some other obligations : jury duty - DO NOT throw away your jury notice ! Some courts are very serious in enforcing and cracking down on those who dodges jury duty . Selective service - if you 're male under 28 years old , you need to register .

"Why do non-smokers want to be around smokers , just to have it banned in clubs and pool halls ? ? ? ? In the Chicagoland area it is a ban in nightclubs , bars , pool halls and every where else that smokers goto to have fun . Its the same in Madison , Wis . There is a smoking ban just about everywhere you go . If you are a non-smoker then dont frequent places where smokers are and vice-versa for smokers . Everyone has the right to smoke if they want . They say smoking causes second hand Canser , well if that is so then seeing people eat to much causes eye canser . You all know what I mean . I do n't think that smoking should be banned in bars and in clubs . If they are banning things that are bad for you they would n't be able to drink there either . I think that if you are so health oriented you should n't be in the bar so if you do n't want to be around smokers do n't go in the bar . Drinking and smoking go hand in hand and some people that drink like to smoke only when they drink . I think it should be up to the bar owner . If the waitresses do n't like being around it , get another job at a bar that does n't allow smoking .",0

"what 's ur idea about iran and NUCLEUS energy ? The idea to contain nuclear proliferation is to have as few countries as possible have atomic weapons . On the other hand any country can use nuclear energy for electric production . A number of countries will assist other countries in constructing a peace nuclear energy plant.The problem occurs when a country wants to develop their own nuclear industry , purportedly for peaceful purposes and their government is not stable and their plans for such development are clearly for weapons development . Iran falls into this latter category.Russia has offered to develop for them ( on Russian soil ) the nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes and Iran has turned this down . They want nuclear weapons and they already have the missile systems which deliver them at least as far as Europe . They support the destruction of Israel and it is a surety that if they had such weapons they would use them.They will be helped to have atomic energy plants for peaceful purposes , they will not be allowed to have an atomic weapons development program . .",0

"The End Times : Great Revival or Great Apostasy ?

And because iniquity shall abound , the love of many shall wax cold . But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved . ( Matthew 24:10-13 ) And why would He ask : ... Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ?

"Is there any effective home remedy for skin tags ? A dermatologist will freeze it then if necessary cauterize ( burn ) it.You can do this at home by buying a wart removing medicine that freezes the skin . After following the directions on the package for about 1-2 weeks you will notice that the `` tag '' will fall off then your skin heals over time . You can also burn it off by going to the same wart removing isle in the pharmacy and buying Salicylic acid . This is the stuff that is used in acne medicine but acne medicine has very little percent per volume . Buy the real stuff , it 's available over the counter in the wart removing section and dab a little bit on each skin tag . Follow the directions as noted in the package and you will notice that the skin tags will fall off and the skin will heal after a while .",0

"I recently discovered that my ascendant sign was Aires rather than cancer , how would this affect my chart ? My sun sign is `` virgo '' and I 'm particularly interested in the `` Love '' and `` Career '' elements of my chart . It mainly affects which horoscopes you should read . The rising sign is just as important as the Sun sign , and sometimes more so . You need to read Aries as well as Virgo.Horoscope forecasts are written as if each sign is in the rising position ( the `` 9 o'clock '' on a horoscope chart ) . Houses are arranged counterclockwise : the second house is at `` 8 o'clock , '' the third house is at `` 7 o'clock , '' and so on . If you 're a Virgo with Aries rising , Aries is at `` 9 o'clock '' ( first house ) and Virgo is five signs away at `` 4 o'clock '' ( sixth house ) .Horoscope forecasts describe events that relate to planetary activity in the houses . They 'll often describe the effect of a particular planet on each of the signs , and the planet will affect each sign in different ways.Let 's say the day 's forecasts talk about a planet that 's currently in Saggitarius . In a Virgo forecast , this would affect the person 's home and family life , since Sagittarius is on usually on the cusp of the fourth house of a chart with Virgo rising . This forecast would only be relevant to people of *any* sun sign with Virgo rising , but not Virgos with a different rising sign . A person with Aries rising ( and *any* sun sign ) would read the Aries forecast . That same planet in Sagittarius would affect the Aries forecast differently : The forecast would likely describe travel , higher education , or religion , since since Sagittarius is on usually on the cusp of the ninth house of a chart with Virgo rising . This forecast would only be relevant to people of *any* sun sign with Aries rising , but *not* Aries people with a different rising sign.This is why you need to read the chart for your rising sign ( Aries ) , so that you get the correct effect of the planetary activity in question.Hope this helps .",0

"how do I date a woman and make her feel confortable with me ? As to how you date , it depends on your culture . In the US , you ask her to go to dinner and a movie . Meet her parents , make polite conversation for 5 - 10 minutes , tell them when you will be home.Feeling comfortable is a matter of not pushing . Do n't try to [ hold hands / kiss / have sex ] on the first night , for instance , again depending on your culture . Ask her about her interests instead of talking about yours.Depending on your age and experience , she will probably be as nervous or not nervous as you . Two 16-year olds are ALWAYS nervous . A 40-year old divorced man and a 40-year old widow should be less nervous ; they have seen more of life .

"How to protect yourself from the pain of love ? I avoided him for weeks because I just did n't feel an instant attraction or any chemistry . He was persistent and somehow broke through the brick wall . I fell for him and fell hard . He was everything I 'd asked God for - a Christian , strong , handsome , loving , caring and put me on a pedestal . I treated him like a prince , respected him , but held him accountable in the areas where he struggled ( something he said he wanted ) . Just when life could n't get any better , he decided that God was telling him to go back to his ex who treats him like crud . The joy was indescribable , but so is the pain ... and honestly , even moreso . I do n't think the chance of true love is worth the pain of rejection . How does one protect themselves from pain of this sort without isolating everyone and turning into the lonliest person in the world ? The pain of rejection is temporary . You feel it now because the wound is fresh . But wounds always get better with time . However bad it has been losing this guy for you , you will surely get over it . Because , pain is always temporary.Whereas , the joy of true love , when you do find it , is permanent . It is an eternal paradise . You have already had a glimpse of it . Just imagine how wonderful it would be if such a joy lasted forever . So dont think the pain is not worth bearing . It is . Not just once or twice but as many times it takes . Never lose faith in true love . Just because one person struck hollow , doesnt mean every other guy will . The only way to be happy is to believe that there is good and happiness and it is attainable.There is no way you can protect yourself from this sort of pain . It is a part of life . But so is the happiness . Someday it will be yours . All you have to do is hang in there , especially during the delicates moments like the ones you 're going through now . Dont lose hope.. the world is a beautiful garden with many wonderful flowers.You 'll find your rose . Time is all it takes .",0

"A possible cause of terrorism ? I 've watched several muslim men with their young sons . Every one of them allowed their sons to do anything they wanted . There was no guidance whatsoever . When the mother would try to check the son 's activities , to tell him no , the child ignored her , because he knew that the father would not back her up . Are the three fathers I 've noticed indicative of the greater percentage of mulim parenting ?

I would love to get paid for helping other drivers get loads . But the stock seems volatile and I do n't have money to lose . Thx . I would stay away from penny stocks . This stock is at a 52 week low for a reason . Also , penny stocks can be manipulated easily with pump and dump schemes.You 're better off putting your money in other transportation stocks like JB HUNT or Fed Ex .

Theres this really nice girl i met at skul , n ive gotten to kno her these past few months , n ive fallen completly for her , n her b-day is comin up , so i want to buy her a nice present..which one do u think she 'll like more ? The difference between yellow gold or white gold ( or silver ) is colour . There is not too much difference between white gold , silver , or platinum for that matter . It all comes down to price and prestige . The more you spend , the easier to show off with pride.Of course , the best place to start is in her own jewellery collection . Some people do n't like the look of yellow gold on themselves . Others say the same of silver . If you do n't have access to her jewellery collection , look at what she wears on a regular basis . Buy something that will match a piece she already wears.Do n't forget that you can add semi-precious gemstones to jewellery to add to its sparkle and visual appeal . See sources for jewellery of this type .",0

"what is the begining of israel and palastine conflict ? why could n't it be stopped ? Complex problems usually do n't have simple answers ( like 'they tried to throw the Palestinians out ) .For over 3,000 years , Jews have held the Land of Israel to be their homeland , both as a Holy Land and as a Promised Land . The Land of Israel holds a special place in Jewish religious obligations , encompassing Judaism 's most important sites — including the remains of the First and Second Temple , as well as the rites concerning those temples . [ 2 ] Starting around 1200 BCE , a series of Jewish kingdoms and states existed intermittently in the region for over a millennium . Recent archeological evidence suggests that the kingdoms of King David and King Solomon may have existed . [ 3 ] Under Babylonian , Greek , Roman , Byzantine , and ( briefly ) Sassanian rule , Jewish presence in the province dwindled due to mass expulsions . In particular , the failure of the Bar Kochba Revolt against the Roman Empire resulted in widescale expulsion of Jews . It was during this time that the Romans gave the name Syria Palaestina to the geographic area , in an attempt to erase Jewish ties to the land . The Mishnah and Jerusalem Talmud , two of Judaism 's most important religious texts , were composed in the region during this period . The Arabs conquered the land from the Eastern Roman Empire in 638 CE . The area was ruled by various Arab states ( interrupted by the rule of the Crusaders ) before becoming part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517.Throughout the centuries , the size of the Jewish population in the land fluctuated widely . Circa 1881 , in the region approximating present-day Israel , the Jewish population numbered approximately 20–25,000 of a total population of 470,000 . [ citation needed ] Since 1844 , in Jerusalem the Jews have constituted the largest of several ethno-religious groups . [ citation needed ] By 1896 , they were an absolute majority of the populationThe rise of Nazism in 1933 led to a fifth wave of Aliyah . The Jews in the region increased from 11 % of the population in 1922 to 30 % by 1940 . The subsequent Holocaust in Europe led to additional immigration from other parts of Europe . By the end of World War II , the number of Jews in Palestine was approximately 600,000.In 1939 , the British abandoned the idea of a Jewish national home , and abandoned partition and negotiations in favour of the White Paper of 1939 , which limited Jewish immigration and restricted purchase of land by Jews . Its other stated policy was to establish a system under which both Jews and Arabs were to share one government . The plan was never fully implemented because of a combination of resistance from the Jews and Arabs and Britain 's pre-occupation with Europe and World War II . However , the White Paper guided British policy until the end of the term of their Mandate . As a result , many Jews fleeing to Palestine to avoid Nazi persecution and the holocaust were intercepted and returned to Europe . Two specific examples of this policy involved the ships Struma and Exodus [ 4 ] . These attempts by Jews to circumvent the blockade and flee Europe became known as Aliya Beth.In 1947 , following increasing levels of violence by militant groups together with unsuccessful efforts to reconcile the Jewish and Arab populations , the British government decided to withdraw from the Palestine Mandate . The UN General Assembly approved the 1947 UN Partition Plan dividing the territory into two states , Jewish and Arab , giving about half the land area to each state . Jerusalem was planned to be an international region administered by the UN to avoid conflict over its status.Immediately following the adoption of the Partition Plan by the UN General Assembly ( on November 29 , 1947 ) , the Arab leadership rejected the plan and launched a guerilla war that included attacks on Jewish civilians . The Irgun Tsvai Leumi retaliated with attacks on Arabs , including Arab civilians.On May 14 , 1948 , before the expiry of the British Mandate of Palestine at midnight of May 15 , 1948 ,",0
"Fibromyalgia ? Help ? ? ? ? 15 yr old with severe fibromyalgia ... any tips ? Find answers to these issues and you will live with less pain More effective , guilt-free communications with family and friends about symptoms Avoiding frustrations at the doctor 's office , which may range from discussing symptoms to requesting specific therapies Handling demands on limited time Keeping up with job duties or household tasks without causing a flare-up Striving for and maintaining a better quality of life—one that makes you both happier and healthier How to respond to hurtful comments from others TreatmentIn general , treatment for fibromyalgia is with a combination of medication and self-care . The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health.MedicationsMedications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep . The ones most commonly recommended by doctors include : Analgesics . Over-the-counter acetaminophen ( Tylenol , others ) may ease the pain and stiffness caused by fibromyalgia . However , its effectiveness varies with individuals . Tramadol ( Ultram ) is a prescription pain reliever that may be taken with or without acetaminophen . Your doctor may have you take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) — such as aspirin , ibuprofen ( Advil , Motrin , others ) or naproxen sodium ( Anaprox , Aleve ) — in conjunction with other medications , but NSAIDs have n't proven to be effective in managing the pain in fibromyalgia when taken by themselves . Antidepressants . Your doctor may prescribe antidepressant medications , such as amitriptyline , nortriptyline ( Aventyl , Pamelor ) or doxepin ( Sinequan ) to help promote sleep . Fluoxetine ( Prozac ) in combination with amitriptyline has also been found effective . Sertraline ( Zoloft ) and paroxetine ( Paxil ) also are effective if you 're suffering from depression . These medications may be beneficial by affecting serotonin levels in the brain . Muscle relaxants . Taking the medication cyclobenzaprine ( Flexeril ) at bedtime may help treat muscle pain and spasms . Benzodiazepines . These drugs may help relax muscles and promote sleep . Usually , doctors avoid benzodiazepines in treating fibromyalgia because they have n't been shown to have long-term benefit and have the potential for drug dependence . Prescription sleeping pills , such as zolpidem ( Ambien ) , may provide short-term benefits for some people with fibromyalgia , but doctors usually advise against long-term use of these drugs . These medications tend to work for only a short time , after which your body becomes resistant to their effects . Ultimately , using sleeping pills tends to create even more sleeping problems in many people.Doctors do n't usually recommend narcotics for treating fibromyalgia because of the potential for dependence and addiction . Corticosteroids , such as prednisone , have n't been shown to be effective in treating fibromyalgia.Cognitive-behavioral therapyCognitive-behavioral therapy seeks to increase your belief in your own abilities and teaches you methods for dealing with stressful situations . Therapy can be provided via individual counseling , audiotapes or classes , and may help you manage your fibromyalgia.Treatment programsInterdisciplinary treatment programs may be effective in improving your symptoms , including relieving pain . These programs can combine a variety of treatments , such as relaxation techniques , biofeedback and receiving information about chronic pain . There is n't one combination that works best for everybody . Your doctor can create a program based on what works best for you . Self-careSelf-care is critical in the management of fibromyalgia . Important aspects of self-care include taking these actions : Reduce stress . Develop a plan to avoid or limit overexertion and emotional stress . Allow yourself time each day to relax . That may mean learning how to say no without guilt . But do n't change your routine totally . People who quit work or drop all activity tend to do worse than those who",0

"What is the wicca religon ? I have always wondered . Wicca is a Neopagan religious movement found in many different countries , though most commonly in English-speaking cultures . Wicca was first publicised in 1954 after the repeal of the British Witchcraft Act , by a British civil servant named Gerald Gardner . He claimed that the religion , of which he was an initiate , was a modern survival of an old witch cult , which had existed in secret for hundreds of years , originating in the pre-Christian Paganism of Europe . Wicca is thus sometimes referred to as the Old Religion . The veracity of Gardner 's claims is now much debated , and it is thought that much if not all of Wiccan theology was established no earlier than the 1920s . Since its founding , various related Wiccan traditions have evolved , or been adapted from , the form established by Gardner , which came to be called Gardnerian Wicca . These other traditions of Wicca each have specific beliefs , rituals , and practices . Most traditions of Wicca remain secretive and require members to be initiated , however there is a growing movement of Eclectic or Solitary Wiccans who adhere to the religion but do not believe a traditional initiation is necessary . Gardnerian Wicca is perhaps the most popular of the traditions excepting Solitary Wicca . you can find more information also in the address that i give you",0

This is serious . He 's seriously addicted I 've been battling this addiction for years myself . It is not an easy thing to kick !

What I mean is realize he is acting on very normal impulses , but seeking relief in unhealthy ways . If you make him feel guilty about it , it 'll only compound the problem.2 . Get him to agree to be held accountable for his actions . If you are his wife/partner , encourage him to talk to you or someone else he trusts whenever he feels he can not resist the temptation.3 . Get him to seek spiritual help . I am a born again believer in the Lord Jesus Christ . It 's only by His strength I can and will overcome this addiction ! 4 . Encourage him to take it a day at a time ( a minute at a time if necessary ) .5 . If he stumbles , encourage him to confess it , ask forgiveness from God , and get back on the wagon ( knowing he 's been forgiven ) .6 . NEVER give up on him ! And do your best not to allow him to give up on himself.There may come a point where there 's nothing more that you can do for this man ( save pray for him ) . If that time comes , do n't be afraid to leave him in God 's capable , loving hands . You ca n't heal him , but God is eager and well able to do just that ! I , on my part will endeavor to pray for you and your friend as I 'm reminded to do so . If I can help you further , drop me an email .",0

"any lawers in here ? My husband had lukemia when he was little . His father worked at a papermill . I have done research on the papermill and they do have benzene products . I know that it is possible for benzene to cling to clothing and induce lukemia . The problem is his lukemia has been gone for 20+ years and the statute of limitations apply . He has not been in for a check up nor has he ask a health professional if this could be possible . If he gets documentation stateing that it was indeed possible that the exposure may have caused his lukemia , could we sue for `` delayed discovery ? '' Sometimes the accrual of a cause of action in tort is delayed until the plaintiff discovered ( or reasonably should have discovered or suspected ) the factual basis for his or her claim . The discovery rule most frequently applies when it is particularly difficult for the plaintiff to observe or understand the breach of duty , or when the injury itself ( or its cause ) is hidden or beyond what the ordinary person could be expected to understand.Unfortunately , you did not specify where you live . Statutes and case law vary by , so there may literally be 50 different ways to answer your question . There might even be federal laws that apply . Your best bet is to consult a local attorney familar with tort law and get more specific advice .",0

"why was u.s.s.r.'seconomy having proplems under communism ? I lived in Moscow in 1992 for five months ... one of the vestiges of the communist system was the local food-staple ( milk , sugar , eggs and four ) market . Part of the system was to create jobs for all-To buy anything from this market you had to stand in an hour-long line to get a ticket that represented an item like a bag of flour , then you had to stand in an hour-long line to pay for what the tickets represented , then you had to go into another hour-long line to pick up the items you paid for , and finally you had to wait in an hour-long line for them to check your purchases against the reciepts and tickets . Four hours to buy milk and eggs- assuming you know exactly what you want.In a word , the economy was suffering from gross `` inefficiency '' that made profitability impossible . The inefficiencies came from govt . corruption and the notion that everyone should have a job ( even if the work is meaningless like it was in the market ) . Because it almost always cost more to produce than the benefit of production , the govt . borrowed heavily to support it 's programs ( which included almost all business because the govt . `` nationalized '' meaning they owned almost all of them ) leading to massive inflation and the eventual implosion of its economy .",0

"What is the holyghost ? Holy Ghost is a play by Dr. Jon Tuttle , Playwright-in-Residence and Literary Manager at Trustus Theatre in Columbia , South Carolina , and Professor of English at Francis Marion University .

It is set in 1944 , in a camp in South Carolina for German prisoners-of-war , overseen by black guards who enjoy few of the liberties the prisoners do . While there , the prisoners are subjected to a secret governmental re-education program which , ironically , resembles Goebbels ' Nazi propaganda . One prisoner escapes , equipped only with the lines he ’ s learned playing the lead in a camp production of Abe Lincoln in Illinois , and chased by a black private who sees the pursuit as a quest for acceptance . Their dash across the American South explores the ironies and hypocrisies of the American mythos .",0

"How do I raise my credit score fast and without paying some company to erase stuff off my report ? Basic but effective tequniques or tricks if you know them . If someone asks you for money to increase your score , it is true that they are likely to be a thief , however , it is NOT TRUE that you can not raise your score . Your credit score is primarily affected by a few things . First , any time that you make a late payment , even one that is only 30 days late , that will effect your score as much as 50 points the first month . It will climb slowly each month thereafter if you pay on time . So , do n't ever pay late . Secondly , a large part of your score is determined by the ratio of credit used to credit available . If you have a $ 1,000 limit on your card , DO NOT leave a balance on that card of over $ 500 . The lower your credit debt to credit limits , the better your score will be . Lastly , the longer you have credit , the better . Some people will cancel cards and accounts that are infrequently used . Do n't do that ! Leave them open . On the other hand , having too many credit accounts means you are a credit hog . Every time you apply for credit , your score will go down , for a few months .",0

"What is a PIC ( ? ) tube or insert ? My brother starts Chemo & radiation next week and they set up his feeding tube for when he needs it down the line . PIC stands for percutaneous intravenous catheter . Sometimes it is necessary to receive medicine or other fluids intravenously ( in the vein ) . If it is needed for a long period of time , the doctor might consider a PIC line as the best option . PIC lines are long , flexible tubes inserted into a large vein , usually near the elbow . The tube ( medically speaking , all tubes are called catheters ) is threaded up the vein until its tip reaches the large veins inside the chest.A PIC line can remain in place for several weeks or more . They are especially helpful for patients who need to receive medication at home for a long time . It is not uncomfortable . Most people have no trouble with them , and they can remain quite active while having one in place . PIC lines have bandages which are placed over the insertion site to make sure it does n't get accidentally tugged . This bandage has to be changed every day or two . A PIC line can be used for several kinds of injections , therefore , the patient does not have to be poked so many times .",0

If the library does not have the ordinances , you 'll have to contact city hall at 4982 Highway 53 , 706-654-3915 , for details on where to obtain the ordinances . The Braselton Public Library , or perhaps a larger library like the county or a university library , should also have the Georgia Annotated Statutes , where you can compare and contrast the Braselton ordinances with the Georige code . I hope this helps .",0
"Can I have a unique command that backs up XP +programs and data separately and allows restoring them separatel Windows XP and programs are set up and uploaded little by little . After a certain period of time it has become impossible to redo it exactly the same way ... unfortunately this is generally the moment for the big crash . Does somebody know a good way to restart with a simple `` one button command '' ? Many thanks to who will give me a quick and simple solution I use a program called norton ghost , When I got my new laptop for Christmas , the first thing that I did was to put the laptop the exact way I wanted it , then back it up . With norton ghost it allows you to create a boot cd that will install your stuff to your computer , essentially reverting your hard drive to that point . You will still have to run backups of your data that you create , but Ghost will be able to schedule that so that it is essentially a set and forget backup policy .",0

"Hi there , Does anyone have advice for people considering starting a relationship with somebody with Herpes ? I am having a difficult time getting comfortable with the fact that my girlfriend has HSV I and II ( and I do not ) . I am afraid , knowing that if I choose to stay in this relationship , I will eventually end up getting it as well ... and there is no way to know how my body will react to the virus ' . Right now I am viewing the virus as a magnifying glass that makes small concerns seem like larger ones , because it is a huge commitment just to try to see if the relationship will be successful . The relationship would already have more than normal amounts of stressors because of geographical issues ( I 'd have to move a long distance to be with her ) and other reasons . We have been doing the long-distance dating which is great , but distance makes the heart grow fonder as well . I feel like a very bad person for having these feelings , but I 'm trying to get a grasp on things , so please help if you have any insights . being educated on these things is best.. and knowing the risks .

"Will someday the idea of human cloning will be legal ? Right now , it 's just an idea . But who knows in the future suddenly we found someone that looks very identical to us like our twin ! There is too much movie out there that depict this phenom , is n't it ? So how we can sure that this is not possible to be legal in the future ? Hi there , You are absolutely right . It is likely that Human Cloning will be accepted in the future . Just think of it ... Would n't it be wonderful to clone persons like Einstein , Socrates , and other great people who have influenced this world ? But I think there must be restrictions on whom to clone . If not , the population of this world will rise rapidly . Also , it will give rise to unnecessary chaos and disorder regarding who is who . And I also think the technology should be known to a limited number of scientists , because there is a likely chance of illegal cloning ( as in the movie 'The Sixth Day ' ) If every person gets to know the technology , he can take the creation into his own hands , and so all the unethical things are likely to happen . So , on the whole , Human Cloning is n't a bad idea , provided there are 'proper ' laws made and 'implemented ' , and people think rationally.rule wid style n luv @ vinnyEdit : Well , I do agree with you that a lot depends on the society and the brought-up of the person , but I was just trying to bring out a point there .

"8 couples I know are currently pregnant with twins . What 's going on ? What is causing this ? Well , unless the couples you know got pregnant thanks to the help of fertility drugs , I 'd say it 's just a coincidence . Twins run in some families . I 'm assuming you 're wondering whether twins is an increasing trend , and not literally what causes twins ( either two eggs getting fertilized at the same time , or one fertilized egg splits into two ) . Also , when a woman gets into her later 30s , twins are more common . The chances of having twins also goes up if you 've had children before.Sounds like your friends are going to have enough kids to form their own football league ! : )",0
"am i at risk for std ? Hi , I have a concern and I was hoping that some of you might be able to help me . Last night my girlfriend came over to my house and we had unprotected vaginal sex . It was her first time ( meaning she was a virgin ) . There was no blood or anything like that at all . This is the first time that I have had unprotected sex . We didnt perform any oral sex though last night but we have in the past few weeks . I just wanted to know , if it 's possible that I caught anything ( even though she was a virgin ) . STD or HIV ? one last note : A girl performed oral sex on me last december ( early december ) . Does that influence anything ? Thank you in advance If your girl is a virgin and she has not been infected by any STD by sharing needles or bad blood transfusion you 're not going to catch anything from her.You can receive an STD by Salival transmission so if the girl who went down on you has an STD you may have received it.Remember that life is an STD . If you 're having unprotected vaginal sex you need to make sure you are at a point in your life where you 'll be able to support a child . If you 're not then you should take every precaution against pregnancy . Remember that the only method that is 100 % effective is abstinence ( well and oral I guess ) .",0

"name the us possessions and territories ? A History of United States Insular Areas : How the Relationships Began From 1899 to 1941 , Guam was under U.S . Naval Administration . At the outbreak of World War II , the Japanese seized Guam and occupied the island for two and a half years . American forces recaptured Guam in July 1944 , and the U.S . Naval Administration resumed responsibility when peace returned.In 1950 , the U.S. Government enacted the Guam Organic Act , conferring U.S. citizenship on the people of Guam and establishing local self-government . Under the Organic Act of 1950 , the Secretary of the Interior assumed administrative responsibility for Guam , formerly vested in the Secretary of the Navy.The United States purchased the Virgin Islands for $ 25 million from Denmark in 1917 . The Virgin Islands were placed under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy until they were transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1931.Interior 's relationship with other U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands stemmed from a post-World War II trusteeship . The Northern Mariana Islands , the Marshall , Palau , Yap , Kosrae , Chuuk and Pohnpei Islands were grouped into the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands ( TTPI ) by the United Nations in 1947 . Under the Trusteeship Agreement with the U.N. Security Council , the United States exercised administrative jurisdiction over the TTPI.The Navy administered the TTPI until 1951 , when that authority was given to the Secretary of the Interior . During those initial years of authority , the Secretary of the Interior exercised broad administrative authority in all the insular areas . Chief executives of the insular governments were appointees of the President or the Secretary and the Secretary had the legal authority to supervise and give binding directions to them.However , this is no longer the case . Popularly elected legislatures ( Guam-1950 , USVI-1954 , American Samoa-1961 , and the CNMI-1979 ) and governors ( Guam and USVI 1971 , American Samoa 1978 , the CNMI , 1979 ) were established . Each of the U.S. insular areas has become responsible for the administration of local government functions . Although the Congress has placed with the Secretary , certain continuing budget and program coordination authority and responsibility concerning U.S. insular affairs , the local governments are not entities of the Department , nor are they agencies or instrumentalities of the Federal Government.Except for CNMI , which became a commonwealth of the U.S. , the remaining TTPI entities chose a dramatically different political status.On May l , l979 , the United States recognized the Constitution of the Marshall Islands and the establishment of the Government of the Marshall Islands ( RMI ) . The United States recognized the Federated States of Micronesia ( FSM ) constitution in 1979 and establishment of the Government of the FSM , both national and state levels . FSM created the 4 State levels from the islands of Yap , Chuuk , Pohnpei and Kosrae.On October 1 , 1994 , the Compact of Free Association between the United States and Palau entered into force , ( U.S. Public Law 99-658 ) . The Compact entered into force for the Marshall Islands on October 2l , l986 , ( Presidential Proclamation No . 5564 ) . The FSM Compact was fully implemented on November 3 , 1986 ( Presidential Proclamation No . 5564 ) .Under the Compact , the status of free association recognizes each Freely Associated State as a sovereign state with the capacity to conduct foreign affairs consistent with the terms of the Compact . The Compact places full responsibility for defense with the United States . The Compact also provides grant funds and Federal program assistance , principally through the Department of the Interior.Under the Compact , the State Department is responsible for government-to-government relations , while Interior is responsible for the oversight and coordination of U.S. programs and funding assistance.District of ColumbiaAmerican SamoaGuamPuerto RicoNorthern Marianas",0

how can I heal a chronic broken heart ? it seems i will carry the pain for the rest of my life ? It took ten years for my poor poor heart to mend after I divorced my husband of 13 years b/c he had a baby with an aquaitance of mine and I felt sorry for her not being married and all gave her a baby shower and gave her all my childs things ( i did not know it was his child til later ) . It just takes time . I dove into my work and made new friends ( seeing as how all my old friends knew it was his child and did not tell me ) and spent some quality time with myself . I got to know me really well and decided I really liked the new me . Just give yourself time to heal and get involved with work and friends . It does help . Oh and try not to drown your sorrows in alchol and drugs . I tried that I lost everything I had AGAIN and had to start over . Good luck to you and try and hang in there the world has a lot to offer if you will just stop and look around . I am happily married now to a wonderful and caring man that adores me ! I am living proof that your heart can and will mend . I may stil be cracked but it will heal .,0
"At 29 years of age , is asking for a virgin wife too much to ask for ? She will not be the only one sharing. ? In marriage we men are supposed to be like Christ to his people . That means we are to be forgiving and willing to lay down our life for our spouse . I do n't see where it gives us the right to demand perfection of their past before they even met us . What if Christ had said , `` I will save only those who have been perfect , afterall I 'm going to the cross for them , is that too much to ask ? '' You are only going to the altar , so I would suggest you spend more time focusing on what kind of a husband you can be to her , rather than what has she saved for you ?

"what is ... ? What is Scienctology ( sp.. sorry ) I just recently heard that term used for a type of religion , I was courious to know if anyone new what it was or what it is about ... thanks Hi , here are a few detailsScientology is a system of beliefs , teachings and rituals , originally established as a secular philosophy in 1952 by science-fiction author L. Ron Hubbard , then recharacterized by him in 1953 as an `` applied religious philosophy . `` Scientology is officially represented by the controversial Church of Scientology . The Church presents itself as a non-profit religious organization dedicated to encouraging development of the human spirit . Providing counseling and rehabilitation programs , the Church offers itself as an alternative to psychiatry , which Scientologists believe to be a barbaric and corrupt profession . [ 1 ] ( http : //www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/heritage/pg011.html ) Church spokespeople attest that Hubbard 's teaching ( called `` technology '' or `` tech '' ) has freed them from drug and alcohol addictions , depression , learning disabilities , mental disorders and other problems.Scientology , however , has been the object of many allegations that sharply contradict the Church 's self-description . Critics—including officials and the courts of several countries—have characterized the Church of Scientology as an unscrupulous commercial organization ; it has often been described not as a religion , but a man-made cult that harasses its critics and exploits its members . Many of the Church 's most controversial actions are , critics argue , a direct reflection of Hubbard 's Scientology teachings.Origins of ScientologyScientology was expanded and reworked from Dianetics [ 2 ] ( http : //www.neuereligion.de/ENG/Wolf/pg6.htm ) , an earlier system of self-improvement techniques originally set out by Hubbard in the 1950 book , Dianetics : The Modern Science of Mental Health . Immediately prior to this work , Hubbard was intensively involved with the occultist Jack Parsons in performing the occult rites developed by Aleister Crowley . Some critics have seen many similarities in Hubbard 's writings to the doctrines of Crowley [ 3 ] ( http : //www.xenu.net/archive/lrhbare/lrhbare08.html ) .By the mid-1950s , Hubbard had relegated Dianetics to being a sub-study of Scientology , although it is still promoted and delivered by Scientology organizations . The chief difference between the two is that Dianetics is explicitly secular , focused on the individual 's present life and dealing with physical and mental or emotional problems , whereas Scientology adopts a more overtly religious approach [ 4 ] ( http : //victorian.fortunecity.com/finsbury/124/last.htm ) focused on dealing with spiritual issues spanning multiple past lives as well as the present day.Hubbard was repeatedly accused of adopting a religious facade for Scientology in order for the organization to maintain tax-exempt status and avoid prosecution for false medical claims ; these accusations have dogged the Church of Scientology to the present day , bolstered by numerous accounts from Hubbard 's fellow science-fiction authors that on various occasions he stated that the way to get rich was to start a religion [ 5 ] ( http : //www.bible.ca/scientology-1million-start-a-religion.htm ) .The word scientology has a history of its own . Although nowadays associated almost exclusively with Hubbard 's work , it was coined by the philologist Alan Upward in 1907 as a synonym for `` pseudoscience '' . [ 6 ] ( http : //www.instinct.org/texts/bluesky/bs3-4.htm ) In 1934 , the Argentine-German writer Anastasius Nordenholz published a book using the word positively : Scientologie , Wissenschaft von der Beschaffenheit und der Tauglichkeit des Wissens , or Scientology , Science of the Constitution and Usefulness of Knowledge . [ 7 ] ( http : //www.scientologie.de/scientologie/index.htm ) Nordenholz 's book is a study of consciousness , and its usage of the word is not greatly different from Hubbard 's definition , `` knowing how to know '' . However , it is not clear to what extent Hubbard was aware of these earlier usages . The word itself is",0

"what do you think about eurotrip ? I think Eurotrip is a great comedy and I take it like that - not to seriously . The fact is that it 's a lot misleading . Even though they travelled through the whole Europe , almost the entire movie has been shot in Prague , Czech Republic . But the worst thing was the part where they visited Slovak Republic and Bratislava . I come from Slovakia and the whole image of the country in Eurotrip was very insulting . It looked like the country is still in middle ages . And the fact that they lived in luxury and comfort for one or two dollars is a total bullshit . Bratislava is one of the most expensive cities in Central Europe and in the entire EU . For two dollars you would not even get a coffee in the downtown . And that kind of hotel they staid in would cost about $ 100 dollars per one night or more . My point is that when someone presents our country in such way it really hurts us since it 's miles from the truth . People should know what they are putting inside of the movie and be very careful with that since they are risking the whole public opinion on the country . Slovakia is a member of Europian Union with the fastest growing economy .

"what is html ? HTML A markup language used to structure text and multimedia documents and to set up hypertext links between documents , used extensively on the World Wide Web . ( Web sites are created using HTML ) HTML Itself Is Not a Programming LanguageHTML is a markup language ( the ML in HTML ) that uses a fixed set of markup tags . A markup language can also be thought of as a `` presentation language , '' but it is not a programming language . You can not `` if this-do that '' like you can in Java , JavaScript or C++ . However , in order to make pages interactive , programming code can be embedded in an HTML page . For example , JavaScript is widely interspersed in Web pages ( HTML pages ) for that purpose .

"How long can a person live with with the full blown aids virus , also can they fight off the flu , common colds ? We do n't really use the term `` full blown AIDS '' anymore . Most often we look at T-cell counts . T-cells are in your blood . They are part of the immune system . They are what identify things that make you sick . HIV attacks T-cells and eventually kills them all off.We also look at something called a `` viral load . '' It simply tells how much of the virus is in your blood.The lower your T-cells are , and the higher your viral load is - the sicker you may become.If a person with AIDS takes their medications they can live a long and healthy life . I have known people with less than 10 T-cells who have been relatively healthy for a few years . There are medications that can prevent other types of infections that affect people with AIDS too.So , how long can you live ? No one really knows . With medications , people with AIDS can live long and healthy lives.For someone with a badly damaged immune system and not recieving medical care - a common cold or the flu can lead to other infections that eventually could kill the person .",0
"tips for auditions ? in class we are putting on a play , a midsummer nights dream and i want to get the part of helena . im pretty good at acting , if i know my part , i cant improvise , we have to try out for the parts we want . that kind of sucks for me , what are some tips that i can use ? I am a young actor as well . I highly recommend reading AUDITION by Michael Shurtleff . 1 . Speak at a good pace and be LOUD ( little to no chance of landing the part if they ca n't hear you ) 2 . Do n't memorize anything unless you have to . It will not impress the person casting if you can memorize something . Memorizing unnecessarily wastes energy on remembering when it could be used towards acting.3 . Be respectful and attentive to the auditor but DO NOT MAKE SMALL TALK WITH THE AUDITOR . They are there to work.4 . Get familiar with the play so you can be more prepared to accuratly portray your piece . 5 . Practice , Practice , Practice . Practice in front of people ( and get feedback ) , practice to a mirror.6 . If memorization is necessary , memorize it like the back of your hand . Once you get on stage and the adrenaline starts pumping , it 's easier to forget.7 . RELAX , the auditor is not out to get you .",0
"How do you make a USB drive bootable ? I have a Sony Micro Vault 256MB HDD ( the stick kind that plugs into the USB port ) I want to make this bootable so I can use it to dump pre-built images using ghost . I need to know how to get it to format with the system info so I can boot directly from the device . Your BIOS must support booting from USB devices . On system startup you need to get into your BIOS ( usually F2 - check manufacturer 's specification ) , and find where you can specify the boot order . Select a low-numbered boot order item , and set it to USB-HDD ( if availble , otherwise another USB option ) . This may require several attempts until the right device option is found.Since most USB drives are ATAPI-compliant , your BIOS should detect it as if it were an external USB hard drive.Just make sure you specify a boot order BEFORE your internal hard drive ( usually HDD , or IDE0 ) , otherwise your system will always boot to the hard drive.Also , you need to format the USB drive as a bootable drive . If you can get the system to boot from a DOS , Windows or Linux floppy disk , you can try installing DOS , Windows 95/98 , or Linux ( Win2000 , and WinXP require more than 256Mb for sytem files ) . Your system will likely assign the USB drive as the C : & # 92 ; drive ( MAKE SURE THIS IS THE CASE BEFORE FORMATTING ! ! ! ) .Keep in mind that most USB drives are slower than hard drives , so performance may not be up to par . The newer `` high-speed '' drives are faster , but not comparable to a real hard drive.If no options work , your Micro Valut may not be ATAPI-compliant , or it 's USB-HDD firmware may not be compatible with your system . I had this happen with a SanDisk Cruzer mini , but a PNY Attache worked.If I may make one suggestion as well ... make a bootable CD with your images instead . CD 's are much more rugged , and can not be accidentally erased . Duplicates are EXTREMELY cheaper ( about 5 cents vs. $ 20 ) than the USB drive solution . Many more BIOS ' support booting from CD ( for about 10 years now ) , so compatibility is usually not an issue . All of the commercial CD-burning packages ( including most of the LITE versions ) support making bootable CD 's . The only trick is to make a bootable floppy that it can use to create the boot image on the CD .",0

"Is there a dallas bias ? Do the Dallas Cowboys have a bias against them with the media in the rest of the country ? I do n't think that a bias necessarily exists within the media , but among fans I believe there sure are a lot of Cowboys haters . There are several reasons for this . For one , there is a little bit of jealousy for `` America 's Team '' . These feelings are still carrying over from their dynasty in the 90 's ( and even the 70s ) . Also , the organization has had many abrasive characters : owner Jerry Jones , the Tuna , ex-stars such as Michael Irvin , and the myriad of criminals and druggies they 've paraded through in the last 10/15 years . As with any great sports organization , fans are very polarized ... you either love 'em or hate 'em . I love 'em , but conversely I despise great competing teams such as the Steelers and 49ers . Some in the media may have their beef with Jerry Jones or other people in the organization , but I think the strong anti-Dallas emotion is mainly among the fans ( which is a tribute to the Cowboys being one of the top teams in the sport ) .",0

There are several steps involved in getting a signal from the source , the sensory nerve ending , to the brain . The system of communication is so complex in the nervous system , it is hard to track exactly how the signal progresses through the body . Where the signal starts is unclear , because it can not start at the nerve ending .",0

"Is something wrong with YAHOO Fantasy sports ? ? I am not sure what exactly you mean . If you mean technical problems ? well sometimes the log in page doesn ' load and I have to refresh the page a few times . That seems to be a Yahoo problem in generalif you mean the game itself , it is generally good but I would suggest some improvements.1- the number one improvement that is absolutely necessary is the IR/IL lists . Sometimes other website report that certain players , eg . Ed Jovonavski or Amare Stoudomire have been put on the IR . Yahoo however , does n't follow suit immidiately , they are a few days late . They have to keep in mind that those few days are very important for some of us . 2- KEPPER LEAGUE OPTION : I play Keeper leagues , meaning that I have inherited a team and its minor league system ( in case of hockey ) . I get to trade draft picks , prospects and active players . I think it would be better if Yahoo had a keeper league option . a ) That way we would n't have to set up a new league every season . b ) I 'd also suggest that they have a minor league section as part of this keeper league option . We could then keep our prospects who are not yet part of the NHL on our minor league roster . That way no other GM accidentally picks these guys up and also we wo n't forget about one of our many prospects . c ) When trades occure , they need to announce to the other GM 's all parts of the trade . As you know , when you trade in Yahoo leagues , it also gives the GM an comment box in which people that play keeper leagues put names of prospects or draft picks . As it 's currently set , these comments do n't appear to the other GM 's when the trade is accepted . For us the active players that are exchanged is one thing , most of the time it 's the draft picks and prospects that are the real deal makers . Right now GMs have to post extra comments letting everyone else know of the trade . IMO that needs to change.that 's it for now till I think of other things .",0

"How are North and South America considered one continent , but Europe and Asia are considered seperate ? This question ( http : //answers.yahoo.com/question/index ? qid=1006020706083 ) inspired my question . I was always taught that there are seven continents . I personally would consider Eurpoe and Asia to be united before I would ever consider North and South America to be united . If you think otherwise ( or if you agree with me ) , please explain your answer . All 7 continents were joined together billions of years ago . However through time , they gradually split up , resulting in North and South America , and Australia to be separate from the main body-Europe , Asia and Africa.I figured because Europe and Asia had different coloured people which each had their unique tradition and customs . As they ruled differently due to customs , tradition and prctices , they probably decided to each govern their own way and thus they spilt up into 'different continents ' , though Europe and Asia are on the same piece of land .",0
"why did terry bradshaw not appear with the mvp 's in the super bowl ? When the NFL unveiled its MVPs from the previous 39 Super Bowls , only three living members skipped the ceremony.Former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana and former Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw decided to stay home , while former Dolphins MVP Jake Scott was traveling in Australia.Montana , the league 's only three-time Super Bowl MVP , and Bradshaw reportedly turned down the invitation over money.Both denied the reports.In a phone interview with ESPN2 's Cold Pizza on Monday night , Montana vehemently denied forgoing the ceremony over money and reiterated that his absence was due to his preference to see his son 's basketball game.He 'd told Cold Pizza last week he was n't going to be at the game because his son had an important basketball game he wanted to attend . Bradshaw , according to the Chronicle , told league officials he wanted to be with his family.Montana said money was never an issue and that he would not have attended the Super Bowl ceremony even if the appearance fee had been greater than the $ 100,000 he was reported to have requested.Former MVPs were given $ 1,000 for incidental expenses while in Detroit , along with other amenities such as plane tickets , car rental and game tickets.Sources told each paper that Montana asked for a guarantee of at least $ 100,000 in appearance money.When the league balked at Montana 's demands , the quarterback declined to be in attendance .",0

"When did Standard Amnerican English evolve ? When did `` American English '' become the standard ? What `` English '' did the Founding Fathers speak ? ( British , American , a mixture ? ) Different dialects of English have different standards . Standard American English is the standard for many Americans , but British people have a different standard , and so forth . So American English is n't really the standard for everyone ( although it is for many if they have economic or cultural ties to the United States ) .As for how the standard evolved , there have always been standards . In general , the dialect of whoever 's in power is considered the standard , because people want to be like that powerful group . Americans who are trying to speak Standard American English do so because they think it will give them social power . What 's interesting , though , is that Standard American English is just agreed upon as the standard by many Americans even though it does n't belong to a particular region.The Founding Fathers spoke a dialect that is different from either American dialects or British dialects today . They were British , but in the meantime English has evolved in both places .",0

"what makes a man sexy ? , To women please ? please list most important . Appearance : a fit body , very nice clothes , a little cologne , glasses , fuzzy or clean cut.. ? Demeanor : confident , shy , funny , wit humility ? thnks- man without a clue . Appearance : well-groomed , clean-smelling/light cologne , and well dressed . Whether bearded or shaved , long hair or short , being well-groomed ( clean hair and skin , well-trimmed facial hair ) is probably the most important . Well-dressed does n't necessarily mean expensive clothes , but clean , stain-free , and wrinkle-free is important.Demeanor : Confident , witty , humble are all good characteristics.However , there 's this certain way that some men naturally hold themselves that conveys sexuality like some kind of pheremone . It 's this casual , hip-slung sort of stance , accompanied by a direct gaze and a half-smile . Matthew Mcconnaughey has this posture . It sort of says `` I could take care of *all* your needs and have you begging for more ... '' I think most women get past the physical part of attraction fairly quickly . It 's important , but more important is what their guy is like . Not too sensitive ( no tears on the first date , please ! ) , but intuitive to their needs and the needs of those around them.Other than that , it depends on the woman and what she wants !",0

"How can we show the world that President Bush does'nt represent the american people. ? I Wont say that the president is doing a bad job , because I dont understand the reasons why he does the things he does , and I hav'nt studied the issues he is dealing with , but I cant feel good about starting a war in Iraq , bombing Pakistan when we 're not at war with them , violating our civil rights , the temporary concentration camp in the superdome after katrina ... etc . But I worry about what people in other countries think about Americans when he speaks for us with that dumb redneck voice . He was not elected by the majority of Americans . We chose Al Gore . The supreme court appointed him president . In the 2004 election he did'nt win any primary elections . The repulicans did'nt let anyone challenge him . They made believe they were democrats and voted for Kerry , and the democrats were saddled with an unelectable candidate . Then they put a gay marrige thing on the ballot so people would go to the polls to vote against that , and voted for the more anti gay candidate while they were there . In the 2000 election Gore won the popular vote , i.e . the majority voted for gore . In other countries you win if the majority votes for you . The foreigners dont believe that story about how Bush won because he got more of something called an electoral vote , especially since it happened in a state run by his brother . The election in Florida was done by computer , and everyone knows that a really good hacker can get into a computer and make it malfunction , so you know when theres something fishy going on with a computer , a hacker has made it past the firewall . Streamcat did'nt say concentration camp , he said temporary concentration camp , its a metaphor .

"what 's with the bermuda triangle ? The Bermuda Triangle is a stretch of the Atlantic Ocean bordered by a line from Florida to the islands of Bermuda , to Puerto Rico and then back to Florida . It is one of the biggest mysteries of our time - that is n't really a mystery . The term `` Bermuda Triangle '' was first used in an article written by Vincent H. Gaddis for Argosy magazine in 1964 . In the article Gaddis claimed that in this strange sea a number of ships and planes had disappeared without explanation . Gaddis was n't the first one to come to this conclusion , either . As early as 1952 George X. Sands , in a report in Fate magazine , noted what seemed like an unusually large number of strange accidents in that region . In 1969 John Wallace Spencer wrote a book called Limbo of the Lost specifically about the triangle and , two years later , a feature documentary on the subject , The Devil 's Triangle , was released . These , along with the bestseller The Bermuda Triangle , published in 1974 , permanently registered the legend of the `` Hoodoo Sea '' within popular culture . Several books suggested that the disappearances were due to an intelligent , technologically advanced race living in space or under the sea . The only problem was that the mystery was more hype than reality . In 1975 a librarian at Arizona State University , named Larry Kusche , decided to investigate the claims made by these articles and books . What he found he published in his own book entitled The Bermuda Triangle Mystery-Solved . Kusche had carefully dug into records other writers had neglected . He found that many of the strange accidents were not so strange after all . Often a triangle writer had noted a ship or plane had disappeared in `` calms seas '' when the record showed a raging storm had been in progress . Others said ships had `` mysteriously vanished '' when their remains had actually been found and the cause of their sinking explained . More significantly a check of Lloyd 's of London 's accident records by the editor of Fate in 1975 showed that the triangle was a no more dangerous part of the ocean than any other . U.S. Coast Guard records confirmed this and since that time no good arguments have ever been made to refute those statistics . So the Bermuda Triangle mystery disappeared , in the same way many of its supposed victims had vanished . Even though the Bermuda Triangle is n't a true mystery , this region of the sea certainly has had its share of marine tragedy . Perhaps the best known one was the story of Flight 19 . The tale of Flight 19 started on December 5th , 1945 . Five Avenger torpedo bombers lifted into the air from the Navel Air Station at Fort Lauderdale , Florida , at 2:10 in the afternoon . It was a routine practice mission and the flight was composed of all students except for the Commander , a Lt. Charles Taylor . The mission called for Taylor and his group of 13 men to fly due east 56 miles to Hens and Chicken Shoals to conduct practice bombing runs . When they had completed that objective , the flight plan called for them to fly an additional 67 miles east , then turn north for 73 miles and finally straight back to base , a distance of 120 miles . This course would take them on a triangular path over the sea . About an hour and a half after the flight had left , a Lt. Robert Cox picked up a radio transmission from Taylor . Taylor indicated that his compasses were not working , but he believed himself to be somewhere over the Florida Keys ( the Keys are a long chain of islands south of the Florida mainland ) . Cox urged him to fly north , toward Miami , if Taylor was sure the flight was over the Keys . Planes today have a number of ways that they can check their current position including listening to a set of GPS ( Global Positioning Satellites ) in orbit around the Earth . It is almost impossible for a pilot to get lost if he has the right equipment and uses it properly . In 1945 , though , planes flying over water had to depend on knowing their st",0

Neither is a great option and it 's a tough call so I think you got ta go with the guy who 's performed better so far this year which is Delhomme . You might want to check the waiver and see if somebody like McMahon - the new Philly QB is available as he 's got a nice matchup this week and could be better than your two current options .,0

"Why should things like language change just for the sake of new generations ? Case in point . Language may change for clarity and definition , such as the reason for thee , thou , thy and thine . Ok , you , your , and yours , which I still believe are acceptable for Worship , and religious expressions ; The Spanish Language uses that form for familiarity among personal relatives ; but did you know that the words `` blessed '' , `` doth '' `` knowest '' and `` thinketh '' can be related to a `` lisp tongue '' ie , . `` All I want for Chrithmath ith my two front teeth '' . Therefore a word like blessed would be pronouced `` Blethed '' and thinks `` thinkth '' or phonetically `` thinketh '' .My real point , however , is that most of todays language changes are perverse , gutteral , and obscene . As for traditions ; only the most valuable ones , based upon morality and righteousness , are becoming extinct.I ask you ; what do you say ? Language does n't change for the sake of a new generation . The change had already started generations before . Who came up with the obscenities in the first place ? Who decided that these sounds when put together to make words would be vulgar ? This is an interesting question . Your examples are interesting , also . I 'm not sure it is quite that simple . I 'm thinking that you would need a nation of people to lose their teeth permanently for at least a couple of generations for the new pronunciation to take effect .",0

That is God 's justice to mankind . He will let good people do good and the wicked do wickedness if they want because this way , God will be able to determine if His judgment is justified . He does not force anyone to believe Him nor He is a dictator . You can be whoever you want to be . And to the last question if these people are right . Definitely no . For believing that God is dead they are really putting shame on their faces . What made you believe there is no God or God is dead ? You just look at your face in the mirror , do you know how complex and complicated your face was engineered ? And that no one can do that only God can .",0

"If your kids do n't behave right is it approiate to spank them or slap them in the face ? It would take a supremely huge effort for me to EVER slap a kid in the face , however , I have to admit that I 've been tested a time or two . Spanking , however ... well , I am a firm believer in `` spare the rod , spoil the child '' . I am a bit older , however , I know that many people do not believe in this today.I will , then , share with you a family situation . I am the oldest of all of the grandkids & we are all now adults . I was spanked when necessary but not , of course , beaten in any way . My cousins , on the other hand , were never spanked or even smacked to save them from doing something stupid or harmful . My cousins , I have to admit , are some of the most spoiled & self-centered adults that I have EVER come across . Only one even approaches what I would consider normal & I think that this is only because she got lucky when she got married ... he makes a fortune & she does n't have to worry about anything other than taking care of their kids & shopping . Still , she 's quickly learning that she ca n't raise her kids the way she was raised . The other two ? All me , me , me ... to the extent that one of them expected her parents to help her finance en-vitro because she could n't have kids on her own . Now she has three that run wild ... while she blames everyone else for having to work so hard to support them.I know this is just my family but , geez , it should be a little snapshot into the adult effects of not spanking your children when they misbehave ... at least it has been for me ...",0

Check with the city of Layton to see if they offer a traffic class . In lieu of going to court , most cities will off you a Plea In Abeyance . It 's essentially entering a guilty plea , paying a reduced fine , and agreeing to go to traffic class . You will have to pay for the traffic class seperately from the ticket amount . If you take the class then the points do n't appear on your license . If you do n't take the class , then you have to pay the full amount of the ticket and the points will be put on your license . It 's annoying to get a ticket but the class is n't too painful and it helps to brush up on your driving knowledge . Good luck and happy driving !",0

"How did language start ? Especially the English language.. who define the ABCDE ... . Language predates the alphabet . The origins of Language are lost to the mists of time . The alphabet as we know it was developed by the Phonecians about 3000 years ago , and modified first by the Greeks , and then the Romans for their own languages before we adopted it from the Romans.The origins of the English language specifically date to sometime after 1066 when Willam the Conqueror became King of England . The commoners spoke something related to the ancestor language of Dutch while the nobility spoke French . We kept the grammar of the native Anglo-Saxon tongue while adding huge amounts of French vocabulary.The result is recognizably English , while still sounding very different from what we speak today . It 's not until Shakespear 's time that Modern English emerged .",0

What are some Web sites or good ways to burn fat fast ? Walking . Most people only utilize fat as an energy source at a particular level of exercise .

"My bad habit : chewing my fingers . What is the best way to stop it and break the habit ? I 've been chewing my fingers ever since I was in elementary . Nowadays , even at 20 - I occasionally chew on them when I get a little nervous or jittery , but I do n't even realize that . It 's getting a bit annoying and embarassing ... how do I stop it ? HMMMM some very interesting answers here that I like ... .Such as the rubber band idea . I would recomend that idea and see if that helps . If not ... .First of all as a former thumb sucker and smoker I understand oral fixations ( I quit the thumb thing a 12 started smoking at 13 and just quit that at 22 , about two months ago ) . Even now you will usually catch me with a touthpick , rubber band , bottle lid , pencils , or other item in my mouth . I have seriously cut back the habbit and consiously have to make efforts not to do it . Here are some suggestions . First of all peppers contain volitale oils that can chemically burn skin so avoid those . Purchase some alum powder and mix the powder with a few drops of water ( Enough to make a slightly runny paste . ) and soak your fingers in it . Alum is very , unpleasantly bitter and will immediately make your mouth pucker . Some people like lemon juice or tobasco so using those items usually does n't work because the taste is n't very strong . Next put up sticky notes at the places you are most like to do this . Repeating to yourself that this is bad trains your mind to avoid doing it subconsciously . If you are like me you also put your hand on your face ( or chin in hand , whatever ) . You can curb this action as well by improving your posture . Freeze yourself the next time you catch yourself doing this ( or finger chewing ) and analyze how you are sitting . Usually slumped with your elbow on the table or with your elbow semi supported by your stomach or chest . If you start improving your posture then you will become less inclined to hold your arm up unsupported for very long . I am using an exercise ball for a computer chair right now to retrain my posture . My doctor recomended it and I highly agree , I 've already noticed a difference.Cheer up though . Some studies say that finger chewing , nail biting , and other oral fixations are all signs of higher intelligence . It is believed that the brain in these cases works so fast that it actually gets bored or is somehow unstimulated . By controlling physical movement while mental processes such as reading or talking occur your brain is exercising itself and making you smarter and faster by training itself to multitask.Oh and a side note . Many people often notice that they chew nails/fingers in response to nervousness . The sucking/chewing motion is deeply ingrained in our most primitive side as being calming . When we are babies and we recieve food ( suckle ) subconciously we are aware of being protected by our mothers . The sucking/chewing motion along with full belly releases seratonin in the child inducing pleasure and happiness . In response to certain stresses adults will ocassionally do the same thing for the chemical calm it can induce , without even thinking about it . I tend to do this in the store especially when I ca n't find something . I feel lost and confused and tend to stick the tip of one or more finger in my mouth while looking .",0

"Are you really offended by swearing ? Do you think profanity is stupid ? I do , I think it is the most superstitious bullshit ever . “ Oh noes , I have said a ‘ bad ’ word , someone is automatically offended ! ” Ridiculous . Anyway , what are your opinions on swearing ? Is it really that bad ? Does it really make people feel uncomfortable or is it just another word in the dictionary ? Is it limiting our rights to freedom of speech to not be able to swear on the radio or in settings like schools ? I personally dont get offended by them because they were always my second language . I do however think they can make a person sound extremely unintelligent when they use them simply for shock value . I think that as we mature though , it does seem to make you cringe when people curse with every other word out of their mouth . I can have a pretty dirty mouth when I get angry , or when I smash my thumb with a hammer or something- but in everyday conversation , whats the point ? Is it to sound `` cool ? '' I remember I used to do it for that reason when I was like 8 , but when the thrill wore off- it just seemed like those words really didnt have any real purpose for being in my sentances , but I didnt get offended by them- more like turned off I guess.If I meet someone and we are just having a conversation , and profanity takes up most of their conversation , I just think they are ignorant for the most part . I am used to it though , so sometimes the profanity seems more natural in certain situations.Taking Gods name in vain though , I think that is absolutely offensive because it is against the religious beliefs of many , whether you understand it or not- it does offend a lot of people.by the way , tranced- you didnt offend me either , you just gave me a bad impression of you . Your comments are ignorant because the truth is , if everyone believed in Jesus there wouldnt be any arguments , so the world wouldnt be so messed up . Like it or not its true , because if everyone believed in something moral - no matter what it is- we would all agree on that morality . So , to show you the ignorance in your statement- it is ridiculous to blame Christians for the worlds troubles when the worlds troubles are rooted in things that go AGAINST Christian belief ! Sometimes a little reason- goes a long way , no matter what your beliefs are .",0

"What is a worm , trojan ? and how is it different from a computer virus ? Trojan horse is a malicious program that is disguised as legitimate software.A Trojan horse program has a useful and desired function , or at least it has the appearance of having such . In most cases the program performs other , undesired functions , but not always . The useful , or seemingly useful , functions serve as camouflage for these undesired functions . The kind of undesired functions are not part of the definition of a Trojan Horse ; they can be of any kind.In practice , Trojan Horses in the wild often contain spying functions ( such as a packet sniffer ) or backdoor functions that allow a computer , unbeknownst to the owner , to be remotely controlled from the network , creating a `` zombie computer '' . Because Trojan horses often have these harmful functions , there often arises the misunderstanding that such functions define a Trojan Horse.The basic difference from computer viruses is : a Trojan horse is technically a normal computer program and does not possess the means to spread itself . Originally Trojan horses were not designed to spread themselves . They relied on fooling people to allow the program to perform actions that they would otherwise not have voluntarily performed . Trojans of recent times also contain functions and strategies that enable their spreading . This moves them closer to the definition of computer viruses , and it becomes difficult to clearly distinguish such mixed programs between Trojan horses and viruses .",0

"What is the best way to get better abdominal muscles ? First and foremost , stay away from any ab machine.For the upper abs , focus on crunches which effectively work the abdominals better than sit-ups or any machine on the market.For the lower abs , keep in mind there is very little muscle tissue there so decreasing levels of body fat is the most effective way to bring out the best in this area .

"Why are people so obssesed with Howard Stern ? I admitt , he is entertaining to watch ... but why all the posts/questions about him ? It 's probably because of the huge media attention about Howard leaving terrestrial radio -- you know , traditional AM/FM radio stations -- in favor of satellite programming service Sirius . The deal is an enormous one ( reportedly $ 500 million ) and there is a tremendous amount of attention being paid to the change . His last day on traditional radio was today , and he will launch his satellite programs in about three weeks.Additonally , Howard is one of the greatest self-promoters around . He 's spent the past year since the deal was announced talking about his move , often on his terrestrial network show . It has created a lot of friction and , of course , more attention about Howard and his big move.I do n't know if his fans , or the public in general , are more obsessed with Howard now that he 's making this change . It will allow him to do whatever he wants , as opposed to the obscenity restrictions enforced on broadcast radio by the FCC . I think it 's some of both . While many of his fans ca n't wait for Howard to do literally anything , I think that a lot of hoopla is just all the hype . He 's a national figure getting this huge deal for what is essentially an unknown quantity in Sirius . There have been some real gains in their susbscriptions as they approach the launch , but whether they will bring in enough only time -- and Howard 's popularity -- will tell .",0

"Should I get a Master 's in Special Education or Public Policy ? I enjoy both fields . I currently have a bachelor 's in Finance , a field I 'm not too interested in.In the past I had a two year internship with my State Senator and a 1 year job as a special ed instructional assistant . I enjoyed both positions.Paying for it is not too much of a problem either as the state offers loan reimbursements for special ed teachers and the school of public policy is offering generous scholarships.So perhaps it comes down to job availability . There is definately a big need for special ed teachers . I do n't know how easy it is to get a legislative job however , although if it is possible I may really enjoy it.What do you think ? While public policy is an undoubedly exciting field , the rewards you 'll get and receive in special education are certainly among the most satisfying available.You have an opportunity to positively affect countless children and adults with challenges far beyond the average person . In the end , you have to follow your heart . I suggest searching it carefully to see what it holds for this field . The best of luck to you !",0

LOL at all the people who think that your debt disappears after 7 years . That 's just the limit as to how long it can hurt your credit .

"what is human relation in business psychology ? The human relations movement was initiated by psychologists and employment experts in the United States in the 1920s . The movement viewed workers in terms of their psychology and fit with companies , rather than as interchangeable parts.This view was advanced in reaction to the efficiency focus of Taylorism in the early 1900s . Though human resources have been part of business and organisations since the first days of agriculture , the modern concept of human resources was codified by advocates of a human relations view.This movement grew throughout the middle of the 20th century , placing emphasis on how leadership , cohesion , and loyalty played important roles in organizational success , and on the value of participatory management . Although this view was increasingly challenged by more quantitatively rigorous and less `` soft '' management techniques in the 1960s and beyond , human resources had gained a permanent role within the firm .",0

"any one know the reason why people say 'bless you ' after you sneeze ? I do it all the time and have no idea why . THIS IS THE ORIGIN OF THE CUSTOM : In English-speaking countries , it is common for at least one person to say `` Bless you '' after someone sneezes . The traditional explaination for the custom is that it began literally as a blessing . Pope Gregory I the Great ( 540-604 AD ) ascended to the Papacy just in time for the start of the plague in 590 AD ( his successor succumbed to it ) . To combat the plague Gregory ordered litanies , processions and unceasing prayer for God 's intercession . When someone sneezed , they were immediately blessed ( `` God bless you ! '' ) in the hope that they would not subsequently develop the plague.This custom persists among speakers of many languages . Common social responses to sneezes in English include `` Bless you '' and `` Gesundheit '' ( German , `` [ Good ] health [ to you ] '' ) .",0

"How do I know if my childs imagination is too extensive ? She is 3yrs old and has several imaginary friends , insists we feed her dolls our food at meals , and she is constantly making up stories about when she was older or a baby . I 'm beginning to think she 's losing touch with reality . While having an active imagination is no crime and certainly should n't alarm you as a parent , you might consider what these friends provide for your daughter . It seems like she has experienced some instability in life right now and if she is feeling detached from her father , then she may be concerned that you , her mother might also unexpectedly leave or disappear . She is only 3 and is limited on her ability to communicate and understand these abandoning feelings and may have created an abundance of imaginary friends because she knows she can count on them not leaving . She may not be able to say , `` Mommy , are you going to leave too ? '' But she can create a fantasy of dolls and imaginary friends that support and validate her feelings . So while I would n't say that you should seek clinical therapy for your 3 year old , I would suggest that a sincere heart to heart with your daughter , and some invested mommy time , you could really help your daughter reconnect to the real supports in her life , you ! Suggestion : Find a way to validate her feelings . Having a drawing party ! Allow her to draw , and invite her imaginary friends to draw also . Sit at a table that is age appropriate for her ( or sit on the floor ) and allow her to describe to you the drawings of all the friends , as well as her own drawing . You might suggest to her drawing a few pictures . Maybe one of `` our new house '' . Have another drawing of `` our family '' , and her school/friends , room or house . You will learn a lot from her and it will allow her practice in expressing her feelings to you , her mom , rather than dolls and friends . Find age appropriate ways of bonding with your daughter . I would love to hear what you try and how it turns out ! Good Luck ! emailjacquisoon @ yahoo.com",0

"What is that growth on Frank Beamer 's Neck ? What on earth is that thing on Frank Beamer 's Neck ? ( Frank Beamer is the coach of Virginia Tech ) Beamer grew up on a 70-acre farm in Fancy Gap , Va . In 1954 , when he was seven years old , he used a push broom to help keep a pile of burning trash in place . When the job was done he returned the broom to the garage , unaware that its brushes were still smoldering . A spark ignited a can of nearby gasoline , which exploded in front of him . His 11-year old brother , Barrett , saved him by rolling him around on the ground , but Frank was left with burns on the right side of his neck , chest and his shoulders . Over the next few years he endured dozens of painful skin grafts and was left with permanent scarring .",0

"World of Warcraft -- which class ? Hi ! what class out of mage and rogue do you think is the best ? i personally like rogue best , but lately i tried the mage , and it was kick butt . what do you think ? and what race ( and profession ) is the best for that class ? Both are played alot , and both do great damage . But I think later on it would be better to do Mage instead Rogue . A Mage will have an easier time finding a party for things like instances such as UBRS , LBRS , MC , ect . Human would be a good race because of the extra reputation they gain.. As far as profession , Enchanting is always good because either you can make gold off the enchanting supplies or enchanting other 's items or your own . Cloth working is another great profession beings you would wear cloth and you will be able to make yourself some awsome robes , ect later on . Mages are `` wtfpwn '' or so they say , also alot of fun ... I have alot of lvl 60 's on the Silvermoon server and Mage was always a fun class of mine , hardly anyone could beat me , as on my other alts I was hardly ever able to beat a Mage . If you ever go onto the Silvermoon server , I am always either on Druidess ( Druid ) on Alliance side or Kelpie ( Rogue ) on the Horde side . I 'm always willing to help . Just pick whatever you enjoy playing the most . All of them are fun in their own way.. and if you like to solo alot you would have an easier time on Rogue but later on when you want your class sets you would have an easier time as Mage to get them .",0

"motherboard bios ? i just did something in bios that i regret . the option where you load optimal settings . after doing so my pc wont boot . any suggestions ? Check for a `` Reset BIOS '' or `` Reset CMOS '' jumper on your motherboard .

Wait 5 seconds then put it back to the original position . You should then be able to turn it back on , with the BIOS reset to the manufacturer default . This will also eliminate most BIOS passwords.If this does not work , you may be outta luck . The changes in the BIOS are probably permanent .

"What can the United States do to improve it 's relations with India ? well , one easy way to improve relations with india would be to side with them in the border dispute with pakistan over the territory of kashmir . this politically untenable in the united states however , and has the potential to drag the US into what could turn into a nuclear war . so that 's right out.another option would be to sign a preferential trade agreement with india , but this would likely be nixed by the WTO.giving them free stuff is always a plus , but that costs money.probably the best thing the US can do is to continue doing what it 's doing - particularly , outsourcing software jobs at wages well above india 's national average , allowing lots of indian students to come to the US to study , hiring indians on work visas for high-paying jobs , and continuing free trade in infrastructure like steel and concrete to support india 's growth.the biggest bone of contention is probably the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . india is one of a very few nations which has refused to sign it and this is a big problem for the US . india will receive only limited military support from america until the two countries reconcile their differences over this treaty .",0

"Why US try to develop a democratic power in IRAQ when they will never be a democratic nation ? Who is to say that IRAQ will not be a democratic nation .

I wo n't even get into why but the war would be in Saudi Arabia where the oil reserves are over twice the size of Iraq.We need to look back in history to see what has happened and the future looks bright for IRAQ . Success in Central America , Liberia , Korea , the new Russia , the slavic regions , and others have formed some type of democracy.The `` democracy '' that other countries enjoy are definately not the same as ours , but even a Monarchy like Morocco has a democratic government.Success in IRAQ will indeed depend on whether democracy becomes the new form of government when America finally does pull out or if there will be political chaos and insergency.Time will only tell.To correct a couple of the other writers above me ... The United States is NOT a democratic country , it is a Federal Republic . If indeed we were a true democracy Gore would be president not George Bush ( Gore won more of the popular vote but less of the electoral vote ) .

"what do you do for excessive mucus production ? I have excessive mucus production . I have two sinus surgerys , but the mucus was there befor the surgerys . It is so bad that it comes from my gums . I have a bad cough , it always produces a mouth full of mucus . It pockets in the back of my throat . It has gotten so bad that it disrupts my sleep . I take a cloth to bed each night to clean my mouth . If any one has ever had this problem , please let me know what you did for relife . I have spent a small fortune on doctors and medicine . As of now , no help . Thank you . I had the same problem , I could n't breathe through my nose because , my nose and mouth were constantly full of mucus and I was constantly spitting out this gunk . Sometimes , I would be choking and gagging in my sleep . A relative sent me a print-out of the side effects of the medication I was taking . It included breathing problems , mucus buildup , nodules ( which I now have exactly where my sinuses are ) and a lot of other dangerous side effects . I went off the med . and while I still have some mucus production it is no where near what it used to be . My doctor tried to get me to go back on the same med . even after I told him about the mucus problems it caused . He said it did n't do that . When I insisted that it did , he looked it up on his computer and then said `` if that happens again , you can always go off it '' . Needless to say , I refused to take it . Also , on one exam , the nurse told me I had polyps in my nose . She told me to see an ENT and have them removed ( surgically ) . I am glad I did n't . I just saw an M.D . on tv who said that when polyps in your nose are removed , they usually will come back . He said a safe non-surgical way to get rid of them is to use Nasonex twice a day and it is safe to do that . I think I 'll take his advice and try it . I do n't know why some doctors first advice is surgery especially if there is a non-surgical way to remedy a problem . I hope you find a solution to your problems .",0

"Where do EBAY powersellers get their merchandise ? It has to do with being at the right place and at the right time . Many of the big powersellers have had access to low cost products in several ways . 1 . Discontinued products . Many times , a product line gets discontinued with a newer model . The older model becomes very difficult to sell . Someone comes in and agree to buy the whole lot for a fraction of the manufactor 's price . It helps the retailer keep their products fresh and minimizes loss.2 . Refurbished . Manufactor refurbishes a product and sells it in a white box for a fraction of the price of the original product sold in the retail box . Manufactors get the products from the retailers as a returned item and has to credit the retailer . This gives the manufactor an opportunity to recover the loss . Some powersellers established a business relationship with the manufactor to purchase those refurbished products.3 . Retailer Returns . A powerseller may have signed a deal with a retailer that says they 'll pay cents on the dollar for everything the retailer gets returned.So lets say retailer buys something for $ 10 from the manufactorer and sells it to the consumer for $ 25 . Items will always get returned either damaged , unopened , or opened and for any variety of reasons . If the retailer returns it to the manufactorer , they may get a credit of about $ 1 or $ 2 . The powerseller buys the products for $ 3 , $ 4 , or $ 5 . Taking the chance , they know that at least a minimum % of the products to be working and can sell the working products.4 . Directly from the manufactor or distributor . As more products you buy in bulk , the greater the discount the manufactor give the buyer .",0

"Why does n't the Jewish religion believe in Jesus if he was a Jew ? Maybe this is all ignorance on my part . I do n't know . I really want to know . Truly and honestly , I 'm just trying to educate myself further . Any explanations are greatly appreciated . PLEASE look at the following : :http : //WhatJewsBelieve.orghttp : //Convert.org The basic beliefs of Christianity about Jesus are against what the Bible says , and so Real Jews can not believe in Jesus at all.The Christian understanding is that the Messiah , Jesus , died for the sins of the people . The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin.But we are taught in our Torah that no one can die for the sins of another . In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death forthe fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin ( eesh b ’ chet-o yumatu ) .In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself to atone for the sins of the people . To be written out of Gd 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . Gd 's response is No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : Exodus 32:30-35 And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Etrnl ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Etrnl , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Etrnl said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book . The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for Gd 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd will forgive us.So , the Bible is clear , no one can die for the sins of another , and this means that Jesus can not die for anyone else 's sins.Christians also believe that one needs a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin , that one who does not have such a blood sacrifice will die in their sins , and go to hell , except for the sacrifice of Jesus.This , too , is UnBiblical . The Bible describes blood sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin in the Book of Leviticus . But it is in Leviticus itself , in the middle of the discussion of the sin sacrifices , that we are taught that we do not need a blood sacrifice to be forgiven for our sins . Offering a blood sacrifice was an expensive thing to do for the family offering the animal . Was forgiveness then , to be only for the rich ? No , because if one could not afford a blood sacrifice then one who sins could bring flour , which has no blood and no life as their sacrifice , and Gd forgave them ! Leviticus 5:11-13 ; But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering ; he shall put no oil upon it , neither shall he put any frankincense thereon : for it is a sin offering.Furthermore , read the Book of Jonah . In Jonah , the People of Ninevah do three things in order to be forgiven by Gd . They fast , they pray for forgiveness , and they stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgave them ! This is exactly what we do on Yom Kippur , we fast , we pray for forgiveness , and , hopefully , we stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgives us . And what book do we read on Yom Kippur afternoon ? The Book of Jonah ! Jonah 3:7-10 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Ninevah , by the decree of the King and his nobles , saying , Let neither man nor beast , herd nor flock taste anything ; let them not feed nor drink water ; but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto Gd ; yea , let them turn every one from his evil",0

"Which would you be : rich or poor ? Rich , you are wealthy . Poor your the average citizen.Tell me why you would be either ( Rich-Good or Bad , Poor-Good or Bad ) . There really is no Black or White answer to this question . Even though , I am sure there are many `` rich '' people in the world who are nice , I 've seen many more who are not so much . In my experience , money has a tendency to change people , even when that person has the best intentions at heart . Although I would love to have more money , I would never wish to be `` rich '' , only comfortable enough to be able to support myself , with no loose ends . I may be going agains the grain , here with my answer , but I think I lean more towards `` poor '' . Those who are poor , or live from paycheck to paycheck , tend to appreciate the small things as we all should . `` Poor '' people do not care about having extravagant houses or 5 cars , one for each day of the week ; they are content with a roof over their family 's head , a meal for each night , and an old dependable clunker to get around in .",0

I think Man is adding on his own ideas because anything different scares him . the funny thing is , the original text of the OLD testament did n't say anything about homosexuality being a sin either . the part that 's commonly translated to say `` a man should not lie with another man as he would lie with a woman , that is detestable '' was originally mistranslated on PURPOSE when some homophobic church leaders got together to write the king james version ... the original hebrew text translates to `` a man should not lie with another man in a woman 's bed , that is unclean '' . so basically there 's no restriction on who can have sex with whom , just where they are allowed to do it .",0

"what is lipoma and what types of procedures are used to remove it ? Lipomas are benign , slow-growing tumors that come from fat cells . They are not cancer . They are usually round , moveable , flattened lumps under the skin . They feel soft and doughy or rubbery . Lipomas usually grow in the neck , shoulders , back , or arms . They can occur at any age , but they often appear when you 're between 40 and 60 years of age . Sometimes they run in families . Sometimes they are caused by an injury . Most lipomasdo not hurt unless they are squeezed or bruised.Because lipomas are almost always benign ( not cancer ) , they usually do not need treatment . If they are painful or are growing quickly , you may want to have treatment . Treatment options include steroid shots , liposuction , or surgery . Your doctor can help you decide what is best for you.As always , check with your doctor to make sure it is a lipoma and to discuss treatment .",0

"When I read Isaiah 53 , I see the saving death of Jesus perfectly described there . Why do n't the Jews see Him ? It is not that the Jews are blind , it is that Christians see the Hebrew Scriptures through Jesus-colored glasses . Since they read the Christian 's New Testament first , then the TaNaCH , they see the TaNaCH through the lens of Christianity . If read on its own , with no knowledge of , or belief in , Christianity , the Hebrew Scriptures would not be seen as being about Jesus.Jews dont see the Christian interpretation in Isaiah 53 , because it contradicts what the Hebrew Scriptures , the Bible says , clearly and consistently , in at least 3 places : In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself as an atonement for the sins of the people . To be written out of God 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . God 's response was `` No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : '' Exodus 32:30-35And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Eternal ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Eternal , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Eternal said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book ... nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the father . Every man must die for his own sin.The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for God 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and God will forgive us . Nowhere in this chapter does it say that we have to have a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins.Ezekiel 18:1-4 ; 20-24 ; 26-27 ... ..Behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul that sinneth , it shall die ... .The soul that sinneth , it shall die . The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father , neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son : the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him , and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him . But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die . All his transgressions that he hath committed , they shall not be mentioned unto him : in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live . Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die ? saith the Eternal God : and not that he should return from his ways , and live ? So , either Deuteronomy 24:16 , `` Every man must die for his own sin '' does not mean that 'every man must die for his own sin , ' and the Christian interpretation of Isaiah 53 is correct , or the Christian interpretation of Isaiah 53 is not correct , and Deuteronomy 24:16 , 'Every man must die for his own sins ' means exactly what it says.Furthermore , Jews read Isaiah up to ( and including Isaiah 53 ) and Isaiah repeatedly refers specifically to the Jews as Gd 's servant . Read Isaiah 41:8 ; Isaiah 44:21 ; Isaiah 45:4 ; Isaiah 49:3 ; Isaiah 44:1 ; Isaiah 48:20 and Isaiah 49:7 Lets concentrate on Isaiah 43:10 : :Isaiah 43:10 `` You are my witnesses , saith the Etrnl , and my servant whom I have chosen : that ye may know and believe me , and understand that I am he : before me there was no Gd formed , neither shall there be after me .

"who is guru ? The syllable gu means shadowsThe syllable ru , he who disperses them , Because of the power to disperse darknessthe guru is thus named.A guru ( गुरू Sanskrit ) is a teacher in Hinduism , Buddhism or Sikhism . Based on a long line of philosophical understanding as to the importance of knowledge , the guru is seen in these religions as a sacred conduit , or a way to self-realization . In India and among people of Hindu , Buddhist , or Sikh belief , the title retains a hallowed meaning.Guru also refers in Sanskrit to Brihaspati , a Hindu figure analogous to the Roman planet/god Jupiter . In Vedic astrology , Jupiter/Guru/Brihaspati is believed to exert teaching influences . Indeed , in many Indian languages , such as Hindi , the occidental Thursday is called either Brihaspativaar or Guruvaar ( vaar meaning period or day ) .In contemporary India and Indonesia , Guru is widely used within the general meaning of `` teacher '' . In Western usage , the original meaning of guru has been extended to cover anyone who acquires followers , though not necessarily in an established school of philosophy or religion . In a further metaphorical extension , guru is used to refer to a person who has authority because of his or her perceived knowledge or skills in a domain of expertise.The importance of discerning between a true guru and a false one is explored in scriptures and teachings of religions in which a guru plays a role . The assessment and criticism of gurus and the Guru-shishya tradition are espoused in the discourse about cults and new religious movements by Western secular scholars , theologians , anti-cultists and by skeptics both in the West and in India .",0

"Surgeons ... ... . ? Three surgeons and a clumsy cook go camping in the remote wilderness . The clumsy cook stumbles over the campfire as he is serving the surgeons , injuring himself and dumping hot stew on the hands of the surgeons . The cook 's injuries need surgical treatment . The surgeons ' injuries are minor but open . It turns out they brought the equipment necessary for the cook 's surgery with them , and they can use the campfire to sterilize the tools . But there are only two rubber gloves . Because of the different surgeons ' skills , all three of the surgeons are needed to operate on the cook , in sequence . How can this be done without any of them being exposed to the blood of any of the others ? The first surgeon operates with the first glove inside the second glove . The second surgeon operates using just the second . The third surgeon operates using the first glove , turned inside out , inside the second glove.Thanks for making me think . : )",0

"need free advice/help with a resume. ? Look up resume examples online , find the types of `` jobs '' that appeal to you . Then match up what your talents are `` that you make you an asset to that particular position '' and convince the industry of what you have to offer in your resume . Many HR personnel do n't really care what you have done for your own interest in resumes , they are looking for what you have done that will be the best match to the position they are offering.Do some research , once you get a `` job '' with an industries , you can have a better feel for the position that interest you more from the inside of the company.I 'm not saying minimize your education , but you can leave out bits of experience that may not seem like an asset to them . Sometimes less is more . Then build on your qualifications and abilities , to advance to positions you find more interesting.There are auto resume builders available to walk you through how to put it all together in a professional manner , but using the format of resume examples on line should work well.I 'll also say try to keep the pages to a 2 page minimum , after that HR loses interest .",0

"is a mp3 better than an i-pod ? In my opinion , i would think that an MP3 player is better than an iPod . i have several of reasons why.1 . There are pretty much two formats that will work on MP3 players : MP3 and WMA . On iPods , you can only download one format that you ca n't actually listen to on your computer.2 . For an iPod , you have to buy music off an online store . for an MP3 player , if you own the music , you can put it on the MP3 player.3 . iPods tend to cost WAY more than MP3 players.4 . the only reason why iPods are more popular is because that they have good ads and word of mouth got around fast.so , if you are only going to be using it for listening to music , an MP3 player would be better . Likewise , there are things that an iPod can do that others ca n't . iPods generally hold a lot more songs than MP3 players . also , the new iPods can download videos onto them , so you can actually watch music videos on your iPod ! you can also look at picture slideshows on your iPod as well.so , in conclusion if you do n't want to spend as much and you only want to listen to music , choose an MP3 player . if you want to view music videos and pictures , choose an iPod.hope i helped !",0
"Why do people every six minutes have to ask which came first the chicken or the egg ? The answer is always the egg . Thats the correct answer anyway . 1 ) Because they can ? : ^ ) 2 ) Because they like to stir up debates between creationists and evolutionists.3 ) Because they think it is an unanswerable riddle when it isn't.It is an interesting question but people really do n't think it through enough to show just how interesting it is . How you answer the question reflects on your belief system , your powers of deductive reasoning , and/or your sense of humor.If you subscribe to evolution ( as I do ) , then it 's very simple -- eggs existed long before chickens ever did . Fish lay eggs . Amphibians lay eggs . Reptiles lay eggs . Dinosaurs layed eggs . Prototypical birds layed eggs . Early mammals layed eggs . ( Even current mammals called monotremes lay eggs ) . So obviously eggs came before chickens by this line of reasoning.Following evolutionary theory , genetics , and the development of embryos , one might argue that again , the egg came before the chicken because the first chicken is a genetic mutation of two chicken like parents . So , from this line of reasoning , you might , again argue the egg if you are talking about first chicken relative to the egg . For the first chicken had to develop inside the egg as the offspring of two chicken-like parents.But then I realized `` Hey , how did the first zygotic chicken ( fertilized ovum ) get inside the egg in the first place ? '' If the ovum was inside an egg shell with yoke and rooster sperm is added afterward , then the egg comes first . But what if the the ovum is fertilized first , then encased in an egg shell ? Then would not the zygotic chicken come before the egg ? A quick look on Wikipedia for bird reproduction indicates that the eggs are fertilized with sperm during the descent from the ovaries through the cloaca . If this is the case , then , again , the egg comes before the chicken.So , I forgot to add one reason people ask this question every six minutes:4 ) Because they have too much time on their hands . : ^ )",0

"Why does an apple is refered to a kid or learning ? I sometimes see an apple along with a student or a kid . From wikipedia : '' In the United States , Denmark and Sweden , an apple ( polished ) is a traditional gift for a teacher . This stemmed from the fact that teachers during the 16th to 18th centuries were poorly paid , so parents would compensate the teacher by providing food . As apples were a very common crop , teachers would often be given baskets of apples by students . As wages increased , the quantity of apples was toned down to a single fruit . `` So I guess it was so common that it become a symbol for teaching and learning .",0

"how can end premature ejaculation ? i used to practise masturbation since I was 15 and spoilt my sexual functioning to result to premature ejaculation.Nowadays I cant enjoy sex with women because I finish the round so Easy ! I am now 23 having quit masturbation just October 2005 . The praecox ejaculation just is a PSYCHOLOGICAL problem . Besides , with that term is specified any ejaculation that occurs involuntarily during the sexual act and BEFORE the penetration can occur even . Any short time concerning the duration of the sexual act mustn ’ t confused with the premature ejaculation . In fact , medically the penetration and the ejaculation inside the vagina exclude the problem . Some drug could be taken , but ONLY with the consent of the doctor while for you problem there are some different method to use . It ’ s not the right place here to prolong and if you just has too shame to talk with the doctor I ’ ll advice you to buy some specific book.I guess that your request is connected with your partner satisfaction.In fact , the most part of women need longer times for reaching orgasm than men.You know that the average time is within 15-30 min. , but it gets no sense if our partner needs a different time . Therefore , we must compare our time ( short or long ) with our partner ’ s one ! I only can give you some advices now.Try to begin the full act ( penetration ) as late as possible using in the meanwhile other methods ( you know ) to excite your partner . While “ acting ” try to think about different stuffs , just to distract your mind . Somebody stops the act a bit before the apex , just to avoid the forthcoming ejaculation or stop frequently the penetration during the act ( continuing to excite the partner anyway ) .Then , if you are able to have two acts consecutively , the most will already be done !",0

"On what basis are the days on which Christian marriages are to be conducted chosen ? For example , Some are held on Mondays and Thursdays only , some on Sundays etc There is no `` blanket rule '' , so it comes down to guidelines from the specific denomination , and at times , availability of a pastor or the specific facility . E.g . always booked on Sundays for regular services , very buys on Saturdays with services or preparations for Sunday , the pastor is tired on Mondays , and needs a `` one day breather '' .If you have a specific church/facility in mind , ask them for their guidelines/availabilities , and reasons for it .",0
"gay marriage ? Earlier today I read answers to a question that went something like `` if you had only a month to live what would you do ? '' One of the responses was from a gay man who referred to ( among other things ) making sure his accounts etc . were set up so that his `` husband '' had financial security after his death . It is obvious that , although he loves his partner dearly and considers him his husband , he does not enjoy the same rights and privileges that heterosexual married couples take for granted.I would like to hear from gay couples detailing the disadvantages they face due to not being allowed a legal marriage . ( personal experiences only , please - I can do a google search and find the HRC website on my own ) When I got sick and my husband took me to the emergency room , I had to state that I wanted him to go with me because he is not 'family ' and we are not married . I had to state over and over that I wanted him in the room each time a nurse would enter and have something they needed to do . We found out when getting car insurance for both of our cars that if we were married we would get a discount , but because we are not and because our State does not recognize our union , we could not receive those discounts.At work when filing out my medical insurance information ... part of the benefits of my job ... I was not allowed to list my husband as a beneficiary because the term 'spouse ' is defined as being someone of the opposite gender whom you are married to . Had we any children I was informed that I might not have been able to include them either since the State I reside in only allows for one person in a same-sex union to adopt , the other person is n't allowed to adopt that child . When listing whom I wanted as the beneficiary of the life insurance , I could not list my husband with the same benefits a married couple would receive . He would receive much less if I died than he would have if he had been married to a woman . That was upsetting.My husband is Native American . In his tribe while they do not have any laws stating that same-sex marriage is illegal , when he inquired he was told that it is against traditions and that there is no way two people of the same-sex could be recognized in the tribe as a married couple . When asked about adopting children , he was told that adopted children are not considered a part of the tribe and can not participate in tribal activities . When asked if he had a child , surogate , with a woman that was biologically his and adopted by me if the child could still participate in tribal activities he was told that the child could not because it did not reside in a heterosexual married union ... and that also because I am not part of the tribe.We have talked with lawyers about all the legal things we can do . It would all costs far more money than we have , would require a great deal of court time , and even then there is no guarantee that the courts would honor our requests nor is their a guarantee that the legal documents would be honored by our families ( who could dispute them ) . Perhaps the one thing that bothers me most is n't so much all the legal aspects , it 's that people do n't take seriously our commitment and love for each other . When amongst other people when we refer to each other as husbands there are many people who are quick to remind us that we are n't really husbands ( from heteros and homos both ) . It is n't unusual for people to say things about our relationship that they 'd never say to or about a married couple . There is a big disrespect towards us done each time others invalidate and belittle our commitment , our relationship , and our love for each other . That hurts a lot more than the legal issues , but it often underlies the very problems of why such legal issues are n't resolved.And for the record , we are in our mid-twenties , so while many people seem to think that only 'old ' gay people are dealing with these issues ... They 're not .",0
