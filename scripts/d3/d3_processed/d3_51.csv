"what is the best band around today and why ? I think that the best band around for the moment and probably for a long time is Linkin Park . Their music is uplifting and has helped many people just with the lyrics alone . They are different and not like any other band today . I know that they have helped me through some rough times in life just with their music . I had the opportunity just this last weekend to meet Mike Shinoda ( the MC of LP ) with his side project group Fort Minor in St. Paul , MN . He is very humble and does n't act like any other artist out there today .",1

"Comics ! ! ! ! ! ? DOSE ANY ONE WISH TO BUY SOME 70 'S MARVEL AND DC COMICS It would depend on what you 're selling . You 'd definitely get more bang for your buck if you tried Ebay .

"Which Version of Star Trek do you like best and why ? The Next Generation was BY FAR the best to me.Now I 'm too old to know about the Original Series too much , and the special effects are too corny for me now adays . Anyway ... Here 's why TNG is the best.-Dynamic characters that do n't seem too forced ( you 'll see the oposite later ) -The Enterprise was not DOOMED every episode - sometimes it was just about one or two characters-Was VERY optimistic about the future-Spoke about conditions of humanity and why we 're the way we are.DS9 was my second favor , but there 's some tihngs I did n't like ... -Too political for my liking ( I hate the Bajoran and Klingon episodes ) -Much dimmer view of the future-The Difiant is all that 's given to protect the MOST IMPORTANT STATION in the galxy ? ! I ca n't suspend THAT much disbelief.Even so : -I really liked Sisko and some of the other characters-Good to see O'Brien get a big part-Aweosme battle sequences and suchNext is Voyager , which had a few REALLY good seasons . ( I think season 1 and 2 were better then most of DS9 ) Unfortunatly ... there were problems ... -everyone seemed TOO diverse . ( an asian guy , a white guy , woman captain , half klingon , Indian , hologram , alien ect . ) -too many 'back in time ' plots . -EVERY episode saw Voyager in iminent danger-After 7 came on , most characters did n't even matter anymore ! ( Kim , Tuvok ) And Enterprise ? Well..-The idea of a prequal is kinda dumb to me-Why are the Vulcans asses ? -As soon as they had the 'de-tox ' segment in one of the first episodes , where they striped down and oiled up ... I knew it was over .

"Why are people so obssesed with Howard Stern ? I admitt , he is entertaining to watch ... but why all the posts/questions about him ? It 's probably because of the huge media attention about Howard leaving terrestrial radio -- you know , traditional AM/FM radio stations -- in favor of satellite programming service Sirius . The deal is an enormous one ( reportedly $ 500 million ) and there is a tremendous amount of attention being paid to the change . His last day on traditional radio was today , and he will launch his satellite programs in about three weeks.Additonally , Howard is one of the greatest self-promoters around . He 's spent the past year since the deal was announced talking about his move , often on his terrestrial network show . It has created a lot of friction and , of course , more attention about Howard and his big move.I do n't know if his fans , or the public in general , are more obsessed with Howard now that he 's making this change . It will allow him to do whatever he wants , as opposed to the obscenity restrictions enforced on broadcast radio by the FCC . I think it 's some of both . While many of his fans ca n't wait for Howard to do literally anything , I think that a lot of hoopla is just all the hype . He 's a national figure getting this huge deal for what is essentially an unknown quantity in Sirius . There have been some real gains in their susbscriptions as they approach the launch , but whether they will bring in enough only time -- and Howard 's popularity -- will tell .",1

"how is dan fogelbergs health ? This was posted on Dan Fofelberg 's official websiteIn May of 2004 , Dan was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer.August 13 , 2005A personal letter from D.F.First , let me send everyone some very good news . In our first 14 months of treatment , we have succeeded in slowing the progression of my prostate cancer down to an almost negligible level . Jean and I are thrilled and incredibly relieved and finally feel like we can at last take a breath . While we understand that what we ’ re dealing with is a long term condition that will have to be dealt with , monitored and treated for probably the rest of my life , we are terribly encouraged to have come so far , so fast . It has certainly been the most trying experience of our lives and yet has proven to be one of the most illuminating as well ... ... ..I currently have no plans to return to the concert stage or the recording studio in the foreseeable future , but who knows ? At least for now , I prefer to keep my options open.Good wishes for Dan can be posted at : http : //www.thelivinglegacy.net/wishes.html",1
"television casting ? I was recently reading a list of characters needed for a certain show with their descriptions ( i.e . brown hair , blue eyes , short stature etc . ) But how come it never said the pay offered ? How do the agent and producer determine the actors pay ? Is it a percentage of something ? If so what ? If you 're just starting out in the industry , the companies will pay whatever `` scale '' is as determined by the Screen Actors Guild ( a labor union ) . Once experience is gained and the person becomes more well-known , so does their cost as they can afford agents/attorneys , etc . You can read more about the union at the link below .",1

"I recently discovered that my ascendant sign was Aires rather than cancer , how would this affect my chart ? My sun sign is `` virgo '' and I 'm particularly interested in the `` Love '' and `` Career '' elements of my chart . It mainly affects which horoscopes you should read . The rising sign is just as important as the Sun sign , and sometimes more so . You need to read Aries as well as Virgo.Horoscope forecasts are written as if each sign is in the rising position ( the `` 9 o'clock '' on a horoscope chart ) . Houses are arranged counterclockwise : the second house is at `` 8 o'clock , '' the third house is at `` 7 o'clock , '' and so on . If you 're a Virgo with Aries rising , Aries is at `` 9 o'clock '' ( first house ) and Virgo is five signs away at `` 4 o'clock '' ( sixth house ) .Horoscope forecasts describe events that relate to planetary activity in the houses . They 'll often describe the effect of a particular planet on each of the signs , and the planet will affect each sign in different ways.Let 's say the day 's forecasts talk about a planet that 's currently in Saggitarius . In a Virgo forecast , this would affect the person 's home and family life , since Sagittarius is on usually on the cusp of the fourth house of a chart with Virgo rising . This forecast would only be relevant to people of *any* sun sign with Virgo rising , but not Virgos with a different rising sign . A person with Aries rising ( and *any* sun sign ) would read the Aries forecast . That same planet in Sagittarius would affect the Aries forecast differently : The forecast would likely describe travel , higher education , or religion , since since Sagittarius is on usually on the cusp of the ninth house of a chart with Virgo rising . This forecast would only be relevant to people of *any* sun sign with Aries rising , but *not* Aries people with a different rising sign.This is why you need to read the chart for your rising sign ( Aries ) , so that you get the correct effect of the planetary activity in question.Hope this helps .",1

"How do you rate a movie/play ? I 'm very curious about this . My Grandma died four years ago , and just before she died , she took my cousin and I to see Phantom of the Opera . It was her favorite musical . It was the last musical she ever took us to.I told my cousin that now my second favorite musical is Rent , and that my first is Wicked . She asked if there were any other plays that I had cried at . I said I almost cried at Phantom , but it is n't one of my favorite musicals ... I 've never truly been able to love the music . I like it ... but not in the same way I do Wicked or Rent.She got mad , and we fought , but it got me to thinking ... how many people judge a movie or a play based on who they were with/the time the had during it . And how many people can set that aside and judge based solely on the movie or play itself . So , which way do you do it ? I base movies/musicals based solely on my enjoyment of them . It has to be entertaining and a good story , otherwise its not gon na be a favorite . As an aside - I definitely agree about Wicked - I LOVE it ( both because I enjoyed the story and that I saw it for the first time with my best friend . )",1

"how small can you get a mp3 song and how would you do it ? when i rip songs from cds ( about 4 min songs ) they can be from 3-8mb can i make them smaller but not wreck the sound quality.and will the music work on an mp3 player mp3 is a compression of your music . The standard is from CD to 128 kbit/s w/ cd quality being 1400 kbit/s . To make smaller , you compress more and therefore take away quality ( details are taken out to compress . ) There are other compression formats to use , but by definition they all compress the info and therefore lose quality . Try 96 kbit/s and see if you notice a difference . ( This will be found in the recording media ; ie . the program that `` rips '' CD to mp3 . ) Again 128 is standard for not noticing quality loss . VBR is a good choice . It breaks the songs into segments so that low quality sections can have lower bit rate . Set VBR from 96-128 .",1

"Why is the color in a 50 year old movie so much better than in a new movie ? `` better '' is a very subjective term . Technicolor process films allowed for super-saturated colors to be seen in the final print . Currently there is n't any process similar to that in wide use . Technicolor used three strips of black and white film , each exposed through a filter ( red , green , blue ) to capture the original images . Then in a lab , each of the black and white strips were exposed against color film print stock with the same color filter . This process also led to occasional color mis-registration in some films where the lab work was rushed or done sloppily.Most modern films are shot on single-strips of negative with three dye layers of emulsion that are each sensitive to different color wavelengths . ( see the first link below ) A very popular film stock these days is Kodak 's 5279 `` vision 500T '' which has a very high ISO yet does n't get as grainy as previous high ISO films . ( see second link below ) Because films nowadays are shot on single-strip film , super-saturating colors requires post-processing for color-timing , such as digital intermediate processing ( see link 3 below for Discreet 's DI product info . ) Directors also like to have a lot of creative control over the look and feel of a film that is done through the color timing process ( see the 4th link , although the entry is incorrect as Pleasantville was the first film to be completely digitally color-graded in 1998 ) This can include adding hues or increasing or reducing contrast - good examples are in Cinderella Man and Lord of the Rings : ROTK",1

ELLEN DEGENERES Host and Executive Producer of her own t.v . show . `` Ellen '' Date of birth ( location ) 26 January 1958Metairie , Louisiana , USA A beloved television icon and entertainment pioneer , Ellen DeGeneres ' distinctive comic voice has resonated with audiences from her first stand-up comedy appearances through her work today on television , in film and in the literary world.DeGeneres has made a home for herself in the daytime arena with her hit syndicated talk show , `` The Ellen DeGeneres Show , ” now in its third season , the show has won nine Daytime Emmys , including Outstanding Talk Show in its first two seasons and Outstanding Talk Show Host . Additionally , DeGeneres won the People ’ s Choice Awards two years in a row for Favorite Daytime Talk Show Host and Favorite Funny Female Star . She also won the Producers Guild Award this past year for Outstanding Variety Television Show . `` The Ellen DeGeneres Show '' was launched in September 2003 to great success . In its freshman year , the show won four Daytime Emmys , including Outstanding Talk Show , after garnering a record twelve nominations . In its second season , the show won five Daytime Emmys.In 2005 , DeGeneres appears in the American Express ad campaign `` My Life , My Card , '' including a national commercial and a print campaign shot by famed photographer Annie Liebowitz . The campaign provided DeGeneres the opportunity to produce and star in a short film for the Tribeca Film Festival , entitled `` My Short Film , '' a short film about making short films . The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival and viewable online.Prior to the launch of her talk show , DeGeneres scored a rare coup in 2004 with simultaneous achievements on stage , film and in the literary world . She enjoyed unprecedented popular and critical response to her character , 'Dory , ' the fish with extreme short term memory , in the blockbuster Disney/Pixar animated feature film , `` Finding Nemo . '' Written and directed by Andrew Stanton , and co-starring Albert Brooks and Willem Dafoe among others , the Academy Award winner for Best Animated Film has made over $ 850 million dollars worldwide to date , making it one of the highest grossing computer-animated films in history , as well as one of the highest domestic grossing films of 2003 .

DeGeneres crossed the country on a 35-city stand-up comedy tour , entitled the `` Here and Now '' tour . The series of shows included a performance at the famed Beacon Theater in New York , which was taped for HBO . The resulting special aired on June 28th , 2003 and scored higher ratings than any HBO comedy special had in years . It was subsequently nominated for two Emmys including Outstanding Individual Performance In A Variety Or Music Program and Outstanding Variety , Music Or Comedy Special . HBO followed by releasing the special on DVD . In October , 2003 , Simon & Schuster published DeGeneres ' second book , The Funny Thing Is ... , comprised of the author 's comedic short stories and essays . The book hit the New York Times ' Bestseller list upon its release . In 2005 , DeGeneres was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for the audio version of the book . A performer with a keen sense of comedy in the moment , DeGeneres garnered rave reviews for her performance hosting the 2001 Primetime Emmy Awards . Taking the reins of the high profile event with assuredness , she provided a perfect balance of wit with heartfelt emotion and gave the post-September 11th telecast audience a reason to laugh . DeGeneres ' career began as an emcee at a local comedy club in her hometown of New Orleans , which led to national recognition in 1982 when her videotaped club performances won Showtime 's `` Funniest Person In America .

"Have you seen Munich ? How was it ? are you referring to the city or the movie ? since your question 's in the movie category , i assume this is about the movie ? the one starring eric bana ? This movie attempts to illuminate both sides of Israel 's conflict . While the focus is on Israeli actions and choices , Palestinian and Arab motivations are present throughout the work . For me , Speilberg 's treatment of both sides was an attempt at balance . Neither side is commended or exaulted for their behavior . Instead , the film attempts to generally question the nature of their decisions and acts . If this film does make any stance on Israel and Palestine , it makes a general condemnation of the violence on both sides . Speilberg goes through great lengths to show the cycle of violence - lamenting the perpetual loss of life in violent conflict.The film 's conclusion extends Speilberg 's effort to question violence and its role in human affairs . The protagonist chooses against returning home - he lives in exile . The cycle of violence has taken a toll on him . I 'm unclear in deciding whether the protagonist approves or condemns of his own choices . But I do believe that he realizes that violence is not a future solution . I think that this was a geniune attempt at thoughtful reflection of the consequences of violent conflict . For a mainstream movie , this had unusual depth . I felt that there was an honest attempt to depict both sides as human beings - with rational , legitmate values and motivations . I would encourage anyone to see this film . Audiences should try to analyze both the film 's perspective and their our own beliefs on the real world content behind the work . Any film that can spark people to pose these serious questions deserves attention .",1

I am a young actor as well . I highly recommend reading AUDITION by Michael Shurtleff . 1 . Speak at a good pace and be LOUD ( little to no chance of landing the part if they ca n't hear you ) 2 . Do n't memorize anything unless you have to . It will not impress the person casting if you can memorize something . Memorizing unnecessarily wastes energy on remembering when it could be used towards acting.3 . Be respectful and attentive to the auditor but DO NOT MAKE SMALL TALK WITH THE AUDITOR . They are there to work.4 . Get familiar with the play so you can be more prepared to accuratly portray your piece . 5 . Practice , Practice , Practice . Practice in front of people ( and get feedback ) , practice to a mirror.6 . If memorization is necessary , memorize it like the back of your hand . Once you get on stage and the adrenaline starts pumping , it 's easier to forget.7 . RELAX , the auditor is not out to get you .",1

"Anime and Manga ? What is ur thoughts about Japanesse manga and anime ... Which one do u like best . `` Pokémon is a Anime . '' Well I happen to enjoy both Anime and Manga , though I 've only recently gotten into manga . Personally , my favorite is Ruroni Kenshin , I like the story , the serioussness mixed with comedy , and the overall sadness of the story . My second favorite would have to be Scryed , a fairly new anime . Personally , though , there are very few animes that I do n't like . Cowboy Bebop , Wolf 's Rain , Samurai Champloo , Full Metal Alchemist , Full Metal Panic , Inuyasha , Big O , Soul Hunter , Dragon Ball Z , Gundam ... .all of these are great anime 's and I enjoy each of them . I mainly get my anime from Cartoon Network but I do own a few that are not on Adult Swim . I 've always liked the range of emotions that run throughout most anime , and the over the top action is great as well . There is alot that I enjoy about anime , most of which ca n't be summed up into words : D. The only ones I hate are : Pokemon , Digimon , Yugi-oh , and Reign . I 'm sure there are more but those are the only ones I can remember . Anyway , anime is great , those are my thoughts .",1
"is a mp3 better than an i-pod ? In my opinion , i would think that an MP3 player is better than an iPod . i have several of reasons why.1 . There are pretty much two formats that will work on MP3 players : MP3 and WMA . On iPods , you can only download one format that you ca n't actually listen to on your computer.2 . For an iPod , you have to buy music off an online store . for an MP3 player , if you own the music , you can put it on the MP3 player.3 . iPods tend to cost WAY more than MP3 players.4 . the only reason why iPods are more popular is because that they have good ads and word of mouth got around fast.so , if you are only going to be using it for listening to music , an MP3 player would be better . Likewise , there are things that an iPod can do that others ca n't . iPods generally hold a lot more songs than MP3 players . also , the new iPods can download videos onto them , so you can actually watch music videos on your iPod ! you can also look at picture slideshows on your iPod as well.so , in conclusion if you do n't want to spend as much and you only want to listen to music , choose an MP3 player . if you want to view music videos and pictures , choose an iPod.hope i helped !",1

"Why does TV always show gangsters and thugs holding pistols sideways ? Why does TV always show gangsters and thugs holding pistols sideways instead of the proper vertical orientation ? Is it just for the `` cool '' factor ? The same reason they hold microphones clear to the top thereby losing much of the useful pickup characteristics designed into the microphone . One person does it and someone thinks it 's cool then the next one does it and so on . Nevermind the fact that the sideways orientation of the firearm makes accuracy nearly impossible and kickback from the firearm dangerous , not to mention ejected hot shell casings will fly up into your face and go down your shirt that is cooly unbuttoned . How about the baggy pants that make running impossible , or the light up tennis shoes that make it easy for a police officer to follow a perp in the dark . Much of `` cool '' fashion is so foolish it 's laughable . I still have n't even figured out why the vocalists keep grabbing their crotch area then pointing at the audience while taking giant steps sideways . What is the most absurd about all of this is that all of the people following in lockstep repeating all of this crap are convinced that they are rugged individualists expressing their own unique personality . In reality they are simply reflecting what they have seen on the big glass brain stealer ( That 's TV ) . Well I got ta go now . It 's time for me to put on my stocking cap . Man will I be glad when that craze passes , it 's so hot I ca n't stand it , but what the heck at least I look hip and it hides my bald spot . Peace out.Just read the answer from `` Uchaboo '' That is the stupidest thing I 've ever heard . The orientation of the gun does nothing to affect the flight of the bullet other than make it difficult to aim . Please tell me why you think a bullet fired from a sideways gun would act differently than a bullet fired from a gun held correctly ? Maybe they should hold it upside down so it will fly out backwards and the flat back end of the bullet leave a bigger hole ?",1
"which is a good album to start on the beatles ? i 've loved all of the beatles songs i 've heard so far and want to buy an album , but there 's so many and they 're all good ! which do i start with ? If you are a true beginner , the album `` One '' has all their Number One hits , and covers their career throughout . It serves as a good survey.If you think you will eventually get all their albums maybe you do n't want a greatest hits album like `` One . '' In that case I 'd think about what period Beatles you like the best and pick one of the following : `` Meet The Beatles '' ( very early ) ; `` Rubber Soul '' ( middle peroid , where things start to get more complicated ; `` Abbey Road '' ( late Beatles -- mix of stuff . ) In some ways Sgt . Pepper is considered their best , but much of that is beacuse of its historical significance , its psychedelia , and its sort-of theme album status -- all of which I think are less important today than at the time . To me , it has fewer great songs and is a bit harder to get into . But you ca n't go wrong with any choice .",1

"Who do you like better Green Day or Linkin Park ? I like Linkin Park . Linkin Park and Green Day ( exept for the album `` American Idiot '' ) are pretty much all I listen to . Here 's why I like Linkin Park the best : > No cussing ( the s-word was on the song `` High Voltage '' , but that 's still not as much as Green Day ) . > The lyrics are much deeper , by far. > The music videos are very creative > So far , Linkin Park has n't had to do any covers of old songs to use as filler on albums , whereas Green Day has done , like , 10. > The musicians themselves are interesting and well rounded people . Mr. Hahn directs the videos , Mike draws/creates album art and can play piano and guitar , as well as write great songs and do his thing as emcee , Phoenix can play violin and cello as well as do his thing as bassist for the band.On , a personal bias , Linkin Park is better because they are ! Plus , they have Chester Bennington . He has a huge vocal range ( whispering > whining > singing > shouting > screaming ) , and could probably sing a song from any musical genre . Of course , he 's a complete psyco , but that makes him an interesting person . And , I can completely relate to some of their songs ( which sometimes freaks me out , on certain songs ) . Also , the songs are louder and more in-your-face than Green Day 's . Sometimes , I like to kick back with a little bit of Green Day , because they 're my second favorite band ( although I ca n't explain why ... ) .",1

First Produced 1986 Eugene O'Neill Theater Center , Waterford , CT , USA > > > Published 1989 Dramatist Play Service , NY Genre Comic Folktale Parts Male 2 Female 3 Other Synopsis : Huey Maximilian Bonfigliano has a problem : While he is safely divorced from his shrewish first wife , Janice , who shot his dog and even took a bead on him , he feels he can not regain his `` manhood '' until he woos and wins her one more timeif only to put his broken marriage behind him once and for all . He enlists the aid of his lifelong buddy , Aldo Scalicki , a confirmed bachelor who tries , without apparent success , to convince Huey that he would be better off sticking with his new lady friend , Teresa , a usually placid young waitress whose indignation flares when she learns what Huey is up to . In a moonlit balcony scene ( hilariously reminiscent of Cyrano de Bergerac ) Aldo pleads his lovesick friend 's case and , to his astonishment , Janice capitulatesalthough not for long . However we do learn that her earlier abuse of Huey was intended to make him `` act like a man '' which , at last , he does . And , more than that , he ( and the audience ) become aware that , in the final essence , `` the greatestand onlysuccess is to be able to love '' a truth which emerges delightfully from the heartwarming , wonderfully antic and always imaginatively conceived action of the play .",1

I 've heard in various places that the Space Cadets reality TV show on Channel 4 in the UK is actually performed entirely by actors , notably on Radio 1 yesterday morning.The show openly admits there are some actors there , but I find it hard to believe that none of them are genuine . The premise of the show is a group of people are told they are being sent to space , and placed in an incredibly realistic simulator for 5 days . The claims against it state the whole programme is a trick on the viewing public ... any ideas guys ? Find out more about the show at http : //www.Channel4.co.uk/SpaceCadets There was an article by one of the programme producers in The Guardian recently , which included his admission that they planted some people , but also explained the selection criteria for the victims.You could argue the article itself could be part of the hoax on us , but I think a national newspaper would be careful to avoid getting egg on their faces by being sucked into it like that , particularly given the controversy about the programme .

"Can you give me a overview of Memoirs of Geisha ? From Library Journal '' I was n't born and raised to be a Kyoto geisha ... .I 'm a fisherman 's daughter from a little town called Yoroido on the Sea of Japan . '' How nine-year-old Chiyo , sold with her sister into slavery by their father after their mother 's death , becomes Sayuri , the beautiful geisha accomplished in the art of entertaining men , is the focus of this fascinating first novel . Narrating her life story from her elegant suite in the Waldorf Astoria , Sayuri tells of her traumatic arrival at the Nitta okiya ( a geisha house ) , where she endures harsh treatment from Granny and Mother , the greedy owners , and from Hatsumomo , the sadistically cruel head geisha . But Sayuri 's chance meeting with the Chairman , who shows her kindness , makes her determined to become a geisha . Under the tutelage of the renowned Mameha , she becomes a leading geisha of the 1930s and 1940s . After the book 's compelling first half , the second half is a bit flat and overlong . Still , Golden , with degrees in Japanese art and history , has brilliantly revealed the culture and traditions of an exotic world , closed to most Westerners . Highly recommended.- ? Wilda Williams , `` Library Journal '' According to Arthur Golden 's absorbing first novel , the word `` geisha '' does not mean `` prostitute , '' as Westerners ignorantly assume -- it means `` artisan '' or `` artist . '' To capture the geisha experience in the art of fiction , Golden trained as long and hard as any geisha who must master the arts of music , dance , clever conversation , crafty battle with rival beauties , and cunning seduction of wealthy patrons . After earning degrees in Japanese art and history from Harvard and Columbia -- and an M.A . in English -- he met a man in Tokyo who was the illegitimate offspring of a renowned businessman and a geisha . This meeting inspired Golden to spend 10 years researching every detail of geisha culture , chiefly relying on the geisha Mineko Iwasaki , who spent years charming the very rich and famous.The result is a novel with the broad social canvas ( and love of coincidence ) of Charles Dickens and Jane Austen 's intense attention to the nuances of erotic maneuvering . Readers experience the entire life of a geisha , from her origins as an orphaned fishing-village girl in 1929 to her triumphant auction of her mizuage ( virginity ) for a record price as a teenager to her reminiscent old age as the distinguished mistress of the powerful patron of her dreams . We discover that a geisha is more analogous to a Western `` trophy wife '' than to a prostitute -- and , as in Austen , flat-out prostitution and early death is a woman 's alternative to the repressive , arcane system of courtship . In simple , elegant prose , Golden puts us right in the tearoom with the geisha ; we are there as she gracefully fights for her life in a social situation where careers are made or destroyed by a witticism , a too-revealing ( or not revealing enough ) glimpse of flesh under the kimono , or a vicious rumor spread by a rival `` as cruel as a spider . '' Golden 's web is finely woven , but his book has a serious flaw : the geisha 's true romance rings hollow -- the love of her life is a symbol , not a character . Her villainous geisha nemesis is sharply drawn , but she would be more so if we got a deeper peek into the cause of her motiveless malignity -- the plight all geisha share . Still , Golden has won the triple crown of fiction : he has created a plausible female protagonist in a vivid , now-vanished world , and he gloriously captures Japanese culture by expressing his thoughts in authentic Eastern metaphors.Amazon",1

"When is the best time to go to disney world ? This is my response to a similar question : This depends on what you are looking for as far as the best time . Christmas time is one of the most beautiful times of the year . Each resort is decorated for Christmas and the decorations are beautiful . If you go during this time you have to visit the resorts . They have a carousel made out of chocolate , a a very large gingerbread house and other amazing things . Plus , the christmas trees are beautiful as well . Also , the whether is nicer . Usually it will run in the low 70s during the day . If you are near the water it is a little cold and windy , but not too bad . Also , the parades in the park are themed for Christmas and very nice to see . However , if you have never been to Disney , you may want to see the regular parades . The crowds can be bad , but I have gone several times during Christmas and it is a great time of the year to go . I highly recommend staying away from the time around July 4 . During this time almost all of the parks will close due to capacity . So lines are extremely long and it is terrible to try to get around . Also , it is very hard . Combine the large crowds and the heat and it can be misserable . You will not have as much fun if it is this hot and crowded as you would otherwise . however , the fireworks during this time are spectacular and will not dissapoint . But you have to wait a long time in order to see them from a good location.I usually prefer going after school has started . September/October is a great time . The weather is nice , crowds are n't and big as the other times of the year . If you go in value season you can save yourself some money . Keep in mind , Disney will often do refurbishments during this time because it is not as busy , so some attractions may be closed while you are there . But it easy to find this out ahead of time . Also , if you go in October you can go to Mickey 's not so scary halloween . This is a must see if you go during this time . The park is closed early that day and you have to have another ticket to get in . But there is a fraction of the people in the park . There are rides open and you basically walk right on . It is nice to be there when it is n't as busy and it is really neat as well . Plus , if you have kids , it is more kid friendly than the Universal Halloween party.So you need to think about what you prefer and then take your vacation at that time of year .",1

"When buying DVD Movies , what is the difference between full frame and wide screen movies ? The difference is due to something called `` aspect ratio '' . Widescreen movies have a 16:9 aspect ratio , meaning that they are more rectangular than square in the shape of the screen ( the screen is wider than regular , hence the term `` widescreen '' ) . The difference in the picture is that with widescreen , you see more on the edges of the picture . For instance , if there were 100 trees in a shot , with full frame you might only see 70 of them because the edges are cut off a bit . To me , this makes a difference in the movie , but not so much that you would have a different understanding of the film . Moving forward , I would say that you should buy your movies in 16:9 or widescreen format because more and more TV 's are now in that format .",1

"What is the best way to develop my piano technique to play pop/rock songs ? I know chords , inversions , etc. , but how do I make what I do with my left hand more interesting ( I tend to just play octaves ) ? Are there any good books/courses that you could recommend ? Well I just started learning jazz piano in the fall to accompany my singing . I actually learned some good rhythm patterns for the standards so far , I know they arent pop or rock songs , but it might help.Some suggestions : In the left hand you can play the root tone ( C7 it would be C ) and then the 5th note ( G ) alternating . So like on the first beat C and then on the 3 beat G. To make it more interesting play the C on the 1 and the 2.5 ( leading to the G ) and then the G on the 3 and 4.5 . ( I usually do that on swing songs , so you play the offbeats right before the next beat so it has that swing feel ) You play the chord in the right hand on the 1 and 3 . ( or in swing songs sometimes on the 1.5 or you play the chord on the 4.5 of the measure before ) Also for the left hand you can think of a bass line , which is a little more complicated . Where you play bass notes on each note according to the chord and you lead it to the next chord . I believe that the notes on 1 and 3 should be in the chord . Im not very good at that yet , so I cant really say much more about bass lines.For bossa ( or a latin feel ) , you play the left hand like my first example but in a straight feel . Then you play the chord in the right hand on the 1 ( 1/8note ) 2 ( dotted 1/4 ) 3+ ( 1/4note ) Another suggestions is to listen carefully to music you like and hear what they are playing . Try putting up the bass and figure out what they are playing exactly in the bass . Then analyze the chords , try playing along . It takes some time and effort but will help develop your hearing and make you a better musician . It might help to get an experienced musician to give you lessons . I would suggest going to jam sessions and finding a piano player you like and ask he/she if they would give you lessons . I really learned a lot in a short time with the help of guided lessons . ( I know some other patterns as well , but they are difficult to explain in a forum , it helps to see and hear them in person . )",1

"What is Raggaetone ? Reggaeton is a form of dance music which has become popular with Latin America in youth during the late 1990s and has spread to North American and European audiences during the first few years of the 21st century . Reggaeton ( also spelled with the Spanish accent as Reggaetón , and sometimes as Reguetón in Spanish ) - blends Jamaican music influences of reggae and dancehall with those of Latin America , such as bomba and plena , as well as that of hip hop . The music is combined with rapping ( generally ) in Spanish . Reggaeton has empowered the Spanish Caribbean youth , specifically those of Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic , as well as the Latin American and United States Latino communities , with a musical genre as a voice . More recently it has become an international movement with the help of many from New York 's Latino and Black hip hop community.While it takes influences from hip hop and dancehall , it would be wrong to define reggaeton as the 'Spanish'- or 'Latino'- version of either of these genres ; reggaeton has its own specific beat and rhythm , whereas Latino hip hop is simply hip hop sung by artists of Latino descent . Reggaeton 's distinguishing feature is the Dem Bow beat ( alternately spelled Dembow ) , which originated in a song by Shabba Ranks in the mid-1990s.Reggaeton lyrics tend to be more derived from hip hop than dancehall . Like hip hop , reggaeton has caused controversy due to its often explicit lyrics and alleged exploitation of women [ 1 ] . Further controversy surrounds perreo , a dance with explicit sexual overtones which typically accompanies reggaeton music",1

"what do you think about eurotrip ? I think Eurotrip is a great comedy and I take it like that - not to seriously . The fact is that it 's a lot misleading . Even though they travelled through the whole Europe , almost the entire movie has been shot in Prague , Czech Republic . But the worst thing was the part where they visited Slovak Republic and Bratislava . I come from Slovakia and the whole image of the country in Eurotrip was very insulting . It looked like the country is still in middle ages . And the fact that they lived in luxury and comfort for one or two dollars is a total bullshit . Bratislava is one of the most expensive cities in Central Europe and in the entire EU . For two dollars you would not even get a coffee in the downtown . And that kind of hotel they staid in would cost about $ 100 dollars per one night or more . My point is that when someone presents our country in such way it really hurts us since it 's miles from the truth . People should know what they are putting inside of the movie and be very careful with that since they are risking the whole public opinion on the country . Slovakia is a member of Europian Union with the fastest growing economy . By two years it will be the largest car producer per capita in the whole world and according to the World Bank it was rated as the most reformed contry in the year 2004 .

Too young to be cast as leading lady , she started with bit roles only , but was not missed , and quickly graduated to lead roles in low budget movies . She was extremely versatile , beautiful , charming , and stole everybody 's heart by her captivating looks and inspired performances in each of her film . She quickly out-shadowed and dethroned the established queens in a very short time because of her histrionics . Mumtaz was sensitive , quick to understand and translate every nuance hinted at , onto the screen . Even in her brief roles against established actresses , she was the one who got noticed more and lingered in viewers memories for longer periods . She acted in more than 100 films during a short career span of 14 years , and there is not even a single film in which her performance could not be termed as excellent . In her very first film with significant banner and role , Khilona ( 1970 ) , she won the most coveted Filmfare award in 1970 . She has also been awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by Filmfare in 1997 . She was in the Marilyn Monroe mould ; every man 's fantasy woman . She outshone everybody because of the simple reason that she was so versatile that every role appeared as if it was written with just Mumtaz in mind . Whether the role was negative or positive , serious or light , she proved her worth . Whether the role was for an urbanite or rustic , majestic or pauper , innocent or vile , gentle or venomous , coy or flaunting , Mumtaz just fitted them like a glove . The public adulation for her is still strong . The response to the continuous spate of screening of her movies on various television channels , even after more than two decades of her self-retirement , proves her tremendous unending popularity due to her incomparable charisma .",1

Clark agreed knowing that someone close to him might die . Clark knowingly was sent back in time to avoid the same thing from happening , but in the end his father died of a heart attack .

I think the opposite , some of the special effect sequences ( which were great ) could be removed . The story of this movie is more about the relationship between the characters and the ape , not so much an action flick.I can see why Jackson did it that way though . For a movie to be financially successful it generally has to do well in the US market . The US movie-goer is very hooked on action and special effects , so that had to be in there along side the emotional story in order for it to be liked in the US .",1

"what is the begining of israel and palastine conflict ? why could n't it be stopped ? Complex problems usually do n't have simple answers ( like 'they tried to throw the Palestinians out ) .For over 3,000 years , Jews have held the Land of Israel to be their homeland , both as a Holy Land and as a Promised Land . The Land of Israel holds a special place in Jewish religious obligations , encompassing Judaism 's most important sites — including the remains of the First and Second Temple , as well as the rites concerning those temples . [ 2 ] Starting around 1200 BCE , a series of Jewish kingdoms and states existed intermittently in the region for over a millennium . Recent archeological evidence suggests that the kingdoms of King David and King Solomon may have existed . [ 3 ] Under Babylonian , Greek , Roman , Byzantine , and ( briefly ) Sassanian rule , Jewish presence in the province dwindled due to mass expulsions . In particular , the failure of the Bar Kochba Revolt against the Roman Empire resulted in widescale expulsion of Jews . It was during this time that the Romans gave the name Syria Palaestina to the geographic area , in an attempt to erase Jewish ties to the land . The Mishnah and Jerusalem Talmud , two of Judaism 's most important religious texts , were composed in the region during this period . The Arabs conquered the land from the Eastern Roman Empire in 638 CE . The area was ruled by various Arab states ( interrupted by the rule of the Crusaders ) before becoming part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517.Throughout the centuries , the size of the Jewish population in the land fluctuated widely . Circa 1881 , in the region approximating present-day Israel , the Jewish population numbered approximately 20–25,000 of a total population of 470,000 . [ citation needed ] Since 1844 , in Jerusalem the Jews have constituted the largest of several ethno-religious groups . [ citation needed ] By 1896 , they were an absolute majority of the populationThe rise of Nazism in 1933 led to a fifth wave of Aliyah . The Jews in the region increased from 11 % of the population in 1922 to 30 % by 1940 . The subsequent Holocaust in Europe led to additional immigration from other parts of Europe . By the end of World War II , the number of Jews in Palestine was approximately 600,000.In 1939 , the British abandoned the idea of a Jewish national home , and abandoned partition and negotiations in favour of the White Paper of 1939 , which limited Jewish immigration and restricted purchase of land by Jews . Its other stated policy was to establish a system under which both Jews and Arabs were to share one government . The plan was never fully implemented because of a combination of resistance from the Jews and Arabs and Britain 's pre-occupation with Europe and World War II . However , the White Paper guided British policy until the end of the term of their Mandate . As a result , many Jews fleeing to Palestine to avoid Nazi persecution and the holocaust were intercepted and returned to Europe . Two specific examples of this policy involved the ships Struma and Exodus [ 4 ] . These attempts by Jews to circumvent the blockade and flee Europe became known as Aliya Beth.In 1947 , following increasing levels of violence by militant groups together with unsuccessful efforts to reconcile the Jewish and Arab populations , the British government decided to withdraw from the Palestine Mandate . The UN General Assembly approved the 1947 UN Partition Plan dividing the territory into two states , Jewish and Arab , giving about half the land area to each state . Jerusalem was planned to be an international region administered by the UN to avoid conflict over its status.Immediately following the adoption of the Partition Plan by the UN General Assembly ( on November 29 , 1947 ) , the Arab leadership rejected the plan and launched a guerilla war that included attacks on Jewish civilians . The Irgun Tsvai Leumi retaliated with attacks on Arabs , including Arab civilians.On May 14 , 1948 , before the expiry of the British Mandate of Palestine at midnight of May 15 , 1948 ,",0

Glaucoma is symptom less and gradually steals your vision without warning , but can be detected by a simple test usually performed during a routine vision exam .

Others , specially politicians , say it was stolen by the US . That all really depends on your definition of `` stole . '' Technically , the Mexican government signed the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo , ceding all of the territories to which you refer in exchange for $ 15 million and ending the Mexican-American War . One could say , however , that the Mexican-American War was merely a pretext for taking all of the territory , and it is likely not far from the truth . Also , a large chunk of Arizona and a section of New Mexico were purchased after the stealing of the rest in 1853 as the Gadsden Purchase , in which the US paid Mexico $ 10 million , about $ 343,826,098 accounting for inflation .",0

"How to put in color ink from an ink installation kit ? I have a Lexmark Z611 printer and I have an emty ink cartridge but I have this kit were I can put more ink into it but I do n't know exactly were to drill the holes to put in some more color ink . Can someone help me ? Your cartridge needs to have the top popped in order to refill . HOWEVER , make sure the cartridge has not been run empty , or it will not respond to refilling . Also if you have removed the cartridge and it is just sitting on your desk , then it will not respond either . The printhead needs to be kept damp , or protected . The last thing you need to know is that you MUST have lexmark 10n0026 ink . If you bought one of the universal kits , you may be stuck with ink that is too thin and will leak , or ink that is too thick and will clog.Once you determine that all is OK , simply use a knife to pry off the top of the cartridge , and if you can not tell which color goes where , use a tooth pick to determine which color is where . these are small cartridges and will not require much ink , so fill very slowly . Watch the printhead and the top of the cartridge at the same time . At the first sign of ink coming from the print head - STOP and pull back a bit on the needle ( a very little bit ) . You should also watch the top of the cartridge , as to avoid having the ink pour out of the top . Repeat for all colors . Hope this helps.If you have to remove the cartridge prior to refilling , then you should place it in a zipper bag along with a slightly damp paper towel , until you can get to it . It must remain moist , but not wet , and do not store in the freezer .",0
"is there any care or prevention for demintia or alzymers disease ? I have heard that using your brain more can help delay or prevent Alzheimers , though not scientifically proven . Puzzles like Mensa , Soduku , brain teasers may help.Efforts to find effective treatments for Alzheimer 's after-the-fact have so far been disappointing . Age is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer 's . The baby boom is approaching its golden years . Indeed , much of the concern about the solvency of governmental social safety nets is founded on estimates of the costs of caring for baby boomers , assuming that they develop Alzheimer 's in the same proportions as earlier generations.One study ( `` Leisure Activities and the Risk of Dementia in the Elderly , '' New England Journal of Medicine [ 8 ] ) found that people who played chess on a regular basis went on to get Alzheimer 's at a substantially lower rate than the general population . The chess relationship was stronger than any other factor , including dancing and solving crossword puzzles , both of which were also shown to be inversely proportional to getting Alzheimer 's disease.In a number of retrospective studies , regular physical exercise has appeared to be inversely related to the development of Alzheimer ’ s . The Alzheimer 's risk of those exercising regularly was half that of the least active . This research is consistent with the observation that virtually all measures designed to promote cardiac fitness and reduce stroke risk also seem to reduce Alzheimer 's risk . However in one study , dance appeared to be the only exercise effective in reducing risk . One explanation is that dancing requires the use of complex mental skills such as performing correct steps while at the same time keeping track of the music . The presence of cardiovascular risk factors -- diabetes , hypertension , high cholesterol and smoking -- in middle age ( ages 40 to 44 ) was found very strongly associated with late-life dementia ( Neurology 2005 ; 64:277-281 . PMID 15668425 ) .",0

My verdict : The new Yahoo Mail is far superior to Gmail . Yahoo more closely matches the desktop experience most serious email users have come to expect ... .and PC Magazine saying : ... there 's no question that Yahoo ! is set to make a big leap forward with its new Web-based mail product . We 'll hold off on a rating until the official release or at least the full public beta , but from what we 've seen and tested so far , Yahoo ! 's competition may soon have some serious catching up to do ... .and the AP saying : Overall , I find Yahoo easier to use , and it 's quite impressive for a product that 's only weeks old . I expect even more features by the time a final version is released.Well , I figured that the cat was pretty well out of the bag : the new Yahoo ! Mail kicks a lot of ass . For lots of people out there , it 's going to be the first web-based replacement for Outlook or Outlook express they 've ever seen.And it 's got some serious `` WOW '' factor going for it . I still remember when Ethan turned on my access a few months ago . I was at home packing for my trip to Parowan when he gave me the URL . The interface loaded up and I just thought ... wow ! It was slower back then and has some bugs but it was already clear that it was going to move expectations up a level or two.Oh , and if you look at that screenshot , you 'll see that there are over 42,000 messages in my inbox . The product still works well with a big volume of mail.Now stop asking when I 'm gon na write about it ! : - ) BTW , It is a closed beta right now but that should change soon . In the meantime I 've asked the Yahoo ! Mail team if I could give out a few `` invites '' so faithful readers could try it out . No response yet , so no promises . But let me know if you think you could really use it ...",0

"Is it possible to continue to move forward and never reach a destination ? Example , if I draw a dot 10 spaces apart from each other , I begin at point A and move one full space towards point B ( now 9 full spaces away , but on every next move I take 1/2 of my previous move , i.e . after the next move point B is 8 1/2 spaces away . If I continue the movements at 1/2 increments of my proevious move , I am still moving forward but theoretically I never reach my destination which is a fixed point . Is that correct ? Does that mean that there are an infinite amount of numbers between 1 & 2 ? What you are describing is an infinite series using a decreasing geometric progression . The sum of such a series can be described by this proof : Let T = total distance traveled ( in spaces ) Then T = 1 + ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ... Also T - 1 = ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ... And if we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:2* ( T - 1 ) = 2* ( ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ... ) Multiplying through:2T - 2 = 1 + ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ... But the Right side is the same as T ! 2T - 2 = TSimplifying : T = 2So the total distance traveled is 2 spaces .",0

"What are the odds of a man catching HIV while having unprotected sex ( oral and vaginally ) ? What are the odds of a man catching HIV while having unprotected sex ( oral and vaginally ) with a woman who is HIV positive or AIDS . How do those odds change over time ? In other words , one sexual encounter versus multiple ? The following numbers are old , and they 're all pretty much guesswork anyway , so take them with a grain of salt . But I venture to say most people in the field would agree with my conclusions.According to a report by researchers Norman Hearst and Stephen Hulley in the Journal of the American Medical Association , the odds of a heterosexual becoming infected with AIDS after one episode of penile-vaginal intercourse with someone in a non-high-risk group without a condom are one in 5 million . With a condom it 's even safer -- one in 50 million . Just to put this in perspective , the chances of someone in your family getting injured next year in a bubble bath are 1 in 1.3 million ( source : The Odds on Virtually Everything , Heron House , 1980 ) . You 're in much greater danger of being struck by lightning ( 1 in 600,000 ) , having your house bombed ( 1 in 290,000 ) , or being murdered ( 1 in 11,000 ) .The numbers get a lot worse if you engage in `` high-risk behavior '' -- having sexual intercourse or sharing needles with a member of a high-risk group , e.g. , a gay or bisexual male or IV drug user from a major metro area , or a hemophiliac . The chances of getting AIDS from one such encounter range as high as 1 in 10,000 using a condom to 1 in 1,000 unprotected . Even if your partner tests negative for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , the chances of infection from a high-risk person are still relatively high -- 1 in 50,000 without a condom . That 's because there 's a 45 to 90 day window during which a newly infected person can infect others but test negative . ( A few people go as long as 180 days . ) From there on out , statistically speaking , things deteriorate pretty fast . If your partner is HIV-positive , your chances of getting AIDS after one night are 1 in 5,000 with a condom , 1 in 500 without . Have sex with an HIV-positive partner 500 times using condoms and your chances escalate to 1 in 11 . Skip the gift wrap and they 're 2 in 3.A couple points : These odds apply equally to men and women . Although there 's reason to believe male-to-female AIDS transmission happens more often than female-to-male , the amount of difference is unknown . Also , I have to emphasize again , the numbers involve a lot of guesswork . The authors admit they could be off by a factor of ten in either direction . Still , one message comes through loud and clear : by far the best thing you can do to avoid AIDS is to be picky about your partners . Use of condoms reduces your risk by a factor of 10 , sleeping only with people who test negative reduces it by a factor of 5 to 50 , but avoiding high-risk partners reduces it by a factor of 5,000 . ( You 'd also be well advised to avoid high-risk behavior , such as unprotected receptive anal sex . ) Asking for a resume may not be romantic , but it beats Kaposi 's sarcoma .",0

"why female breasts are so large compared to other mammals ? if you consider that such a large and chubby organ would be disadvantegous for surviving , how do you explain the evolution of sumptuous female breasts ? i think most of you think that this is associated with breastfeeding . but many mammals breastfeed too , but they dont have such large organs , right ? what is the deal with those nice breasts ? can you figure out what is going on ? There is definitely some severe debate going on concerning this issue . Some have proposed women have prominent breasts as the result of natural or sexual selection . Suggesting since women with large breasts are considered more desirable they would have more suitors and as a result reproduce more often . Others argue that this concept myopic because its based solely on modern Western society 's ideals of what is considered attractive . Those folks would suggest that breast size has seldom been of major importance in most societies . In the majority of societies breasts are just a source of nourishment for infants and young children . Whereas there is a relatively important argument against the latter argument in favor of the former . It would be difficult to believe that there is some `` natural selection '' root for the `` modern western society '' propensity of finding women with large breasts attractive . It would seem unlikely that these sorts of pervasive ideals toward the female form would simply appear out of thin air -- that 's giving Playboy a lot of credit I think.Then minimalistic view of why female breasts become so prominant is that the development of the female breast during puberty is likely the side affect of some biological necessity that is not readily apparent . Perhaps it is simply that human females experience a greater increase in estrogen levels during puberty than do other mammals.I do have to admit that I like the theory mentioned above about the need for larger to prevent suffococation while breast feeding , however , I would reckon that a major contribution to increased breast size may be the increased fatty content of our diet . This may be an explanation for why past cultures did n't have an affinity toward large breasts , because of the lack of high fat content in their diet , there were few women who displayed large breasts . However , because diet was usually a representation of status , there were many female members of aristocracic classes throughout time who were viewed as the most beautiful women of their day . These women tended to be rather Rubenesque . So , maybe it was already engrained in the human race early on.So , it 's not well known the mechanism by which female breasts have become more promenent in comparison to other mamals . Which leads me onece again to my soap box : When it comes to biology/evolution , it 's impossible to answer much of anything when it comes to `` why . '' Things happen for reasons , but very little of -- if any -- biology happens for a reason . Breasts are n't more prominent in the human species when compared to other mammalian species because of any designed reason . It could be that women with bigger breasts are more likely to mate , or mate more often , than women with smaller breasts , maybe it is our diet , whatever the reason that allows for breast sizes to increase , the genetics that allow for this to happen was determined by hundreds of the thousands -- if not millions -- of years of selective pressures that selected these genes as the most fit . These pressures have altered and molded these genes to their current status .",0

"What is the meaning of the English soccer term `` cup-tied '' when applied to an individual player ? Cup-tied is an adjective , used primarily in football ( soccer ) , used to describe a player who is ineligible to play in a knockout cup competition after transferring from another club during that competition.In virtually all domestic and international cup competitions , any player who makes an appearance for a club at any stage of the competition is `` tied '' to that club for all future matches during that season in the same competition . This prevents a strong team from gaining an unfair advantage by signing a talented player from a club that has lost in an earlier round . A team that wishes to transfer a player may deliberately choose to keep that player off its cup roster to ensure that he is not cup-tied , increasing his usefulness to a club that may be involved in the same competition . A recent example of this was Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez ' decision to keep Milan Baroš off Liverpool 's roster for their 2005-06 UEFA Champions League ties in order to retain his value to clubs interested in purchasing the Czech striker 's services . ( Baroš eventually moved to Aston Villa , which was not involved in the Champions League . ) Similarly , although far less often , a team may deliberately cup-tie a player to discourage a transfer during that season . Note , however , that this does not restrict most international transfers ; cup-tying is only an issue internationally if both teams involved in the transfer have participated in a continental cup competition such as the UEFA Champions League or UEFA Cup .",0

"phases of themoon ? The Moon appears to go through phases . In other words , the amount of the Moon that we can see changes over time in a cyclic period that repeats itself approximately once a month . ( The actual period of this cycle is approximately 29.5 Earth days . ) The cause of these phases is the relative positions of the Sun , Earth , and Moon . As seen in the diagram , if the Sun is located off to the right of the picture , the Earth and Moon are illuminated as shown ( the white areas being the lighted areas ) . Notice that no matter what phase the Moon is in , HALF of it is ALWAYS lit by the Sun . ( Which half is always lit ? The half that is facing the Sun . ) The reason that we do not always see a Moon which is half lit is because of our position relative to the Moon and the Sun . As the Moon moves in its orbit , different portions of it appear ( to us ! ) to be lit up as we look at it from Earth . This is why we see lunar phases .",0

So obviously eggs came before chickens by this line of reasoning.Following evolutionary theory , genetics , and the development of embryos , one might argue that again , the egg came before the chicken because the first chicken is a genetic mutation of two chicken like parents . So , from this line of reasoning , you might , again argue the egg if you are talking about first chicken relative to the egg . For the first chicken had to develop inside the egg as the offspring of two chicken-like parents.But then I realized `` Hey , how did the first zygotic chicken ( fertilized ovum ) get inside the egg in the first place ? '' If the ovum was inside an egg shell with yoke and rooster sperm is added afterward , then the egg comes first . But what if the the ovum is fertilized first , then encased in an egg shell ? Then would not the zygotic chicken come before the egg ? A quick look on Wikipedia for bird reproduction indicates that the eggs are fertilized with sperm during the descent from the ovaries through the cloaca . If this is the case , then , again , the egg comes before the chicken.So , I forgot to add one reason people ask this question every six minutes:4 ) Because they have too much time on their hands . : ^ )",0

"Who invented the `` modem '' and when ? Tomlinson invented email in 1972.Digital modems developed from the need to transmit data for North American air defense during the 1950s . Modems were used to communicate data over the public switched telephone network or PSTN . Analog telephone circuits can only transmit signals that are within the frequency range of voice communication . A modem sends and recieves data between two computers . Modem stands for modulate/demodulate.In 1962 , the first commercial modem was manufactured - the Bell 103 by AT & T . The Bell 103 was also the first modem with full-duplex transmission , frequency-shift keying or FSK , and had a speed of 300 bits per second or 300 bauds.The 56K modem was invented by Dr. Brent Townshend in 1996.History of ModemsRobert Lucky invented the automatic adaptive equalizer in 1965 at Bell Laboratories.The Man behind the ModemsBrent Townshend , the man who dreamed up the idea for 56K bit/sec modems.Developer receives patent for PCM modemsBrent Townshend , the Quebec-based developer who worked on several core concepts for pulse-code modulated ( PCM ) modems , received several U.S. patents for that technology .",0

"how are sedimentary rocks formed ? ? how are sedimentary rocks formed ? ? Sedimentary rocks can be divided into two major informal groups , referred to as clastics ( or siliciclastics ) and carbonates . Clastic rocks are formed by erosion of other rocks , igneous , metamorphic and sedimentary . These 'clasts ' can be mud , silt , sand , cobbles , or boulders , and are transported by wind , water , or gravity and accumulate where they eventually are buried and pressure and temperature subject them to diagenesis , the process that makes them from unconsolidated clasts to one rock mass . Shale , sandstone , and conglomerate are examples of clastics.Carbonates can work much differently since they form primarily in the oceans . Many carbonates are made from reefs and other living organisms that grow in the ocean . As these organisms die and leave behind their carbonate skeletons , rocks are formed . Other carbonates are formed from small grains called ooids , small balls that form by precipitating out of sea water , possibly with the help of bacteria or algae . Some ocean algae even form carbonate 'mud ' that eventually becomes hard rock . Another unusual group of sedimentary rocks are called evaporites . These are rocks like gypsum and rock salt that are deposited by evaporation of water in confined basins . The most fascinating part about sedimentary rocks is that they have a past , each one tells a story .",0

"Definitions ? please ! ? Please describe the following and how the 're usedResource-Oil -Natural Gas-Coal-Water-Wood- In the context of your question , A resource is a source of material or energy that may be consumed , changed , or dispersed to the point it is no longer easily usable . Examples would be copper ore , oxygen in the atmosphere , helium gas taken from oil wells , water , sand , or even soil . Anything we do consumes or utilizes some sort of resource . Breathing uses oxygen from the air . Copper is used for wiring and piping . Helium is used for scientific research and birthday balloons . Sand is used to make concrete . Water is used for drinking , irrigation , and generating hydroelectric power . Soil is used for growing crops . None of these are exhaustive lists , just examples . Oil : Oil is a mixture of organic compounds extracted from the earth by drilling . It is created from organic materials deposited in sedimentary rock that are altered by heat , pressure , and biotic processes to create it . Oil is used to make gasoline , diesel , airplane fuel , plastic , shampoo , rubber , antihistamines , and many other products . Natural gas : It is an organic gas that is also extracted from the earth by drilling . It is generated by a similar process to that for oil generation . It is used to heat homes , make fertilizer , and some plastics . Water : Water is found in many forms , but mostly as either fresh or saltwater . Fresh water is used for drinking , irrigation , etc . Saltwater is not as useful directly to man , but is an essential part of our environment as the oceans both support food supplies and have a large effect on the climate . Wood : Wood comes from living organisms- trees . Wood can be used for building many things , including houses . It is used for fuel and is the primary source of fuel in some parts of the world .",0

How do I prevent this ? Use WPA instead of WEP if your router is older and does n't have wpa then use WEP . Secondly , of course change the password on the router itself . Next , change the default ssid and change it so that the ssid is not broadcast . Finally , set it up so that only certain MAC address are able to access the network ( yourself included : ) ) . You really should do all these things to make your home network secure , you really should n't pick and choose .",0

They will be your ... `` Bible '' , from now on ! * Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads . Also ognion + garlic . * Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits ( whenever possible , of course ) * If you really want a book , then check this out : The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook ( Win95/98 only ) . Read more about this e-book here.• Eat fish , chicken , beef , pork . ( preferences are in this order ) * If you are a vegetarian , then ignore this ! * Avoid fat meat• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day . Do n't EVER exclude bread from your diet ! • Snacks between meals ( if needed ) : apples , oranges , grepfruits and other NC fruits* Do n't cheat ... NO cookies , chips , candies , brownies etc ! * EVEN if they have `` low fat '' indication ... They might have low fat , yet they can have lots of CALORIES ! ! ! • About rice , potatoes , beans , [ xxx ] nuts , pastry , pasta ... you know ! * Do n't eat too much of those , at least during the first weeks of the diet . I 'm not a low carb addict , but I 've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities , especially when associated with other foods . * If you like them a lot , try and eat them like one meal . A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch ( never dinner ! ) , followed by a nice big apple . These rich starch foods are not good for dinner ! * At dinner time , chose mainly large mixed veggies salads ... with fish , lean meat or cheese ( if you are not a vegetarian ) . if u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it . no salt no nothing just plain . u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound . i heard that from a weight loss tape . the best drink is water or gatorade . thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo . if u want a macine . run with dumbells on a treadmill . u could do the rocky workout . but thats a new story . u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs1 ) It is not just the amount you eat , but what you eat . Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start . And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.2 ) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day . Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored . The other half of the time use weights , or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle `` burn '' . A gym is also an option , but I do n't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.3 ) Sleep well . To bed earlier and up earlier . Exercise in the morning when you wake up , not in the evening before bed . 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.4 ) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time . A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.That is a good place to start ... if you see good results , keep it up and modify to fit you ... if it does not , see a doctor AND a trainer Keep working out , drink water a lot , eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities , vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice , fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours , minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important , your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hoursthe most important thing is you do n't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you wantyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.comgood luck",0

A compression wrap should be worn for the first 24 to 36 hours.Also , try soaking it in hot water and epsom salts . I sprained both of mine playing football .",0

"Should the Phil . invest money donated by western countrries on developing on agri . area 's into industr'l zone ? *Economic Impact*Social and physiological needs*psychological impact*Advantage and disadvantage Investing money to develop agricultural areas into industrial zones is good -- -partly though.First of all , the Philippines is an agricultural nation . Perhaps some agricultural areas should be developed , but not all . Since it is an agricultural nation , it derives its economy from agriculture . If these areas will be developed into industrial zones , a good part of the economy will be crippled.Second , people who depend on agriculture for a living will lost their jobs . If their skills are only limited to agriculture , where will they go once these areas are industrialized ? Lastly , and this is just my opinion , if agricultural areas will be turned into industrial zones , and considering that the money comes from Western countries , the Philippines will then have a debt of gratitude to these nations . Meaning , its government will do whatever these nations will tell them to do . Another form of colonization , eh ? Industrialization is not bad as long as it is done with responsibility -- -which I doubt the Philippine government has . Yeah , I am disillusioned . I 'm a Filipino too .",0

"Should I buy step-in snowboard bindings ? I used these before and really liked them , but a few friends told me not to buy them . But I like the convenience ! it 's all personal preference . Step in 's were the bomb in about 98 . One thing to notice is that not many companies make true `` step-in 's '' nowadays . Burton has a hybrid binding called the Fusion . It looks like a regular strap binding , but the straps are on a frame that can detach from the base plate . It 's hard to explain but really kool.Flows are the other main choice . The back flips down and you slide your boot in . It 's quick but i do n't know if the single top piece would cause pressure points.K2 also has a binding where the back drops down , very similar to Flows . Personally , i 'd say no to step ins and yes to a very comfortable strap binding . The time you `` save '' stepping in will just be wasted waiting for your friends to strap in .",0

If you become skilled in golf , it will undoubtedly provide a lifetime of satisfaction as well as numerous social and business contacts . Golf also presents the opportunity to learn a different set of skills . It requires patience , emotional control , an emphasis on sportsmanship , and the ability to be self-reliant . All of these skills help in other areas of your life , as well as in other sports .

"I am preparing a speech on the importance of faith in God , can anyone tell me why they believe ? THE REASON FOR MY QUESTION IS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT GOD EXISTS , THE PROOF IS ALL AROUND US . AND YET THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO REFUSE TO GIVE GOD THE PRAISE HE DESERVES , CAN ANYONE SHARE AS TO WHY THEY BELIEVE AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO GIVE ANY TESTIMONIES YOU MAY HAVE . I AM PRESENTING A SPEECH IN MY PUBLIC SPEAKING CLASS ON HOW IMPORTANT BELIEVING GOD IS AND I WOULD LOVE TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS FROM REAL EVERYDAY PEOPLE THAT LOVE CHRIST JUST AS I DO . THANK YOU . I became a Christian when I was 14 . My grandma was living with us and had Alzheimer 's disease . There was a lot of fighting in my family . I was watching TBN and Jan Crouch invited me to give my life to Christ . She said that God wants to take me from where I am and do something amazing with my life . I just have to trust Him . So right then and there I bowed my head and asked Christ into my heart.Since then , God has done amazing things in my life . Today , I 'm a college graduate and will be pursuing a Master 's degree in Special Education . I was on my college newspaper and won a first place award in the entire state for my Opinion writing . I give all the glory to God for my accomplishments.God even rescued me from a cult . I joined a cult when I was in college , and my spirit began to cry out for God . Late at night , I went to the Christian church where I 'd been baptized originally . The ( huge ) church was completely empty as far as I could tell , but I saw a light under one door . I put my hand on the door handle , opened the door , went in and prayed with the pastor in there . After that I became active in the church again and seeing me later the pastor told me that the door I 'd walked through was acutally locked -- he checked after I left , but I 'd opened it like it was open . I know a miracle happened there and God opened the door for me.On an intellectual level , I 've come to understand that God is more real than we have ever imagined . I 've read books such as `` More than a Carpenter '' by Josh McDowell , `` The Case for Faith '' by Lee Strobel and the information on the website of the Institute for Creation Research at http : //www.icr.org As I 've gotten older I 've come to believe in God on an intellectual level as well as in my heart .",0

"What are the differences between Communism and Socialism ? I want to know the basic differences . And please , do n't make this up . The quick 'n ' easy way to remember the difference between Socialism and Communism is : Socialism is `` from each according to their ability , to each according to their DEEDS , '' whereas Communism is `` from each according to their ability to each according to their NEEDS . '' Socialism is the stage between Capitalism and Communism . It builds upon the previous system ( Capitalism ) by nationalizing the `` means of production '' ( i.e . corporations , resources , banks , etc . ) , but not by making everyone equal . In other words , people will be paid wages based on several factors ( social need , difficulty , amount of schooling required , etc . ) , so not everyone will make the same wage -- as is often a misinterpretation of Socialism . Communism is the point where the state `` withers away . '' In other words , it 's quite a few years in the future . If I had to guess , I 'd say at least 10 generations of established Socialism has to occur before people evolve enough to realize that hurting others or the system ends up hurting themselves . As Communists we advocate Socialism because it is the next necessary step to get to Communism . In other words , it 's not that we 've given up on building a house , we just realize there is a need for a sturdy foundation first . Communists believe in human evolution . We evolve in accordance to the system we live within . Capitalism has allowed us to evolve out of our feudalistic ways ( for the most part ) , and slavery does not exist in our country anymore ( for the most part ) . But Capitalism , which is driven by the need to always increase profits , founders a `` dog eat dog '' mentality . This is not a sustainable system , either for humankind or for the environment . Under Socialism people will evolve to the point where they care about each other regardless of their location or race or whatever . If we are to survive as a species , we need to evolve . That 's one of the many reasons I 'm a Communist . Finally , one misconception people often have about Communism is that we are looking to make everyone poor . On the contrary , we want everyone to enjoy as much as possible the fruits of our vast wealth .",0

"Should my router and modem be the same model ( Linksys ) to function at top capability ? I have an SBC modem and ( wired ) Linksys router . I have tried to connect my laptop to my network , but the router does not seem to configure while using the modem . When I plug the laptop into the SBC modem directly , everything works well . Any help on this is appreciated . Thanks . Well , it depends on the router and how your IP address is assigned but it sounds like to me you are going to have to go into your routers configuration and either tell it to detect the DHCP settings and your IP address automatically or you will have to specify it manually . My experience in this matter ( I have set up four DSL and two cable installations ) is that it should be assigned automatically if the router is n't detecting those ( i.e . the process of detecting it fails ) then the router is probably defective , I had that happen to a Netgear router , it would n't detect either one , I exchanged it for another one and the new one worked perfectly . So if auto detection does n't work , it 's probably the router.For more instructions select your model from the link below and see the user manual .",0

"what is biodiesel ? Biodiesel is a fuel that is made from either waste oil ( collected from restaurants ) or pure vegetable oil . It is often mixed with `` regular '' diesel . You can buy it at some gas stations , although it is n't common . The ratio of biodiesel to regular diesel varies depending on the vehicle and the season ( less biodiesel in the winter , for example ) . The benefits of biodiesel include lessening our dependence on foreign oil , increasing our use of renewable resources , especially those that are produced in our own country , and cleaner fuel both in use and in production . The US government 's standards for regular diesel are not as stringent as they are in other countries , although that will change in the next year or so . Right now , there are few American automakers who produce diesel passenger vehicles . You 'll find diesel trucks , but I do n't think there are any American made cars . This may change as the quality of diesel improves and as biodiesel becomes more readily available.Biodiesel is fairly easy to make . There are a lot of `` home brewers '' out there who collect waste oil from restaurants , filter it as necessary , and process it into biodiesel . My boss makes it in our shop and we use it in our company vehicles . Except for the occasional nasty smelling batch of cooking oil , it 's great . We 're greatly reducing our company 's fuel costs because the diesel vehicles have much better gas mileage , and we 're producing the biodiesel for less than $ 1.25 per gallon .",0

"I know somebody that does not want to go back to college . He begins to cry and he says he hates it. ? How can I help him ? For some , college can be their first push into independence . It can be terribly hard for those that have not had much experience in the world . Also , for those that have not socialized much before , college can be very intimidating . All of a sudden they are put into an environment where social contact is a constant.I can speak from experience- when first arriving at college I hated it . Roomates , no privacy , it was awful for me . However , when I gave it a little time those roomates that I loathed became great friends . Now the situation that I looked upon with so much disdain is now one of the most treasured periods of my life.My suggestion is to visit him at college . With having someone familiar there it will make him more comfortable . Perhaps help him break the ice with some other students . Also , let him know that he 's not the only one feeling that way . However , he needs to start owning his experience . Let him know that college is a great time to be able to learn and experience everything HE wants . There 's no one there to tell him what not to do . That be scary at first , but when he finally feels what it 's like to be independent , he 'll come around.Best of luck !",0

"Are pheromones found in human beings ? Humans have one or more pheromones ( originally called `` exaltolides '' ) , presumed to exist for some years , but formally accepted to exist in 1986 . They are strongest in women during the time period around ovulation and work subliminally ( at concentrations too small to recognize as an odor ) . They are responsible for women who live together , as in a dorm , synchronizing their ovulatory cycles . Men emit some at a regular rate , but the importance of this is not understood . At stronger concentrations these pheromones have a musky , even offensive , smell - thus the prevalence of musk-type perfumes trying to mimic the effect . It is the buildup of exaltolides in the air that may cause the heightened social activities in everybody at a crowded cocktail party or a dance . The increased body temperature from physical activity will increase evaporation into the air .",0

"who killed fernand magellan ? Death of MagellanHeading northwest , the crew reached the equator on 13 February 1521 . On 6 March , they reached the Marianas and on 16 March , the island of Homonhon in the Philippines , with 150 crewmen left . Magellan was able to communicate with the native peoples because his Malay interpreter could understand their language . They traded gifts with Rajah Kolambu of Limasawa , who guided them to Cebu , on April 7 . Rajah Humabon of Cebu was friendly to them , and even agreed to accept Christianity.The initial peace with the Philippine natives proved misleading . Magellan was killed in the Battle of Mactan , against indigenous forces led by Lapu-Lapu , on April 27 , 1521 . Antonio Pigafetta , a wealthy tourist who paid to be on the Magellan voyage , provided the only extant eyewitness account of the events culminating in Magellan 's death , as follows : Monument in Lapu-Lapu City that marks the site where Magellan was purportedly killed '' When morning came , forty-nine of us leaped into the water up to our thighs , and walked through water for more than two cross-bow flights before we could reach the shore . The boats could not approach nearer because of certain rocks in the water . The other eleven men remained behind to guard the boats . When we reached land , [ the natives ] had formed in three divisions to the number of more than one thousand five hundred persons . When they saw us , they charged down upon us with exceeding loud cries ... The musketeers and crossbow-men shot from a distance for about a half-hour , but uselessly ... Recognizing the captain , so many turned upon him that they knocked his helmet off his head twice ... An Indian hurled a bamboo spear into the captain 's face , but the latter immediately killed him with his lance , which he left in the Indian 's body . Then , trying to lay hand on sword , he could draw it out but halfway , because he had been wounded in the arm with a bamboo spear . When the natives saw that , they all hurled themselves upon him . One of them wounded him on the left leg with a large cutlass , which resembles a scimitar , only being larger . That caused the captain to fall face downward , when immediately they rushed upon him with iron and bamboo spears and with their cutlasses , until they killed our mirror , our light , our comfort , and our true guide . When they wounded him , he turned back many times to see whether we were all in the boats . Thereupon , beholding him dead , we , wounded , retreated , as best we could , to the boats , which were already pulling off .

I wish some crazed lunatic would drive by their picket line and mow them all down while simultaneously blowing their church to the top of Mt . Ararat.And since I 'm sure there will be a barrage of people saying the picketers are on the fringe , I have to say unfortunately they are not . They are all over the place . In our White House and now running the Supreme Court.I dare any one of you to actually read , word for word , the first four books of the Bible and tell me if you find it to be anything short of totally delusional.There are no such things as talking animals or invisible dead people with wings . Fred Phelps and the members of the Westboro Baptist Church *are* a fringe element . Most Christians would *not* picket the funeral of a deceased homosexual , or a deceased soldier who died in Iraq ( yep , Fred Phelps does that too ) . He is a crazy man who just happens to have a few followers , and they are very vocal . However , many bad things in the world have been perpetrated in the name of Christianity , such as the Crusades , slavery , witch hunts , the persecution of homosexuals , lesbians , bisexuals , and transgendered person today . This does not make all Christians `` mean '' or `` bad '' , just like all Russians are not tyrants because of Stalin and all Muslims are not out to destroy America because Al Queda makes attacks in the name of Islam and Allah . Individuals do bad things , groups are not to be defined by those individuals , even if there are a lot of them.Furthermore , the first 4 books of the Bible ( Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , and Numbers ) are not , strictly speaking , Christian compositions . They are the first 4 books of the Jewish Torah , and the Christians `` inherited '' them . This is *not* an attempt to say that `` it 's not Christians who are crazy , it 's the Jews ! `` , but rather a clarification as to the origin of those texts . They certainly *are* Christian texts in that they are used extensively by Christians and form a great deal of basic Christian belief ( the Creation , the Flood , the Abrahamic Promise , etc. ) . The Muslims *also* use these texts as a foundation for Islam , because they also consider themselves to be children of the Abrahamic Promise , descended from Abraham 's elder son , Ishmael . Thus , these books are given credence by three of the world 's major religions , making their `` delusional '' quality somewhat moot because of the sheer number of people who accept those `` delusions '' as true.There are a great many Christians who do try to conduct themselves well , based on their intreptation of what that means . Now , I do n't like their stance on abortion , but it comes from a genuine interest in the rights of the unborn , as people , as opposed to a genuine desire to degrade women to the simple status of breeding stock . Many Christians give charitable donations , such as for the tsunami or Hurricane Katrina , or other disasters . Many Christians go out of their way to be kind to other people . And many of these `` kind '' Christians do n't go about blowing their `` Look at me , I 'm a Christian '' whistle , the way the `` mean '' ones seem to do so often . So , the answer would be that individual Christians are mean for the same reason that individual atheists , individual Muslims , individual police officers , individual cat-kicking children , or individual pizza delivery guys are mean . They just are , and it 's not a reflection on the group at large .",0

With over 250 million copies of her novels in print , she has come a long way since she wrote her first novel in a spiral notebook using a No . 2 pencil . Now she has published over 150 novels and her work has been optioned and made into films , excerpted in national magazines and translated in over twenty-five different countries . `` I always have stories running around in my head , '' she explains . `` Once I start putting them down on paper , I just keep going ; I just keep writing . '' In addition to her amazing success in mainstream fiction , Nora Roberts remains committed to writing for her category romance audience that took her to into their heart in 1981 with her very first book , a Silhouette romance . Nora Roberts continues to write futuristic romantic suspense as J.D . Robb , and her characters Eve Dallas and Roarke have become two of her most popular creations ever . Her J.D . Robb titles are hailed as `` a perfect balance of suspense , futuristic police procedure and steamy romance ... truly fine entertainment '' by Publishers Weekly . Reviewers agree that Nora Roberts deserves praise . The Los Angeles Daily News describes her as `` a word artist , painting her story and her characters with vitality and verve .

Today , according to Entertainment Weekly , `` her stories have fueled the dreams of twenty-five million readers . '' One of America 's leading novelists , her books are published around the world . She is frequently invited to promote her novels in other countries . Her recent travels took her to England , Italy , Australia and Japan to meet fans , fellow authors and aspiring writers .

"What is a great natural small venue for an elopement - just bride , groom , minister and witnesses ? Want to get married in Seattle on August 27 while we are vacationing there .

I 've looked at several venues , but they are all for actual weddings with guests , caterers , etc . All I want is photographer to take some pics , a great bouquet and place to go after for dinner/dancing/partying . Any suggestions ? We are outdoorsy , artsy , not formal , dress and rings are vintage , prefer natural/historical/unusual setting to make it memorable and seems like we should n't have to pay to rent a venue as we have no guests . Suggestions/comments welcome ! What about a bed and breakfast ? If you are staying there while vacationing than I would see no reason for them to say no . It would probably be good for business too , if you gave them a picture to use in a brochure .

"Has anyone lived in India ? What was your experience ? I want to visit but India is so vast and has so many appealing areas , that I would n't know where to begin ? Any advice ? it depends on what you want to do and see . I would n't say that I lived there , but I was there for 5 months . The longest period of time i was in one place was 2 months . Honestly i do n't even know where to begin describing what it was like . it was without a doubt a very positive , but sometimes stressful , experience . I think that everybody should travel to india at least once . I traveled only in the north , so that is the only area i can really give advice on . For the south i heard that Kerala , Hampi , and Pondicherry were the places to see , but I could n't tell you if that is true . To start with let me say that traveling in india is not as daunting as it seems . i started out with a program , but stayed on after its end when i realized that i would be able to get around on my own . unless you have about a year , you will probably not see everything , so do n't worry about seeing everything . You can probably get by just fine with only english , but it never hurts to know a little hindi or whatever the local language is , if only to see the shock on people 's faces . lol . The cost is very cheap , you can easily get by on $ 10 a day ( room , board , insurance , food , and maybe transportation ) . Sanitation is a big problem over there ( to us ! ) , but if you just use common sense you will be fine . it is a very safe country for the most part , but if you are a lone female you do need to exercise some caution . nearly every female traveller i came across had at least one complaint of minor harassment.the places that i saw that i really liked and/or you have to see are in the north : ladakh , dharamsala , manali , kashmir are all in the mountains and are much more relaxed than the cities in the central plains , although kashmir is not so safe in rajasthan : jodhpur without a doubt , jaipur is more popular with tourists but i did n't like it as muchin central india : agra of course , orchha ( near jhansi ) , varanasi ( stressful , but worth it for the sights and culture shock ) , khajuraho ( although they really go after tourists here ) , and delhi of course ( but it can be a bit stressful if you stay there too long ) in the east : darjeeling is a good place to chill , and i heard sikkim is amazingthe best advice i have , if you have n't already done it , is to get a guidebook ( i used lonely planet ) now and start looking at pics and reading about the places . i really hope that you get as much out of it as i did.if you do have any other specific questions , you can email me if you want : jeff32224 @ yahoo.comgood luck !",0

"Is it real that human evolved from Monkey ? Some or ours do , I think. ? According to the theory of evolution , which is strongly supported scientifically , we are not decended from apes , monkeys or chimpanzees . We do , however , share a common ancestor with them . Humans evolved from that common ancestor to become what we are today , and the others evolved to become what they are today . However , there are other viewpoints on this matter , which , though not scientifically supported , are in wide belief in many cultures . These ideas are based on religious belief systems . These belief systems contend that humans have NOT evolved , and were created just as we are today by a diety or dieties . Whether this is true or not , is a source of much debate .",0

This means that something or someone is beautiful , depending on the person who is looking .

"Does my mom hate me ? Their are four kids in our family . My mom treats me and my oldest sister like we are slaves . My other sister and brother , she praises for cleaning up their own messes . I clean the house she says I missed a spot , looks at me like I 'm stupid and does it herself . When my midle sisters grades come in , my mom tells her what a good job she has done , keeping her grades up .

Their are other things that she will let my middle sister do that she would n't let my older sister or me do . no , i am sure that she doesnt hate you.i get the sense , however , that she is expecting soething from you with isnt fair for her to ask : she wants you to take a back seat to your siblings . i miagine that would be a very hard thing for anyone to do ... i wish that i could give you some sort of magical advice that would fix your problem in one fell swoop , but we both know there is no such answer . the best that i can tell you is that you and your older sister both need to talk to your mother about they way that you feel.explain it to her . allow her to ask questions , and maybe vent a little if she needs to . dont approach her with a accusatory manner , and dont give her the feeling she is being ganged up on . simply tell her the way that this treatment make the two of you feel , and i bet she will understand . however , just cuz she understands , does not mean that she will then fix the problem in one fell swoop.if the above doesnt work the only other advice i could give the two of you is to suck it up , and deal with it , and thank the Lord for what you do have , and for the good in your lives rather than the bad . sometimes people are so set in their ways that they cant even comprehend change , and i pray that mother isnt one of them.anyway , i wish you both the best of luck , and i hope that this helped you , even if only a little . : - )",0

"I got my first speeding ticket after years of driving . I live in Layton Utah , What options do I have ? I was speeding in an industrial area . Clocked for 9 over the limit . I am trying to discover my options on how to settle this without points on my license . I 'm not disputing guilt , but I have a clean driving record which spans 35 years . Check with the city of Layton to see if they offer a traffic class . In lieu of going to court , most cities will off you a Plea In Abeyance . It 's essentially entering a guilty plea , paying a reduced fine , and agreeing to go to traffic class . You will have to pay for the traffic class seperately from the ticket amount . If you take the class then the points do n't appear on your license . If you do n't take the class , then you have to pay the full amount of the ticket and the points will be put on your license . It 's annoying to get a ticket but the class is n't too painful and it helps to brush up on your driving knowledge . Good luck and happy driving !",0
"Why did the German government introduce Submarine warfare ? NO SPAM PLZ ! I presume you mean `` unrestricted '' submarine warfare.The short answer was to win the war . A better answer was because the English blockade of of Germany had the effect of starving the German populace of both food and resources.During WW1 , the British Navy was the most powerful force in the world . The German surface Navy could not hope to be an effective counter to it , so Germany had to resort to tactics other than traditional surface conflict . Submarines or Unterseebooten ( U-Boats ) were one means employed by the Germans . U-Boats were the `` Stealth Bombers '' of thier day . They could sneak up on surface ships undetected , and sink them with torpedoes.Germany 's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was originally instituted to combat the overwhelming superiority of the English Navy , but when they started sinking un-armed vessels with other nations peoples on board ( specifically Americans ) this helped draw America into the war . When the American 's arrived , it tipped the balance in favor of the allies ultimately losing the war for Germany .",0

They will give you a good pair of shoes and you may want to specifiy that you want really good shock absorbant shoes . After you go to the specialty store you can buy them there ( or look for the same shoes cheaper online ) .

First start with builing up distance ... walk 1-3 miles . Once you are comfortable with that- work on your speed . Slowly your walk will be a fast walk , and then eventually a jog . Build up your speed and distance over several weeks . Remember do n't do it too fast . Any excerise is more than none ( and better than hurting yourself . )",0

Cyanuric acid ( also called pyrolithic acid ) , white monoclinic crystal with the structure of [ HOC ( NCOH ) 2N ] , is the compound of polymerized cyanic acid . Cyanic acid hydrolyses to ammonia and carbon dioxide in water . Its salts and esters are cyanates ( or called fulminates ) . Esters of normal cyanic acid are not known . There is another isomeric cyanic acid with the structure of H-N=C=O , which is called isocyanic acid . Its salts and esters are isocyanates . Cyanates ( or Isocyanates ) are used in the manufacturing pharmaceuticals , pesticides , textile softener , lubricants and industrial disinfectants through the conversion to polycyclic compounds ( such as hydantoins and imidazolons ) They are used as plastic additives and as heat treatment salt formulations for metals . Thiocyanate is a salt or ester of thiocyanic acid ( HSCN ) . Aqueous solutions of thiocyanic acid , also called sulfocyanic acid , are very strong acids of the equilibrium mixture of thiocyanic and isothiocyanic . Thiocyanates are bonded through the sulfur ( s ) with the structure R-S-C¡ÕN or the isomeric R-N=C=S ( isothiocyanates ) . Thiocyanates are bonded through the sulfur ( s ) which replace for the oxygen ( O ) atom . Thiocyanates are the sulfur analog of isocyanates . Organic as well as metallic thiocyanates [ CuSCN , Ca ( SCN ) 2 , NaSCN , KSCN ] are very versatile compounds .

"does lifting weights during basketball season affect your shot at all ? my shot has been off recently and one of my friends thought it might be form lifting weights so i thought id check it out .

If you were born on US soil ( definitions of this can be complex , but it certainly includes all US States , Puerto Rico , etc ) , you acquired US citizenship at the time of birth under jus solis . you can check the source below for more information . If you are abroad , you can contact the local Embassy of Consulate of the nation you are interested in for information . Otherwise , you would normally refer to the local office of your country 's agency for handling citizenship , usually the Ministry of Internal Affairs , Home Ministry or Foreign Ministry.If you were born to at least one parent who was a US citizen at the time of your birth , you may be a US citzen under jus sangre . To determine this , check the source I list below . Your parent will have had to meet certain residency requirements and determination can only be made by factors such as your birthdate , which of parents is a citizen , and how long they may have resided in the US.Disclaimer : taking advice from a person using Bubba as a screen name could be hazardous for your health .

In general , the dialect of whoever 's in power is considered the standard , because people want to be like that powerful group . Americans who are trying to speak Standard American English do so because they think it will give them social power . What 's interesting , though , is that Standard American English is just agreed upon as the standard by many Americans even though it does n't belong to a particular region.The Founding Fathers spoke a dialect that is different from either American dialects or British dialects today .

what is the best computer to buy for the home ? Not a Dell . Anything but a Dell . Really all depends on what you are going to use it for . If you just use it to type and go on there interent then you reall dont need an expensive one . But if you are going to play games or download a lot of stuff then you will need to get more mem and hard drive space . I woud say for the person that does a lot on the computer you would need 512 of Mem and about 60 GB of hard drive . I would go with a Pentium M ( Centrino if laptop ) . But if your not going to do that much on it I would go below those specs and save you some money . If you want to get a good deal on some good PC go to this web site . www.ubid.com . I got my laptop there for 800 and it is worth more then 1200 . So good luck on finding a PC,0

"why was Thomas More beheaded ? More refused to attend the coronation of Anne Boleyn as the Queen of England . Shortly thereafter More was charged with accepting bribes , but the patently false charges had to be dismissed for lack of any evidence . In 1534 he was accused of conspiring with Elizabeth Barton , a nun who had prophesized against the king 's divorce , but More was able to produce a letter in which he had instructed Barton not to interfere with state matters.On April 13 of that year More was asked to appear before a commission and swear his allegiance to the parliamentary Act of Succession . More accepted Parliament 's right to declare Anne the legitimate queen of England , but he refused to take the oath because an anti-papal preface to the Act made of it an acknowledgement of Parliament 's authority to legislate in matters of religion by denying the authority of the Pope , which More would not accept . Four days later he was imprisoned in the Tower of London , where he wrote his devotional Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation.On July 1 , 1535 , More was tried before a panel of judges that included the new Lord Chancellor , Sir Thomas Audley , as well as Anne Boleyn 's father , brother , and uncle . He was charged with high treason for denying the validity of the Act of Succession . More believed he could not be convicted as long as he did not explicitly deny that the king was the head of the church , and he therefore refused to answer all questions regarding his opinions on the subject . Thomas Cromwell , at the time the most powerful of the king 's advisors , brought forth the Solicitor General , Richard Rich , to testify that More had , in his presence , denied that the king was the legitimate head of the church . This testimony was almost certainly perjured ( witnesses Richard Southwell and Mr Palmer both denied having heard the details of the reported conversation ) , but on the strength of it the jury voted for More 's conviction",0

The boards were traditionally made out of a thick block of wood , with a hollow pyramid carved into the underside for strength and to make it sound better when the pieces ( black and white stones ) are placed.It is also cool to find out that the black stones ( kinda shaped like M & M candies ) are bigger than the white ones .

"does outter space ever end ? ? The best guess today : no.In modern cosmology the topology of the universe appears to be open . `` Topology '' meaning the shape , although in the case of the universe to observe the shape we would have to exist in 4 spatial dimensions . Since we 're stuck in 3-dimensions we have to get by on analogies.The topology or shape of the universe is something which comes out of Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity . It depends primarily on the distribution of mass and energy in the universe . If the amount of mass-energy is more than a certain critical value then the universe would be `` closed . '' Basically the mass would curve space-time back onto itself . In a closed universe you could fly off in the direction of the north pole and ( after about 25 billion years ) and circle the universe to land on the south pole.If the amount of mass in the universe is less than this critical value then the topology of the universe is a bit more complex , but , to answer your question space would be infinite.Based on what we know today that is the case , space is infinite.However , we can not see an infinite universe . When we see things that are farther away we also see them from deeped in the past . A galaxy we see that is 10 billion light years distant is actually a view of what the galaxy looked like 10 billion years in the past.When we look farther in space , and thus earlier in the history of the universe , we eventually run into the microwave background . For the first 10,000 years or so after the Big Bang the universe was so dense that it was n't yet transparent . When the density dropped enough to be transparent then some of the light could escape for us to detect much later.However , while the universe is thought to be about 13 billion years old , we can actually see out a bit farther than that , I think around 20 billion light years , because the universe is expanding.What this boils down to is that there is a sort of `` wall '' beyond which we ca n't see . This wall corresponds to a time soon after the Big Bang . However , studies of the total mass-energy within the universe strongly suggest that it has an open topology - that it is infinite . ( Of course it is possible that this infinity will be refined when we have a better theory of how Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity play togther . String Theory is one way to combine these two . )",0

"what causes hiccups ? Hiccups are gulping sounds caused by involuntary spasms of the diaphragm . The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen and helps with breathing . Hiccups can be triggered if you eat too much or too fast , consume very hot or cold foods and beverages , or drink carbonated beverages . Other causes include cold showers , entering or leaving a hot or cold room , sudden excitement , and stress . Hiccups are not a serious medical condition and usually disappear on their own within a few minutes . If they last longer than 24 hours , hiccups may be a sign of another condition or injury . You should see your health care provider if you experience prolonged hiccuping . Home remedies are usually the primary treatment for hiccups , although no one is really sure how well they work . Hiccup home remedies include sneezing , being suddenly frightened , holding your breath , gargling , drinking pineapple juice , drinking water rapidly , sipping ice water , or swallowing dry granulated sugar . These activities may help by altering breathing patterns .",0

"what is ... ? What is Scienctology ( sp.. sorry ) I just recently heard that term used for a type of religion , I was courious to know if anyone new what it was or what it is about ... thanks Hi , here are a few detailsScientology is a system of beliefs , teachings and rituals , originally established as a secular philosophy in 1952 by science-fiction author L. Ron Hubbard , then recharacterized by him in 1953 as an `` applied religious philosophy . `` Scientology is officially represented by the controversial Church of Scientology . The Church presents itself as a non-profit religious organization dedicated to encouraging development of the human spirit . Providing counseling and rehabilitation programs , the Church offers itself as an alternative to psychiatry , which Scientologists believe to be a barbaric and corrupt profession . [ 1 ] ( http : //www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/heritage/pg011.html ) Church spokespeople attest that Hubbard 's teaching ( called `` technology '' or `` tech '' ) has freed them from drug and alcohol addictions , depression , learning disabilities , mental disorders and other problems.Scientology , however , has been the object of many allegations that sharply contradict the Church 's self-description . Critics—including officials and the courts of several countries—have characterized the Church of Scientology as an unscrupulous commercial organization ; it has often been described not as a religion , but a man-made cult that harasses its critics and exploits its members . Many of the Church 's most controversial actions are , critics argue , a direct reflection of Hubbard 's Scientology teachings.Origins of ScientologyScientology was expanded and reworked from Dianetics [ 2 ] ( http : //www.neuereligion.de/ENG/Wolf/pg6.htm ) , an earlier system of self-improvement techniques originally set out by Hubbard in the 1950 book , Dianetics : The Modern Science of Mental Health . Immediately prior to this work , Hubbard was intensively involved with the occultist Jack Parsons in performing the occult rites developed by Aleister Crowley . Some critics have seen many similarities in Hubbard 's writings to the doctrines of Crowley [ 3 ] ( http : //www.xenu.net/archive/lrhbare/lrhbare08.html ) .By the mid-1950s , Hubbard had relegated Dianetics to being a sub-study of Scientology , although it is still promoted and delivered by Scientology organizations . The chief difference between the two is that Dianetics is explicitly secular , focused on the individual 's present life and dealing with physical and mental or emotional problems , whereas Scientology adopts a more overtly religious approach [ 4 ] ( http : //victorian.fortunecity.com/finsbury/124/last.htm ) focused on dealing with spiritual issues spanning multiple past lives as well as the present day.Hubbard was repeatedly accused of adopting a religious facade for Scientology in order for the organization to maintain tax-exempt status and avoid prosecution for false medical claims ; these accusations have dogged the Church of Scientology to the present day , bolstered by numerous accounts from Hubbard 's fellow science-fiction authors that on various occasions he stated that the way to get rich was to start a religion [ 5 ] ( http : //www.bible.ca/scientology-1million-start-a-religion.htm ) .The word scientology has a history of its own . Although nowadays associated almost exclusively with Hubbard 's work , it was coined by the philologist Alan Upward in 1907 as a synonym for `` pseudoscience '' . [ 6 ] ( http : //www.instinct.org/texts/bluesky/bs3-4.htm ) In 1934 , the Argentine-German writer Anastasius Nordenholz published a book using the word positively : Scientologie , Wissenschaft von der Beschaffenheit und der Tauglichkeit des Wissens , or Scientology , Science of the Constitution and Usefulness of Knowledge . [ 7 ] ( http : //www.scientologie.de/scientologie/index.htm ) Nordenholz 's book is a study of consciousness , and its usage of the word is not greatly different from Hubbard 's definition , `` knowing how to know '' . However , it is not clear to what extent Hubbard was aware of these earlier usages . The word itself is",0

"What is the problem for scientists in explaining `` phantom limb '' ? The problem is that the brain is receiving signals , usually pain , that it thinks are coming from nerves that have been removed , by amputation , injury , or whatever reason . ( Phantom pain also occurs in the form of phantom tooth aches in people who have had all of their teeth removed . ) The question is where do the signals that the brain is receiving come from . There are several steps involved in getting a signal from the source , the sensory nerve ending , to the brain . The system of communication is so complex in the nervous system , it is hard to track exactly how the signal progresses through the body . Where the signal starts is unclear , because it can not start at the nerve ending .",0

"Should NiCADS get hot when they are in use ? ( NOT WHEN CHARGING ) ? When using a Modified 6V nicad ( use to be 4.8V ) it becomes very hot..probly about +70C . the system it drives is designed to automatically shut down when supply voltage drops ( Unsure what to ) reciently tested and found the drop from the 6V was as followsFully Charged = 7.55VShut down voltage = 5.89VHowever i have not modified the system in which it is used for so how is it that it is shutting down before the standard nicad voltage of 4.8V ? Have placed the Nicad in the freezer to see if dropping the temperature will allow me to re use the nicad in the system . Please help electronics ar n't my thing NiCads in general electronic applications are typically designed to NOT get hot , since the heat destroys the NiCad battery , can damage electronics and causes lawsuits when users get burned from the hot battery . Some devices like radio-controlled cars are high-drain applications that generate a lot of heat , so the batteries for these devices are designed for their specific use.Batteries get hot when they charge due to the high current going into them . The faster they charge , typically the hotter they get . When the battery discharges during use , the same thing happens , the battery gets hotter as more current is drawn from the battery . Without knowing anything else , my guess is that high current draw from the battery cells is causing them to heat up . This can be due to a defective battery , a battery not designed for the way you are using it or your modification damaged the battery or is otherwise causing excessive current drain.Also , increasing the supply voltage can drive more current through the device , so it may just be that the higher voltage is drawing more current.I ’ m not sure how the device is shutting down , so I can ’ t say why it ’ s doing that . Note that the voltage at which a device stops working is the voltage seen by the device itself . If you remove the battery from the device and measure the voltage , you will get a different voltage than if you measure the voltage at the precise moment the device shuts down . This is especially true for high current drain applications , which appears to be what ’ s happening with your batteries . Placing the NiCad ’ s in the freezer wo n't help . They ’ ll have to warm up to work properly anyway .",0

On two separate study days , corresponding to different phases of their menstrual cycle , stimuli were presented while exposed to male axillary pheromones and under a control condition ( no pheromone ) . The order of testing was balanced with respect to pheromone/control condition and menstrual cycle phase . Pheromone exposure resulted in significantly higher attractiveness ratings of vignette characters and faces . Use of the contraceptive pill or menstrual cycle phase had equivocal effects on some vignette items and neither had any influence on female ratings of male facial attractiveness . The results of this study suggest that exposure to natural male axillary pheromones can significantly enhance female perceptions of various aspects of male attractiveness. -- -- -There 's no question that overt and extreme body odor is repellent to many ( and certainly it can be ! ) -- especially since we 've been trained by countless advertisements to find it so . However , it 's an evolutionary adaptation of some kind , which ( certainly in the pre-bath eras ) must have operated as a signal of some kind to females : of health , of strength , of non-sickness perhaps .",0

"over 200 years ago what did Carolus Linnaeus classify living things on ? Taxonomy . In his major work Systema Naturae ( The System of Nature ) , first published in 1735 , Linnaeus devised a system of classification of organisms that is still in use today . This system places living things within increasingly specific categories based on common attributes—from a general grouping ( kingdom ) down to the specific individual ( species ) . Using this system , Linnaeus named nearly 10,000 plant and animal species in his lifetime . Not an evolutionist by any means , Linnaeus believed that each species was created by God and was incapable of change . Nevertheless , his orderly groupings of living things provided important insights for later theorists .",0

Bras do n't preserve the shape or perkiness of breasts .

"My bad habit : chewing my fingers . What is the best way to stop it and break the habit ? I 've been chewing my fingers ever since I was in elementary . Nowadays , even at 20 - I occasionally chew on them when I get a little nervous or jittery , but I do n't even realize that . It 's getting a bit annoying and embarassing ... how do I stop it ? HMMMM some very interesting answers here that I like ... .Such as the rubber band idea . I would recomend that idea and see if that helps . If not ... .First of all as a former thumb sucker and smoker I understand oral fixations ( I quit the thumb thing a 12 started smoking at 13 and just quit that at 22 , about two months ago ) . Even now you will usually catch me with a touthpick , rubber band , bottle lid , pencils , or other item in my mouth . I have seriously cut back the habbit and consiously have to make efforts not to do it . Here are some suggestions . First of all peppers contain volitale oils that can chemically burn skin so avoid those . Purchase some alum powder and mix the powder with a few drops of water ( Enough to make a slightly runny paste . ) and soak your fingers in it . Alum is very , unpleasantly bitter and will immediately make your mouth pucker . Some people like lemon juice or tobasco so using those items usually does n't work because the taste is n't very strong . Next put up sticky notes at the places you are most like to do this . Repeating to yourself that this is bad trains your mind to avoid doing it subconsciously . If you are like me you also put your hand on your face ( or chin in hand , whatever ) . You can curb this action as well by improving your posture . Freeze yourself the next time you catch yourself doing this ( or finger chewing ) and analyze how you are sitting . Usually slumped with your elbow on the table or with your elbow semi supported by your stomach or chest . If you start improving your posture then you will become less inclined to hold your arm up unsupported for very long . I am using an exercise ball for a computer chair right now to retrain my posture . My doctor recomended it and I highly agree , I 've already noticed a difference.Cheer up though . Some studies say that finger chewing , nail biting , and other oral fixations are all signs of higher intelligence . It is believed that the brain in these cases works so fast that it actually gets bored or is somehow unstimulated . By controlling physical movement while mental processes such as reading or talking occur your brain is exercising itself and making you smarter and faster by training itself to multitask.Oh and a side note . Many people often notice that they chew nails/fingers in response to nervousness . The sucking/chewing motion is deeply ingrained in our most primitive side as being calming . When we are babies and we recieve food ( suckle ) subconciously we are aware of being protected by our mothers . The sucking/chewing motion along with full belly releases seratonin in the child inducing pleasure and happiness . In response to certain stresses adults will ocassionally do the same thing for the chemical calm it can induce , without even thinking about it . I tend to do this in the store especially when I ca n't find something . I feel lost and confused and tend to stick the tip of one or more finger in my mouth while looking .",0

"The weather just said we will have snow showers , but the current temp is 36 . Can snow form above freezing ? Your temprature of 36 degrees is simply a ground level temprature . It is not the air temprature of the weather system that you are currently within . Because of that , the air temprature above you , where the snoe will form is quite a bit colder . Once snow starts to form within the weather system , the ground temprature will begin to drop from 36 Degrees to around 30-28 degrees for a short period of time . From 22-28 degrees snow falls best . THe sudden drop in temprature is n't that hard to predict , so chances are your weather station was indeed correct .",0

"How do I know if my childs imagination is too extensive ? She is 3yrs old and has several imaginary friends , insists we feed her dolls our food at meals , and she is constantly making up stories about when she was older or a baby . I 'm beginning to think she 's losing touch with reality . While having an active imagination is no crime and certainly should n't alarm you as a parent , you might consider what these friends provide for your daughter . It seems like she has experienced some instability in life right now and if she is feeling detached from her father , then she may be concerned that you , her mother might also unexpectedly leave or disappear . She is only 3 and is limited on her ability to communicate and understand these abandoning feelings and may have created an abundance of imaginary friends because she knows she can count on them not leaving . She may not be able to say , `` Mommy , are you going to leave too ? '' But she can create a fantasy of dolls and imaginary friends that support and validate her feelings . So while I would n't say that you should seek clinical therapy for your 3 year old , I would suggest that a sincere heart to heart with your daughter , and some invested mommy time , you could really help your daughter reconnect to the real supports in her life , you ! Suggestion : Find a way to validate her feelings . Having a drawing party ! Allow her to draw , and invite her imaginary friends to draw also . Sit at a table that is age appropriate for her ( or sit on the floor ) and allow her to describe to you the drawings of all the friends , as well as her own drawing . You might suggest to her drawing a few pictures . Maybe one of `` our new house '' . Have another drawing of `` our family '' , and her school/friends , room or house . You will learn a lot from her and it will allow her practice in expressing her feelings to you , her mom , rather than dolls and friends . Find age appropriate ways of bonding with your daughter . I would love to hear what you try and how it turns out ! Good Luck ! emailjacquisoon @ yahoo.com",0

"dealing with conceptual physics..where can i find help with my homework ? the question is ... the weight of the atmosphere above 1 square meter of the earths surface is 100,000 newtons . If the density of the atmosphere were a constant 1.2 kg/m3 , calculate where the top of the atmosphere would be . hecka hard ! ! ! any suggestions ? hecka ! ! damn . i miss california.what you have to do is realize that this question is asking about the volume of a rectangular shape that is 1 meter by 1 meter by X meters , where X is the height of the column.so , you know the density.. density is defined as mass divided by volume . and you know the weight.. which is mass times acceleration . here the acceleration is the acceleration of gravity `` g '' = 9.8 m/s^2 . so you can do a little algebra to get the equation volume = mass / density volume = weight / ( acceleration * density ) you know the weight ( 100,000 N ) , the acceleration ( 9.8 m/s^2 ) and the density ( 1.2 kg/m^3 ) . plug those numbers in and you get the VOLUME of the atmosphere , and since you know 2 of the dimensions of the box ( it is 1 square meter across the bottom face , remember ) you can figure out the 3rd pretty easily.since this is your homework i wont just tell you the answer , but you should be pretty much able to crank it out from here .",0

"What is special about the number 1729 ? A Zeisel number is a square-free integer k with at least three prime factors which fall into the patternpx = apx − 1 + b where a and b are some integer constants and x is the index number of each prime factor in the factorization , sorted from lowest to highest . For the purpose of determining Zeisel numbers , p0 = 1 . The first few Zeisel numbers are105 , 1419 , 1729 , 1885 , 4505 , 5719 , 15387 , 24211 , 25085 , 27559 , 31929 , 54205 , 59081 , 114985 , 207177 , 208681 , 233569 , 287979 , 294409 , 336611 , 353977 , 448585 , 507579 , 982513 , 1012121 , 1073305 , 1242709 , 1485609 , 2089257 , 2263811 , 2953711 ( sequence A051015 in OEIS ) . To give an example , 1729 is a Zeisel number with the constants a = 1 and b = 6 , its factors being 7 , 13 and 19 , falling into the patternp1 = 7 , p1 = 1p0 + 6 p2 = 13 , p2 = 1p1 + 6 p3 = 19 , p3 = 1p2 + 6 1729 is an example for Carmichael numbers of the kind ( 6n+1 ) ( 12n+1 ) ( 18n+1 ) , which satisfied the pattern px = apx − 1 + b with a= 1 and b = 6n , so that every Carmichael number , you can construct with the formula ( 6n+1 ) ( 12n+1 ) ( 18n+1 ) , is a Zeisel number.Other Carmichael numbers of that kind are : 294409 , 56052361 , 118901521 , 172947529 , 216821881 , 228842209 , 1299963601 , 2301745249 , 9624742921 , ... The name Zeisel numbers was probably introduced by Kevin Brown , who was looking for numbers that when plugged into the equation2k − 1 + k yield prime numbers . In a posting to the newsgroup sci.math on 1994-02-24 , Helmut Zeisel pointed out that 1885 is one such number . Later it was discovered ( by Kevin Brown ? ) that 1885 additionally has prime factors with the relationship described above , so a name like Brown-Zeisel Numbers might be more appropriate .",0
"Is an IRA account protected against civil judgement from a lawsuit when the account owner lives in NYC or NJ ? I am not sure how the state laws of NY or NJ address the protection of IRA assets , but the new bankruptcy law enacted last year does provide ceratin protections on a national basis . the following excerpt is from `` http : //www.retirement-retirement.com/story-486.php '' [ Especially important to participants in employer-based retirement plans is that the bankruptcy act says that all assets rolled over from these plans into an IRA , and all subsequent earnings made inside the account attributable to the rollover , are protected from creditors , regardless of the amount of the rollover . That should remove much of the reluctance among investors to move most retirement plan assets into IRAs if they decide that 's the best financial strategy . While IRAs have unlimited protection for certain rollover amounts , such is not the case for original ( non-rollover ) contributions by the owner to traditional and Roth IRAs . The bankruptcy act put a price tag on the `` reasonably necessary '' amount that might be protected in these IRAs ­ $ 1 million . That is , if the aggregated value of your original contributions and their earnings to traditional and Roth IRAs exceeds $ 1 million , the amount above $ 1 million ( excluding any protected rollover amounts ) could be vulnerable to creditors . That $ 1 million amount is indexed annually to inflation . Most investors building an IRA from scratch wo n't exceed the $ 1 million limit , since annual contribution limits to traditional and Roth IRAs have been relatively low for the past two decades . And the bankruptcy act allows bankruptcy courts to permit the IRA owner to keep more than $ 1 million if it is in the `` interest of justice '' ( though the act did not spell out what constitutes an interest in justice ) . ]",0

"When and how will U.S. Congress and the White House succeed in destroying the Middle Class American ?

Therefore , the middle class income median that thrived throughout the 90s will ( or already has been ) reduced to a mere pittance above minimum wage—otherwise known as , I think , global wage.Still the question remains : “ How soon will the 1 % wealthy succeed in creating a two class society , that will eventually implode in on itself ? ” You know what I think ?

"why are women not as straight forward as men are ... ? Women are taught to answer in a non-threatening indirect way from the time they are very little girls . Little girls are told to `` Be nice . '' So they learn not to take the chance of hurting feelings or offending someone . Indirect communication is one of the best ways to do this . Also , women 's minds make connections more easily than men 's minds so what men may percieve as indirect may just mean that the woman is engaging in `` web '' thinking rather than the `` linear '' way in which most men think . To help you understand what she 's saying , it is a good idea to just ask questions . Make them non-threatening . A good example would be , `` Can you tell me more about that .

"how to correct red eye in photography ? If you want to eliminate red-eye before your photo even makes it into the computer : Red eye is caused when flash is fired directly into the eye , bounces off the red blood vessels at the back of the eye , and is reflected back into the lens.The solution would be to fire the flash at an angle , for example , downwards towards the subjects , rather than right at them . This would require an external flash unit that has a swivel head , and of course , for inexpensive point and shoots , this is not really an option , but I put it out there . Not only will you eliminate red eye but you will greatly improve the look of your photos is you learn how to use an external flash unit properly and bounce light off nearby walls.Or , in some cases , why not turn off the flash altogether and prop your camera against a surface or use a tripod , and get the subjects to stay still a little .

"How does air pressure effects the ability of a ball to bounce ? My guess is 2 things ... First of all , the lower the air pressure , the less resistance that the ball will encounter along its path . Secondly , if the ball is hollow ( e.g . a tennis ball or basket ball ) then the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the ball will reflect how easily it will bounce .",0

Math question-Is ln ( a+b ) = lna + lnb ? The trick to remembering the log rules is that they are the same as the exponent rules since logs are just rewritten exponents . ( x^2 ) ( x^3 ) = x^ ( 2+3 ) = x^5log [ ( a ) ( b ) ] = log a + log b ( x^4 ) / ( x^2 ) = x^ ( 4-2 ) = x^2log [ a/b ] = log a - log b ( x^3 ) ^2 = x^ [ ( 3 ) ( 2 ) ] = x^6log [ a^b ] = b [ log a ] The rules for log and ln are the same since the only difference is log has base 10 ( unless otherwise noted ) and ln has a base of e.There are also the two inverse functions with log and ln,0

"May I Know which Organ Produces Blood PLasma ? I need it for school homework before 2 Febuary plz ! ! ! ! ! ! ! No organ produces Blood Plasma , it is a product of several organs or one could say the body . It consists of ( mostly ) water , salts ( electrolytes ) , and proteins ( albumin and antibodies being the majority ) . All the water , salts , and proteins ultimately are derived from the GI tract ; i.e. , what you eat . The water and salts are regulated by the renal system . Albumin is produced by the liver ( and it is in the majority for plasma protein ) and antibodies are a product of the immune system . There is also a balance of proteins and water within the vasculature ( intravascular space ) and without ( extravascular space ) . So , there is always an influx/efflux balance between your tissues and the vasculature depending on the osmostic pressure ( mostly ) and mechanical pressure . This is all in one giant balance or homeostasis most of the time . Hence , why it 's a good idea to see plasma as a total body product.I just read the above answers . Plasma is NOT produced in the bone marrow . Blood cells are produced in the marrow . Plasma is what you have left over when you remove those cells .",0

"What are greenhouse conditions ? ? I 'm doing a biology research and I ca n't find anything on what greenhouse conditions are ! ! HELP ! !

Millions of people rely upon `` Greenhouses '' for the perpectuation of `` our '' food supply.Greenhouse conditions are warm and moist.Take boiling water in a pot for example.You heatwater to a certain degree then it begins to evaporate.You can see this by the steam or watervapor the rises out of the pot.Now with a `` greenhouse '' The water gets warm eventually very concentrated warm and starts to arise.All water evaporates.This is the changing of liquid to vapor.Vapor is a gaseous substance , a `` green house '' islike an vapor barrier.The sealed encloser traps thismoister within the walls .The moister then fallsback down , creatin a perpectual cycle of water , theliquid of life !",0

"what is the main cause why computer gets a virus ? As the other responders suggest , people do n't practice safe computing .

I assure you , this is a false sense of security . Do not trust the hardware or software to do the whole job for you.I believe the primary reason why computers get a virus is a lack of common sense . To wit ... - Be skeptical of anything you receive in e-mail that was not solicited , especially if it has an attachment.- Think twice before downloading that freeware.- Avoid Kazaa and the like.- Do review website certificates to satisfy yourself that the site you 're heading for is really the site you wanted to go to.- Make sure you download and install every security patch your OS vendor provides . You should manually review your vendor at least weekly ... even if you have an automatic update feature.A few minutes spent on satisfying yourself that you 've done everything you can do will provide you with peace of mind .",0

No one plan to Nuke the US specially Iranian , there are more Irani people in US than you can imagine , just go check your best universities like MIT or Stanford.The only attack to US has done by Bin Laden and if you know he was created by CIA in order to prevent Afghanestan to have a government like Iran and Iranian supported Anti Taliban groups in Afghanestan all the time that US was supporting them , and Iran government yelled that he is a murderer , its not Iranian fault.US do n't like Iran to be a nuclear power , its a fact but you must search the reason elsewhere , its not hollywood movies , its politics.A nuclear Iran will ruin all power equations in Middle East . Even they can force US to leave the territory . That 's the real reason.Iran has threatened Israel to wipe out of the map for 30 years and nothing actually has happened and will not happen.The main use of Nuke is n't military , its political , look at India and Pakistan , they declared they are both have nukes at the same time . they both have it but it was hidden , when one did a nuclear test the other one did it about a week .

"Has anyone heard of the `` sleep cure '' ? Supposedly it 's a means to lose a fair amount of weight over the course of a few days . You 're sedated and you wake up days later having lost 8-10 pounds . Real , or just some fictional fantasy that keeps cropping up in various books ? Sounds like some serious wishful thinking to me , combined with some misinterpreted observation.If you weigh yourself right before bed and then first thing in the morning , you will find that you 've lost a couple of pounds overnight . However , you 'll find by that evening that the weight is back.Makes it look like the best way to lose weight is to sleep , eh ? But it 's just water weight . You go to bed hydrated , you wake up dehydrated . Bummer.Sleeping for a few days may net you more weight loss , but some of that will be a loss in muscle ton , which will result in making it even harder to lose more weight and a good probability of gaining more weight than you lost.The best way to lose weight is to stop trying to lose weight . Instead , concentrate on improving your health . Yeah , yeah , exercise and eat right . * There 's a lot of details missing in those four words , but the gist is that any attempt to lose weight that does n't involve those activities are just ways of screwing your health for looks . The reason that I say stop trying to lose weight ? Weight is too complex a system to control reliably and any method that involves looking at a scale regularly will have a very good chance of just frustrating you to the point of giving up .",0

"Is salvation for the jews only ? According to Judaism , all the righteous in the world , Jewish or not , have their portion in the world to come.First and foremost , Jews believe strongly in the concept of Chasedei Umos Haolam ( lit . Righteous People of the Nations of the World ) that they are abundantly and lavishly rewarded for their good deeds . So , according to the jewish view , salvation is truly for every good-doer or do-gooder in the world , regardless of faith or heritage.However , for a more in depth discussion , this question is quite tricky . First and foremost , the term `` salvation '' or in hebrew , Yeshua , does not relate to personal salvation , heaven or hell etc.It is not an individualistic concept , but is more specifically used in reference to deliverance from exile , a future messianic era where moshiach , lit . meaning `` an anointed one '' , will bring peace to the world and lead the entire jewish nation to congregate in israel at the future third temple . While there is no temple , the jews are considered a scattered people . This future period is a time of peace for everyone . It is not exclusionary . The world will presumably be business as usual . But people , enlightened by a high ethical and moral understanding , will get along better with each other . And war and strife and fear will not be a staple of daily life ( as they are now , during this period of exile ) . Thus it will be a time of deliverance from persecution and plague for everyone alike.As for going to heaven vs. hell , judaism teaches us not to focus our energies on this aspect of existence so that we do n't constantly think about getting rewarded ( see ethics of our fathers ) . And rather do good deeds for the sake of doing good deeds.All in all , according to judaism , if you 're a good person , you 're going to heaven !",0

"What are the different types of volcano ? How do they differ ? Please provide an example / location . Geologists classify volcanoes in following ways : Cinder cones are the simplest type of volcano . They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent . As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air , it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent to form a circular or oval cone . Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit and rarely rise more than a thousand feet or so above their surroundings . Cinder cones are numerous in western North America as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of the world.Some of the Earth 's grandest mountains are composite volcanoes -- sometimes called stratovolcanoes . They are typically steep-sided , symmetrical cones of large dimension built of alternating layers of lava flows , volcanic ash , cinders , blocks , and bombs and may rise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases . Some of the most conspicuous and beautiful mountains in the world are composite volcanoes , including Mount Fuji in Japan , Mount Cotopaxi in Ecuador , Mount Shasta in California , Mount Hood in Oregon , and Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier in Washington.Shield volcanoes , the third type of volcano , are built almost entirely of fluid lava flows . Flow after flow pours out in all directions from a central summit vent , or group of vents , building a broad , gently sloping cone of flat , domical shape , with a profile much like that of a warrior 's shield . They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of highly fluid lava flows called basalt lava that spread widely over great distances , and then cool as thin , gently dipping sheets . Lavas also commonly erupt from vents along fractures ( rift zones ) that develop on the flanks of the cone . Some of the largest volcanoes in the world are shield volcanoes . In northern California and Oregon , many shield volcanoes have diameters of 3 or 4 miles and heights of 1,500 to 2,000 feet . The Hawaiian Islands are composed of linear chains of these volcanoes including Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the island of Hawaii -- two of the world 's most active volcanoes.Volcanic or lava domes are formed by relatively small , bulbous masses of lava too viscous to flow any great distance ; consequently , on extrusion , the lava piles over and around its vent . A dome grows largely by expansion from within . As it grows its outer surface cools and hardens , then shatters , spilling loose fragments down its sides . Some domes form craggy knobs or spines over the volcanic vent , whereas others form short , steep-sided lava flows known as `` coulees . '' Volcanic domes commonly occur within the craters or on the flanks of large composite volcanoes . The nearly circular Novarupta Dome that formed during the 1912 eruption of Katmai Volcano , Alaska , measures 800 feet across and 200 feet high .",0

"how are babies made ? All mammals , including humans , rely on internal fertilisation through copulation . To deliver the sperm to the female , the male inserts his sexual organ , the penis , into the opening of the vagina , the passage into the female 's other sexual organs . ( This process is a part of copulation . ) Once the male ejaculates , a large number of sperm cells swim toward the ovum.The capacitated spermatozoon and the oocyte meet and interact in the ampulla of the fallopian tube . In mammals , binding of the spermatozoon to the zona pellucida , an extracellular layer surrounding the oocyte , initiates the acrosome reaction . This process releases the enzyme hyaluronidase , which digests the matrix of hyaluronic acid in the vestments surrounding the oocyte . Fusion between the sperm and oocyte plasma membranes follows , allowing the entry of the sperm nucleus , mitochondria , centriole and flagellum into the oocyte . Once the ovum fuses with a single sperm cell , its cell membrane changes , preventing fusion with other sperm.This process ultimately leads to the formation of a diploid cell called a zygote . When the zygote reaches the uterus and implants in the endometrium , the female is said to be pregnant .",0

"Should I start my kids ( 5 and 8 years old ) on skiing or snowboarding first ? I want them to learn both ? I would say skiing , and here is why : The first day out , you want your kids to have a good time . If they get a bad first impression , you could be in for fifteen years of boring vacations sitting on beaches or whatever non-skiers/boarders do on vacations . Anyne will tell you that the first day on a board you spend it on your rear end . I had big purple welts the first time . With skiing , you fall a little bit , but with separate feet you are at least standing most of the time . Secondly , when skiing , you gradually progress over many years to become an avid skier . With snowboarding , you either can snowboard or you ca n't . The kids will want to learn to snowboard , despite the bad first day , once they are into the whole winter sports thing . So use skiing to get them to have a good time , then , once they are parallel skiing , let them snowboard . about 18 years ago , when me and my brother were beginners , he switched to snowboarding . I waited another couple years . Now I do both expertly , and the one time he tried skiing , he broke his leg trying to keep up with me . He never mastered skiing because he could n't appreciate the slower learning process of the sport . kids are impatient . If they have a bad first ten minutes they want to go home . If it is too much work to learn something similar to something they are already good at , they wo n't learn it . good luck .",0

"What should I do ? My ex-boyfriend and I have been having a on-again off-again relationship for 4 years . This past year we broke out again , he usually calls me at least 2 weeks later to try to patch things up but this time he did n't . I moved on a talked to this dude for 5 months and I just did not feel him like I did my ex , so I broke it off with him because I can not string people along that . I decided to call my ex . He did n't answer the phone , then about an hour later he called . He think that he was at work because we only talk for about 5 min . and he said that he would call me back . I was not expecting a call , but he did later that night . We talk for a little while catching up , but I could tell that he was tired and he told me he was about to go to sleep . He has n't called since . But yesterday when I was getting out of class he pulled up to my car and he really did not saying anything it was like we were talking in silent . And we just got in our cars and we did not say bye . I still love him what to do It sounds like you too have a deep connection , he called you and you keep loving him and thinking about him plus you two talked `` in silence '' too its as if you have a body language connection as well.I think you two should try being together again , try another date and tell him how much you enjoy his company and his personality and how people make mistakes.that might bring him back too you.hope this helps .",0

"Do vitamins and other supplements really benefit you ? I am the world 's pickiest eater . I do not eat vegetables and I rarly eat fruit . Little meat and a lot of carbs . But I still want to stay healthy . So I want to know if this is a good way to do so without changing the way I am ? The human body comprises chemical compounds such as water , amino acids ( proteins ) , fatty acids ( lipids ) , nucleic acids ( DNA/RNA ) , and carbohydrates ( e.g . sugars ) . These compounds in turn consist of elements such as carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , and phosphorus , and may or may not contain minerals such as calcium , iron , and zinc . Minerals also ubiquitously occur in the form of salts and electrolytes . All of these chemical compounds and elements occur in various forms and combinations ( e.g . hormones/vitamins , phospholipids , hydroxyapatite ) , both in the human body and in organisms ( e.g . plants , animals ) that humans eat.The human body must necessarily comprise those elements that humans eat and absorb into the bloodstream . The digestive system , except in the unborn fetus , is the first step in helping to make the different chemical compounds and elements in food available for the trillions of cells of the body . In the digestive process of an average adult , about seven litres of liquid , known as digestive juices , exit the internal body and enter the lumen of the digestive tract . The digestive juices help break chemical bonds between ingested compounds as well as modulate the conformation and/or energetic state of the compounds/elements . Yet many compounds/elements are absorbed into the bloodstream unchanged , though the digestive process helps to release them from the matrix of the foods where they occur . Any unabsorbed matter is eliminated in the feces . Only a minimal amount of digestive juice is eliminated this way ; the intestines reabsorb most of it otherwise the body would rapidly dehydrate ( hence the devastating effects of persistent diarrhea ) .Study in this field must take into careful account the state of the body before ingestion and after digestion as well as the chemical content of both the food and the waste . The specific types of compounds and elements that are absorbed by the body can be determined by comparing the waste to the food . The effect that the absorbed matter has on the body can be determined by finding the difference between the pre-ingestion state and the post-digestion state . The effect may only be discernible after an extended period of time in which all food and ingestion must be exactly regulated and all waste must be analyzed . The number of variables ( e.g . 'confounding factors ' ) involved in this type of experimentation is very high . This makes scientifically valid nutritional study very time-consuming and expensive , which accounts for why a proper science of human nutrition is rather new.In general , eating a variety of fresh , whole ( unprocessed ) foods has proven hormonally and metabolically favourable compared to eating a monotonous diet based on processed foods . In particular , fresh , whole foods provide higher amounts and a more favourable balance of essential and vital nutrients per unit of energy , resulting in better management of cell growth , maintenance , and mitosis ( cell division ) as well as of appetite and energy balance . A generally more regular eating pattern ( e.g . eating medium-sized meals every 3 to 4 hours ) has also proven more hormonally and metabolically favourable than infrequent , haphazard food intake.Vitamins give you a complement among all the nutrients your body requires . It is not advisable at all to substitute entirely your meals with vitamins and dietary or food supplements . I recommend you to look for a nutritional advisor and discuss in which way you can adjust your meals , having all the necessary elements your body needs , plus , eating only what you like .",0

"do i have to send thank you notes for christmas ? The rule is ... if the giver is in a different house from you , you NEED to send one . Do n't just send a blank one though ! Here is a fabulous guide on what to say : There is a six-point formula to the proper thank-you : Learn it , know it , memorize it – and it will never fail you.1 . Greet the Giver Dear Aunt Sally , That ’ s the easy part , but you ’ d be surprised how many people forget it . Dale Carnegie taught us people love to hear their own names and Direct Marketing is sure we also love to read them in ink . That ’ s right , ink . Blue-black is always the number-one choice , but black will suffice in a pinch . Don ’ t let a whimsical marker color be the most stunning part of your note : instead let the words sing without the amplification of rainbow hues . Even if your handwriting is poor , you must still hand-write your notes . Do not type them or , worse , use a word processor . No excuses.2 . Express Your Gratitude Thank you so much for the slippers.This first paragraph seems like it would be the easiest , but it is actually the most complicated . Beware the just writing trap . You are not ‘ just writing to say ’ as in I am just writing to say ; that ’ s stating the obvious . If the giver is reading , clearly you have already written . Therefore use the present-perfect tense , which essentially means write as if whatever you say is happening in the moment.Also – and this is important – never directly mention money . ‘ Thank you for the hundred bucks ’ could instead be ‘ Thank you for your generosity. ’ All cash denominations become ‘ your generosity ’ or ‘ your kindness. ’ If you feel the giver overspent , the farthest you can go is appreciated : ‘ Your generosity is appreciated , ’ or ‘ It is such an extravagant gift – your kindness is appreciated. ’ If you ’ re writing to thank someone for an intangible ( such as them putting you up at their place while you were in town for the weekend ) , first define what the intangible thing is , and then make the gift sound as attractive as possible . In other words , don ’ t say : ‘ Thanks for letting us crash at your place. ’ Instead say : ‘ Thank you for your hospitality. ’ Don ’ t worry if it sounds too simple ; the point of writing the note is to create a simple expression of a heartfelt sentiment.3 . Discuss Use It gets very chilly here in the winter , so they will get a lot of use when winter comes.Say something nice about the item and how you will use it . Let ’ s say it ’ s something you actually love and use incessantly – then say so : ‘ Ever since I got the slippers I have only taken them off to shower and go to work . I ’ d wear them to the office if I thought I could get away with it. ’ But don ’ t lie , even though some etiquette books may tell you it ’ s okay . After all , there ’ s always a truth that can be extracted . Let ’ s say you hate the slippers . How to say thanks ? Find the one thing about them that ’ s nice and discuss it – but don ’ t get carried away . ‘ They are such a lovely shade of blue ’ works , and is more honest than ‘ These slippers make my heart sing like a choir of angels , ’ which is overkill . If it was a gesture , like letting you stay at their place , you can follow the lines of ‘ It ’ s so nice to make a personal connection while traveling . I really appreciated my time with your family. ’ If the gift was cash , allude to how you will use the money , but do not itemize your planned purchases line by line , instead simply say : ‘ It will be a great help when we purchase our new home/toaster/lava lamp/whatever. ’ You can get arty here , but not flowery . It ’ s a fine line . Small , realistic statements like ‘ I put the flowers on the kitchen table and they are still looking fresh and beautiful after a week , ’ or ‘ I don ’ t know which is more fun , actually using the Cuisinart , or reading recipes and thinking I could do that in the Cuisinart ! ’ Having fun is alright , so have at it.4 .

"american culture values ? Interesting question . If you refer to an identity for american culture , my guess is that identity comes from multiculturalism , the meeting point of various cultures and cultural values and cultural viewpoints . America ( both as a continent and as the US of A ) is home to so many nationalities that one might get lost in trying to find what American culture is about or what being an american really is.So my opinion is that multi ( or pluriculturalism , not sure which is best used ) is the identifier here . At least it should be , because an environment which harbors such diversity should promote understanding , empathy and coexistance for those cultures which are part of it , something that the USA declares itself to be upholding , but its internal and external policies seem to disagree .",0

"Which is the fastest computer in the world ? Well , there are three perspectives to your question , which are as follows : ( 1 ) A super computer ( 2 ) A desktop computer ( 3 ) Anything in a general sense that can compute.For the third perspective , The fastest computer in the world is much faster than the desktop in front of you , and it is sitting right on top of your shoulders ! The human brain is an amazing computing device and the fastest processor available right now . In supercomputers , the BlueGene/L - eServer Blue Gene Solution stationed at DOE/NNSA/LLNL at Livermore in California is ruling the world . It has , hold on your breath , 131072 processors , each processor with an individual performance of 2.8 GigaFlops ( PowerPC 440 700 MHz ) . It has a main memory of 32768 GB and is 3 times more powerful in processing than its immediate competitor ( Also by IBM ) . Surprisingly , its still in expansion phase . Blue Gene is an IBM Research project dedicated to exploring the frontiers in supercomputing : in computer architecture , in the software required to program and control massively parallel systems , and in the use of computation to advance our understanding of important biological processes such as protein folding.As for the fastest desktop configuration , it keeps changing every now and then . An interesting fact to note , Intel had come up with 4GHz chip , but could not commercialize it because of the excessive heating which could damage the chip . Hope to see such a chip soon . As on 6th January 2006 , Xi MTower 64 AGE-SLI is considered to be the fastest desktop Computer .

"What is your opinion of scientific medicine ... ? Do you think doctors , drug companies , etc . have ( in general ) our best interest in mind ? Do you think we have become a society too dependent on pills ? Do you think there is a real , significant benefit to using herbs and natural `` cures '' and preventatives as opposed to either using `` medicine '' or not using anything ? How do you deal with the people who think you are a quack for believing in natural remedies ? That 's quite a bit to sort through . I 'll do my best.I believe that individual doctors almost always have the best interests of their patients in mind . Medicine as a whole , however , is far more interested in the bottom line . This applies especially to the drug companies . From what I understand certain diseases do n't have enough people suffering from them to make it profitable to research treatments for them . Or , if the research has been done , there is not enough profit in manufacturing drugs to treat these people . I 've even read that there are boutique chemists who make , by hand , very small runs of certain drugs at no profit to themselves , simply to help out.As far as I 'm concerned , this is inexcusable . Do I have a solution ? No . Are alternative treatments viable ? I 'm sure that sometimes they are and sometimes they are not . Again , the problem comes down to making a buck . People who are suffering are , unfortunately , easy marks and snake-oil-salesmen have known this since the dawn of civilization.The problem becomes sorting the con-men from the well-meaning , but dangerously untrained , from the people with actual remedies . This is very difficult and requires a tremendous amount of work on the part of people who often lack the time and energy to do the necessary legwork because they are sick.Coretta Scott King died seeking medical help from a quack . It is awful that she suffered such an undignified end , but as long as there are people to be taken advantage of , others will do their best to part them from their money . Obviously not all alternative treatments are quackery , but they often get lumped together because of the actions of a few ( many , actually ) bad apples . I would suggest that the alternative-therapy industry engage in harsher self-policing as a way to remove the undeserved black-mark.As for you responding to questions which are specifically targeted at individuals , I welcome this . The thing that I like most about Yahoo Answers is that it is a place that encourages the free exchange of ideas between anybody . I do n't think that anyone can , or should , get upset when a targeted question receives several answers . That 's the best thing about this place . So , feel free to throw your two cents in anytime . I really appreciate your response about Bush and Christians . I 'd be very curious to hear what this man , who presumes to speak for all Christian Americans would have to say about that . Thanks for your input .",0

"definition of discovery teaching approach ? The discovery method is a teaching technique that encourages students to take a more active role in their learning process by answering a series of questions or solving problems designed to introduce a general concept . In this teaching approach , the instructor guides the student ’ s thought process by posing a series of questions whose responses would lead to the understanding of a concept before it is explicitly stated . “ Children act as detectives as they solve concept-attainment activities in stimulating learning environments . In doing so , they place a newly introduced object in a category that they have previously discovered or identified. ” This teaching method is believed to increase retention of material because the student organizes the new information and integrates it with information that has already been stored .",0
"how are the moon and the sun visible at the same time ? Draw a big circle to represent the sun.Draw a medium circle to represent the earth.Now , between the two circles , draw a tiny circle to represent the moon.The moon casts a shadow on the earth . Imagine that you are in the shadow . What you are seeing is an eclipse . You only see the moon.Wait a couple minutes and the moon will move away from the sun . Now you can see both the sun and the moon.The moon can continue moving away from the sun for a long time and you will still be able to see it.Usually , you can see the sun and moon at the same time because , most of the time , they are not on opposite sides of the earth . An exception is when there is a full moon , or nearly full moon . In that case , the sun and moon are on opposite sides of the earth and you can only see one at a time .",0

"Why do people not help others as a matter of course ? If I meet someone , and they need help of some kind , I do everything in my power to help them . Others will say 'I 'm too busy , ' or 'That 's their problem ' . What has happened to the world ? It has sadly become far too focused on itself . If you need more proof , just take a look around at the number of people engaged in a cell phone conversation in public.It seems to me our entire culture has turned in on itself , making it ever more convenient to separate ourselves from the world . Technology has become a double-edged sword , providing us with amazing new ways to be more productive and organized , but often at the expense of human interaction . Communicaton and entertainment devices provide us with amazing mobility , but our Blackberrys and iPods only further cut us off from one another.Of course , technology is n't the whole problem . Our culture has also become incredibly jaded and disenfranchised , always expecting the worst from others and usually getting it . We use childish , egotistical athletes as role models , making life all about `` getting paid '' . Our fascination with celebrity has become an obsession -- just check out the ratings for `` reality '' shows . And our domestic and international political views are too often shaped by sound bites and media talking heads . Apparently it 's just easier to agree with someone than figure it out yourself.I do n't believe it has to be like this . Our technological advancements do n't have to come with a price that devalues our very existence . And we do not just have to accept that the world with all its troubles is simply beyond redemption . We simply have to want to be involved in the lives of others . How do we do that ? Parents have to care more about their kids ' relationships with others ( not to mention their own ) than they do about making sure they 're doing the right things . We have to educate on how to use technology to collaborate , instead of to isolate . We have to look harder for our heroes . Let 's face it -- the one thing 9/11 taught Americans was who they really were . In short , we all have to love ourselves and life and be obsessed about them less .",0

"who are muslims ? A Muslim is a believer in or follower of Islam . The word Muslim means one who submits and implies complete submission to the will of God ( Allah ) . Muslims believe that nature is itself Islamic , since it follows natural laws placed by God . Thus , a Muslim strives to surrender to God 's commands every step of the way.Until recently the word was also spelled Moslem . Muslims do not recommend this spelling because it is often pronounced `` mawzlem , '' which sounds like an Arabic word for `` oppressor . '' Many English-language writers used to call Muslims `` Mohammedans '' or `` Mahometans '' , meaning `` followers of Mohammed '' , but this terminology is considered incorrect and insulting , because Muslims believe it implies that they worship the prophet Muhammad , contrary to the fundamental principles of Islam itself.Sources of IslamSunni sources of IslamThe Holy Quran Ahadith ( singular Hadith ) - recordings of the life of the Prophet Muhammad , reported by any one of his companions .

"Why Muslims do n't condemn the threats of Islamists to kill the danish cartoonists ? Iread today and i was upset that a Pakistani cleric promised bounty on the head of the cartoonist . like living in middle-ages or stone-ages where ppl got bounties on their head because of their opinion . of course there are more than one , but the cleric , as usual as many clerics , is ignorant probably took his information from somewhere : '' He said the mosque and his religious school would give $ 25,000 and a car , while a local jewelers ' association would give another $ 1 million . No representative of the association was available to confirm it had made the offer . `` This is a unanimous decision of by all imams ( prayer leaders ) of Islam that whoever insults the prophet deserves to be killed and whoever will take this insulting man to his end , will get this prize , '' Qureshi said . `` http : //news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060217/ap_on_re_mi_ea/prophet_drawingsWhy do n't you if you muslims do n't condemn such act openly ? if you are non-Muslim , how can we protect those innocent cartoonists ? To answer your original question , it is because Islam will NOT hold their fellow Muslims accountable for their actions.When asked of a Muslim , why doesn ’ t the Islamic majority in the United Nation condemn the thousands of terrorist acts perpetrated by those of your faith ? The answer comes back , “ We can not judge our Muslim brothers . Only Allah can judge them. ” Yet when it comes to judging the infidel , there are no holds barred . Now , let us contrast this attitude with what the Bible teaches.1 Corinthians 5:11-13For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside ? Do you not judge those who are inside ? But those who are outside God judges.This is the polar opposite to Islam . The Bible teaches that the Christian is to judge the actions of other Christians and call them on the carpet if they are doing ANYTHING unbiblical . However , those who are NOT believers , the Christian is to leave alone , that only GOD will judge them.So there is the contrast . If Islam was really concerned about peace , and was a peaceful religion , they would do something to stop these violent people . But do n't hold your breath .",0

China has it 's eyes on the entire region -- the entire world for that matter.I think we 're safe for at least a few more years ... maybe even as many as 10 .

It must be understood that this is n't `` inevitable '' just because China has the manpower . It is thought that it will happen because China pretty much says that it is going to happen . China , though it just loves to cater to the US 's cheep labor force needs , is openly anti-American . The students learn about the US as an evil empire . So is it truly `` inevitable '' ? I think the relationship between the US and China could change -- I think we could possibly become friends . But it is much more likely that in the future China will show aggression to the US or the US 's interest that will lead us into war .",0

"How to deal with my 10 yrs old daughter that is always late and seems she does n't understand that time goes by Some people do not have good concepts of time regardless of what others tell them . It might be in part due to ADD or some other cognitive issue or that they might become so present in each moment that they are unable to think about anything else mundane and necessary such as time and that they have to conform to it 's limits . ADD can have bizarre opposites like not being aware of or focused enough to notice something like time , but then being so focused on what you 're doing that you are unaware of time ... Contrary but it occurs . But please do n't rush to drugs if you find they have ADD . Drugs are n't always the answer and can have horrible side effects , ritalin is just pharmaceutical speed . Awareness and education and remaining involved in an activity they love is the best bet for ADD-like issues.Talk to her nicely about it . Explain that unfortunately in this modern world , one we do n't have much of a choice about living in unless we want to live in the woods , have to conform to a little to be able to get along and function well in . Help her understand what the consequences of time management are about and the downfalls of it to herself and to others . Nicely of course . No pressure but engage her conscience so that she feels responsible for the affect she has upon another person when she is late . You can also enlist tools such as a large clock that she can understand with hands/dials or digital numbers . Help her practice what time she begins something , how long she will be at it and then when she will stop that activity to begin another ... etc . Or a timer that she can set for a distinct amount of time so that when it goes off she knows she has something she has to get ready for next and allows her time to plan . Ask her what her beliefs are about time and her responsibility to others is in regards to being on time . Ask her what 's going on , engage her opinion even if she has to figure it out as you go . It will help her become conscious of the situation beyond your frustration and into her role in it.Look into different methods in the educational department or section for kids with learning disabilities ( even if she does n't have one ) . The resources are good and you can use them to your advantage , like I said even if she does n't have one . Good luck !",0
"Why does an apple is refered to a kid or learning ? I sometimes see an apple along with a student or a kid . From wikipedia : '' In the United States , Denmark and Sweden , an apple ( polished ) is a traditional gift for a teacher . This stemmed from the fact that teachers during the 16th to 18th centuries were poorly paid , so parents would compensate the teacher by providing food . As apples were a very common crop , teachers would often be given baskets of apples by students . As wages increased , the quantity of apples was toned down to a single fruit . `` So I guess it was so common that it become a symbol for teaching and learning .",0

"Where is the gum ? I was told that my gum is healthy if I can see less than 4mm of it . But I thought the gum is the flesh connecting the teeth to the jaw , and I can see the entire pink flesh covering my teeth . There must be at least 1.5cm . How can it be less than 4mm ? Am I missing something ? The 4 mm probably refers to the depth of your gum pockets ( the space betwen the top of your gums to the alveolar bone that holds your teeth . Your dentist would measure this with a probe.If your pockets are deeper than 4 mm then it means that you have had bone loss which is usually caused by periodontal disease ( an infection in the gums ) . The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly ( brush at least twice a day for two minutes ) . I emphasize flossing , because often people do n't realize just how important it is . The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck , and therefore where bacteria sticks most often , too . The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch . So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth , you want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure you remove the plaque . So you should be going up and down two to three times along the tooth on both sides of the contact.Hope this helps !",0
"who is known to be the best united states of america 's president ? Several Presidents presided over particularly troubling times in our history . Or gained land for us.Reagan ended the Cold War . FDR - Led us out of the depression and through most of WWII . Theodore Roosevelt - forged the panama canal . Without it we 'd have to go all the way are South America to get onto the west coast by ship . Abe Lincoln - Held the course and would not let our country become divided into two separate nations . Thomas Jefferson - Gave us the Louisiana purchase doubling the size of our country . John Adams - gave us a strong Navy to prevent attacks while our nation was still weak . George Washington - Forged the path of what a president of the United States should be , by laying the ground work for generations to come . Each these Presidents made this country what it is today . Without them our country and the world at large would be a totaly different place . To pick one among them would be unfair as the presidency is not a sprint , by one man , but a race where the torch is passed to each succeeding person .",0

Why do people cut and paste 4 pages into the answer box instead of answering themselves ! ? I hate losing the best answer to someone who pastes half a book from some other website when my answer is the same but coming out of my head . Anyone else think cutting and pasting is cheating / plagiarizing ? Well there r different types of quiz masters here - some of them need detailed information regarding certain subjects ; certain others who r trying to test others ' general/specific knowledge ; certain others who r just time wasters ; some others who really need help - sympathisers ; and of course certain half cracks ! People cut and paste long answers because they are 'long ' - they do not have the time to type it - they could help other genuine quizzers . Further some of the answers are easily available on the net - for such people the best answer is just a link or even more punishing - copying & pasting it so that they are forced to read it !,0

"what do you know about SOURASHTRA ? Sourashtra ( alternate names and spellings : Palkar , Sowrashtra , Saurashtra , Saurashtri , Patnuli ) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in parts of the Southern Indian State of Tamil Nadu . The Ethnologue puts the number of speakers at 310,000 ( 1997 IMA ) , although the actual number could be double this figure or even more.ClassificationSourashtra is a Indo-Aryan language belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family.Geographical DistributionThe speakers of the Sourashtra language , known as Sourashtrians , maintain a predominant presence in Madurai , a city in the southern part of Tamil Nadu . Though official figures are hard to come by , it is believed that the Sourashtra population makes up for about one-third of the city 's total population . They are present in significant numbers in the cities of Dindigul , Paramakudi , Erode , Palani , Rajapalayam , Nilakottai , Salem , Thanjavur , Trichy , Kumbakonam , Thiruvarur and Kottar ( Nagercoil ) . A sizable number is also found in Chennai , Bangalore and other parts of India , but this presence is largely due to small-scale migrations in the last few decades from one of the aforesaid traditional Sourashtrian settlements.It is also believed that Sourashtra speakers exist , albeit in small numbers , in other southern states such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka . However , in the absence of any reliable facts to substantiate this claim , this remains a speculation at best.HistoryThough there is little historical evidence available to support the argument that the Sourashtrians lived in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat in Western India , folklore , and recent linguistic and genetic researches have been able to establish that this region was indeed once the habitat of the Sourashtrians . However , their language has more similarities with Marathi and Konkani , both Indo-Aryan languages of Western India , than it does with Modern Gujarati , the language of present-day Gujarat . Linguists have been able to explain why it is so : Both Sourashtra and Gujarati branched off from a common parent , and have since taken completely different paths to modernity . Gujarati came under the influence of Persian , Arabic , many tribal languages and Hindi , whereas Sourashtra , taking off from Gujarat before it had made any Muslim contact , was influenced by Marathi , Konkani , Kannada , Telugu , and finally , Tamil . It has been acknowledged that Persian and Arabic have had only limited influence on Marathi and Konkani , and this is why they still retain a good amount of vocabulary and grammar derived from Sanskrit , as compared to other daughter languages of Sanskrit . It is possible that the vocabulary and grammar shared between Modern Sourashtra and Marathi is what was originally derived from Sanskrit.The southward flight of the Sourashtrians seems to have been triggered by the frequent Muslim invasions of their homeland and the instability caused by it . No details are available as to whether it was a mass-migration and when it took place . They found the safe haven they were looking for in the Vijayanagar Kingdom , with its capital at Hampi in present-day Karnataka , which was then expanding southwards . They , whose traditional occupation was weaving , were able to impress upon the Emperor with their weaving skills , and soon were elevated to the position of Royal Weavers . Telugu and Kannada were the court languages , though other languages such as Sanskrit and Tamil were also in use . It was during this period that Sourashtra started absorbing Telugu and Kannada words into its lexicon.Vijayanagar rulers had the practice of appointing Governors , known as Nayaks , to manage far-flung regions of the empire . When Madurai and Thanjavur were annexed to the empire , Governors were appointed to administer the new territories . It is believed that a part of the Sourashtra community moved to Madurai and Thanjavur to serve the Governors . ****Hey why di they suspend you from yahoo*****",0

You did n't say what the penalty was for ( late filing , late payment , interest , trust fund penalties , etc. ) . Nor did you state who is handling your dispute ( IRS Appeals , Collection Due Process , Tax Court ) . There 's slightly different rules depending on what 's going on.The basic process for handling penalties and disputes is outlined on the IRS website.In general , the IRS will investigate whether you are responsible for the penalty , and will send up a notice informing you that the penalty was waived or that you really do owe the penalty . Interest will accrue if you really do owe the penalty , but you have n't paid it yet.Generally , I advise my clients to pay all penalties in full , and then dispute the penalties . This shows a good faith effort , and stops additional penalties and interest from being added to the account . If we lose the dispute , at least the client paid only the penalty and not additional interest . If we win , the client gets his money back.I hope this helps . Let us know how your dispute with the IRS turns out.Best wishes.William",0

"In calculus , could you explain the process of intergrating by substitution ? teacher doesnt explain very well When you are doing integrations , all you are doing is computing an area under a curve . Sometimes the formula for the area will be obvious to you , from something you already know or recognize . Othertimes , you have to transform the problem into one you know already . This is the method called integration by substitution . For example , suppose you want to integrate the function sqrt ( 1 - x^2 ) with respect to x , between some limits . Most times , you will not remember or recognize this integral . However , you might remember that sqrt ( 1- ( sin a ) ^2 ) is cos a , which you know how to integrate , and therefore if you let x=sin a , you have transformed the integral into one you recognize and can easily solve . There is a HUGE amount of material written on this on the internet and in books , but this should get you started . All you are doing is transforming the problem into one that you can solve easier .",0

First and foremost , stay away from any ab machine.For the upper abs , focus on crunches which effectively work the abdominals better than sit-ups or any machine on the market.For the lower abs , keep in mind there is very little muscle tissue there so decreasing levels of body fat is the most effective way to bring out the best in this area . Hanging leg raises , v-situps and reverse curls are among some of the best exercise for this region .

Also , you will need to invest years into managerial jobs that will lead you up the ladder.OR - you can get a geat idea for some computer related start-up and get some venture capital and become successful ... however , lots of startups can ( and do ) fail.If your looking for a quick buck - sell drugs - but then go to jail or get killed.It 's really finding out what YOU like to do and then make it your life 's ambition to make it into a high paying job . Look at Bill Gates - he took a `` hobby '' and made it a life long goal . Not only that but he is wealthy more than I am sure he even dreamed he could be .",0

"Wht are the reqs for becoming a licensed psychiatrist in Florida ? Do you need a PhD or do you just need certification ? I 've just started looking into this as a career option & am sort of lost as to what to do or where to go for some complete answers . My intent , if at all possible , is to attend an online college , such as Capella . Thanks for the help ! In order to be a psychiatrist you need to attend an tradtional college/university and earn a BA or BS . Then you need to make sure that you have the required prerequisite classes for medical school which is inorganic chemistry I and II , organic chemistry I and II , physics I and II , biology I and II , 6-9 gredit hours of english/ english lit.. And some schools require that an applicant has calculus and 3-9 hours of behavioral sciences . And do n't forget to take the MCAT , have good recommendations , maybe volunteer at a hospital etc.. Then apply to medical school in which you will earn either a MD or DO depending on what program you want to be in . ( A psychiatrist has earned either an MD or DO . ) After you graduate from medical school , you need to enter a psychiatry residency ( I do n't know how long the residency program lasts , maybe 2-3 years ? ) . But , if you want to be a psychologist , you still need a BA or BS and then go to gradtuate school for psychology and earn a PhD . Be careful not to confuse a psychiatrist with a psychologist . A psychiatrist is a medical doctor ( M.D . or D.O . ) who writes out prescriptions and decides whether physical and mental disorders are from physical or psychological origins . A psychologist , however , is a doctor of philosophy ( Ph.D ) or a doctor of psychology ( Psy.D ) . Those are not medical degrees , and a psychologist can not prescribe medicine . But in order to become either one , you need to earn a B.A or B.S . first and have very good grades .",0

"What is the theory of relativity ? I have gotten mixed information on this subject , and would like to know the truth . Any resources would be great . Wellrelativity Physical theory , introduced by Albert Einstein , that discards the concept of absolute motion and instead treats only relative motion between two systems or frames of reference . One consequence of the theory is that space and time are no longer viewed as separate , independent entities but rather are seen to form a four-dimensional continuum called space-time . Full comprehension of the mathematical formulation of the theory can be attained only through a study of certain branches of mathematics , e.g. , tensor calculus . Both the special and general theories have been established and accepted into the structure of physics . Einstein also sought unsuccessfully for many years to incorporate the theory into a unified field theory valid also for subatomic and electromagnetic phenomena.Evolution from Classical TheoryThe modern theory is an extension of the simpler Galilean or Newtonian concept of relativity , which holds that the laws of mechanics are the same in one system as in another system in uniform motion relative to it . Thus , it is impossible to detect the motion of a system by measurements made within the system , and such motion can be observed only in relation to other systems in uniform motion . The older concept of relativity assumes that space and time are correctly measured separately and regards them as absolute and independent realities . The system of relativity and mechanics of Galileo and Newton is perfectly self-consistent , but the addition of Maxwell 's theory of electricity and magnetism to the system leads to fundamental theoretical difficulties related to the problem of absolute motion .",0

"Is drinking coffee bad for you ? Here are some of the benefits and risk of drinking coffee.BenefitsCoffee increases the effectiveness of pain killers—especially migraine medications—and can rid some people of asthma . Some of the beneficial effects may be restricted to one sex , for instance it has been shown to reduce the occurrence of gallstones and gallbladder disease in men . Coffee intake may reduce one 's risk of diabetes mellitus type 2 by up to half . While this was originally noticed in patients who consumed high amounts ( 7 cups a day ) , the relationship was later shown to be linear ( Salazar-Martinez 2004 ) .Coffee can also reduce the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver and prevent colon and bladder cancers . Coffee can reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma , a variety of liver cancer ( Inoue , 2005 ) . Also , coffee reduces the incidence of heart disease , though whether this is simply because it rids the blood of excess fat or because of its stimulant effect is unknown . At the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Washington , D.C. , on August 28 , 2005 , chemist Joe Vinson of the University of Scranton presented his analysis showing that for Americans , who as a whole do not consume large quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables , coffee represents by far the largest source of valuable antioxidants in the diet . [ 4 ] Coffee contains the anticancer compound methylpyridinium . This compound is not present in significant amounts in other food materials . Methylpyridinium is not present in raw coffee beans but is formed during the roasting process from trigonellin , which is common in raw coffee beans . It is present in both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee , and even in instant coffee . 6Coffee is also a powerful stimulant for peristalsis and is sometimes considered to prevent constipation ; it is also a diuretic.Many people drink coffee for its ability to increase short term recall and increase IQ . It also changes the metabolism of a person so that their body burns a higher proportion of lipids to carbohydrates , which can help athletes avoid muscle fatigue.Some of these health effects are realized by as little as 4 cups a day ( 24 U.S. fl oz , 700 mL ) , but others occur at 5 or more cups a day ( 32 U.S. fl oz or 0.95 L or more ) .Some controversy over these effects exists , since by its nature coffee consumption is associated with other behavioral variables . Therefore it has been variously suggested that the cognitive effects of caffeine are limited to those who have not developed a tolerance , or to those who have developed a tolerance and are caffeine-deprived.Practitioners in alternative medicine often recommend coffee enemas for `` cleansing of the colon '' due to its stimulus of peristalsis , although mainstream medicine has not proved any benefits of the practice.RisksMany notable effects of coffee are related to its caffeine content.Many coffee drinkers are familiar with `` coffee jitters '' , a nervous condition that occurs when one has had too much caffeine . Coffee can also increase blood pressure among those with high blood pressure , but follow-up studies showed that coffee still decreased the risk of dying from heart disease in the aggregate . Coffee can also cause insomnia in some , while paradoxically it helps a few sleep more soundly . It can also cause anxiety and irritability , in some with excessive coffee consumption , and some as a withdrawal symptom . There are also gender-specific effects , in some PMS sufferers it increases the symptoms , and it can reduce fertility in women , also it may increase the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women , and there may be risks to a fetus if a pregnant woman drinks 8 or more cups a day ( 48 U.S. fl oz or 1.4 L or more ) .A February 2003 Danish study of 18,478 women linked heavy coffee consumption during pregnancy to significantly increased risk of stillbirths ( but no significantly increased risk of infant death in the first year ) . `` The results",0

"Do non-smokers have rights too ?

When will American ’ s stop being hypocrites to smokers by rapping smokers of their money and health and then yelling at smokers for providing tax money to all of America ? If we truly cared about America we would find ways to make tobacco illegal and give up the revenue from tobacco.PS : I have not had a cigarette for 12 Days . . . No I ’ m not moody from withdrawals , I just think American ’ s are hypocrites when it comes to smokers . Sin/Use taxes are somewhat better than illegalizing sin/use completely . At least then the ills caused by the sin or damage by the use are paid for by those doing the sin/use . Example : Road use..polution.. gas tax , is both a use and sin tax .

"Is religion a mental illness ? Philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote : '' Religion is based mainly upon fear : fear of the mysterious , fear of defeat , fear of death .

I regard it as a disease born of fear and as a source of untold misery to the human race . `` Believing in fictional characters and events without any proof , affirming your own life in a system of delusions , is n't that a form of schizophrenia ? Feeling that some God is watching you at all times and that your actions are ethically important because you may win or lose cookie points with that deity , not because of their intrinsic moral value , is n't that paranoia ?

"What is a worm , trojan ? and how is it different from a computer virus ? Trojan horse is a malicious program that is disguised as legitimate software.A Trojan horse program has a useful and desired function , or at least it has the appearance of having such . In most cases the program performs other , undesired functions , but not always . The useful , or seemingly useful , functions serve as camouflage for these undesired functions . The kind of undesired functions are not part of the definition of a Trojan Horse ; they can be of any kind.In practice , Trojan Horses in the wild often contain spying functions ( such as a packet sniffer ) or backdoor functions that allow a computer , unbeknownst to the owner , to be remotely controlled from the network , creating a `` zombie computer '' . Because Trojan horses often have these harmful functions , there often arises the misunderstanding that such functions define a Trojan Horse.The basic difference from computer viruses is : a Trojan horse is technically a normal computer program and does not possess the means to spread itself . Originally Trojan horses were not designed to spread themselves . They relied on fooling people to allow the program to perform actions that they would otherwise not have voluntarily performed . Trojans of recent times also contain functions and strategies that enable their spreading . This moves them closer to the definition of computer viruses , and it becomes difficult to clearly distinguish such mixed programs between Trojan horses and viruses .",0

"What is the real % of possibilities of getting aids from oral sex in case there are no obvious wounds ? The risk of becoming infected with HIV through unprotected ( without a condom ) oral sex is lower than that of unprotected anal or vaginal sex . However , a lower-risk activity will increase in risk when it is done often enough . The Options Project found that 7.8 % ( 8 of 102 ) of recently infected men who have sex with men in San Francisco were probably infected through oral sex . Nearly half ( 3 of 8 ) of these cases reported oral problems , including occasional bleeding gums . Almost all ( 7 of 8 ) of these men reported to have had oral contact with pre-semen or semen.The risk of oral sex transmission ( 8 % ) in this study is higher than many researchers had previously thought or found in other studies . More media attention appeared to be placed on this particular study , probably because of the higher number of study participants . There appears to be evidence that higher-risk activities ( anal sex ) among men who have sex with men is decreasing while lower-risk activities ( oral sex ) among these men is increasing . Oral sex has always been considered a lower-risk activity but is certainly not risk free .",0

"was there a man named john appleseed ... ..and did he start out in illonoise ? Johnny Appleseed in real life was one John Chapman , born on September 26,1774 near Leominster , Massachusetts . Little is known of his early life , but he apparently received a good education which helped him in his later years . By the time he was 25 years old , he had become a nursery man and had planted apple trees in the western portions of New York and Pennsylvania . Some of the orchards in those areas were said to have originated with his apple trees.When the rich and fertile lands lying south of the Great Lakes and west of the Ohio river were opened for settlement in the early 1800 's , John Chapman was among the very first to explore the new territory . This was the Northwest Territory from which the states of Ohio , Michigan , Indiana , and Illinois were later formed . For nearly half a century Johnny Appleseed roamed his territory . When settlers arrived , they found John Chapman 's young apple trees ready for sale . In the years that followed , he became known as the Apple Tree Man , or Johnny Appleseed.His manner of operation was simple . He went into the wildreness with a bag of apple seeds on his back until he found a likely spot for planting . There he would clear the land by chopping out weeds and brush by hand . Then he planted his apple seeds in neat rows and built a brush fence around the area to keep out straying animals . His nurseries varied in size . Some were only an acre or so , others covered many acres.He did all of the work himself , living alone for weeks at a time with only the Indians and wild animals for companionship . He never carried a gun or weapon of any kind . He was a deeply religious man who lived by the Golden Rule and had no fear of man or beast . Indians accepted him as a friend , and he is reputed to have talked at times to the wild animals who watched him as he worked in his nurseries . Undoubtedly , they sensed his kind and gentle nature . Once , it is reported , he was caught in a snow storm and crept into a hollow fallen tree for shelter . He found it occupied by a hibernating bear and her cubs , but spent the night there nonetheless . There is no report , however , of how much space he kept between them and himself.John Chapman was a practical businessman as well as a sincere Christian . Somewhere , somehow , he had caught a vision of the winderness blossoming with apple trees , orchard after orchard of carefully nurtured trees , whose fragrant blossoms gave promise of a fruitful harvest for the settlers . Willingly he endured the hardships of his wilderness life as he worked to make his dream come true . His sturdy young trees lightened the hearts and lifted the spirits of many settlers , for there is a suggestion of a permanent and loving home when one plants fruit trees around a cabin.He sold his trees for a few pennies each , accepting any of the coins current on the frontier . Some had no cash , and from those he accepted a simple promise to pay at a later date . Few failed to keep their word . He sometimes accepted payment in used clothing.As he was a small man , his bartered clothing usually fit him poorly . This led to some of the humorous descriptions of his appearance in those early years . Like many of the settlers , he went barefooted a great deal because shoes were hard to come by and seldom fit his tough gnarled feet . As he ate no meat , he carried a stewpot or kettle with him . In this he could gather nuts or berries in season , carry water , get milk from a settler 's cow , boil potatoes , or drop a handful of coarse-ground meal into the boiling water to make an unpalatable but nourishing meal . He has been pictured wearing such a pot on his head , but more likely he kept it tied to his pack rather than let it bounce on his head.He preferred to walk , carrying his precious apple seeds and the simplest of camping gear on his back . He also used a boat , canoe , or raft to transfer larger loads of seeds along the many waterways . Customarily , he obtained his apple seeds every fall . At first , he",0
"If the punishment for Homosexuality is they will be childless for 5 generations ? Where will the 2nd , 3rd , and 4th generation come from . As the gay-hating ( for lack of a better word ) in Christianity and most modern organized religion stemmed from base hatred of gay supporting cultures ( as in Rome , where homosexuality in men was considered more 'manly ' ) , such things were probably used to discourage people in an ancestor-based society .

"Does anyone have and want to share a routine to calculate fourier coefficient for even Mathieu 's Function Calc Classes of Solutions to Mathieu 's Equation Floquet 's theorem asserts that any solution to the Mathieu equation ( Eq . gif ) is of the form : [ 4,29,28 ] where is either real or imaginary and is a -periodic functiongif of . This assertion implies that solutions of Eq . gif can be separated into the product of a term of the form and a series of harmonics , , each of which is -periodic in . For values of with a non-zero imaginary component and , Eq . gif indicates that : Thus , , yields an unbounded solution to the Mathieu equation .

The special case of corresponds to an -periodic ( in terms of ) solution . These -periodic solutions are Mathieu functions of integral order.All bounded solutions to the Mathieu equation -- - those of fractional as well as integral order -- - are described ( in accordance with Floquet theory ) by an infinite series of harmonic oscillations whose amplitudes decrease with increasing frequency : The argument of in Eq . gif represents harmonics of frequency , while the term represents a ( secular ) frequency which is a function of the trap specifications ( or , equivalently , of the Mathieu parameters a , q ) .

"how are ionic solids formed ? Ionic solids are indeed formed by a gain and loss of electrons . More specifically , they are formed by a chemical reaction between a metal atom and a nonmetal atom . For example , sodium , a metal , has a tendency to want to lose an electron , and bromine , a nonmetal , wants to gain an electron , so the sodium gives an electron to bromin ( which is now called bromide ) . Now sodium has lost an electron , which is negatively charged , so it has a net charge of 1+ . Bromine has gained an electron , so it has a net charge of -1 . Since they are oppositely charged , they are attracted to each other ( kind of like how opposite poles of magnets are atracted to each other ) , they ionically bond and become an ionic solid ( also known as a salt ) .",0

"what is the order of the magnitude of the power of a light source so that the photons can knock me over ? To Skully : I often jump too quickly to answer a question , but it 's a bad habit . Solar sails and radiometers : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sailhttp : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes_radiometerIn fact , light is responsible for the motion of all electrons.As for the original question , I 'm going to assume that you 're a two meter long ( rather tall , actually ) 65 kilogram plank . Your center of gravity would have to be displaced about .25 meters ( off your feet ) to tip you over . Gravity exerts a maximum torque of about 80 N*m on you . At the top of your head , that torque produces 40 newtons . When it 's reflected , light exerts a `` pressure '' of 2*I/c where I is the intensity of light ( in watts per meter^2 ) . Multiplying both sides by area and plugging this into my calculator produces about 6 billion watts ( and remember , that 's if you wear a reflective surface on your head and it 's only enough to tip you over , not actually knock you down ) . I 'd say you 're pretty safe from sudden `` light gusts '' .",0

I 'm a former police officer and if you attacked her , I would arrest you . What you need to do is to talk to the girl 's parents . She sounds obsessive and that can be dangerous . You need to document every offense , possibly video tape her doing it or recording her with a hidden tape recorder , which , in Texas , you can legally do as long as one party in the conversation is aware that it 's being taped , i.e . you or your boyfriend talking to her . If she shows up at your home , call the police . If her parents refuse to put a stop to it , go to the school principal if you are all in the same school and if need be , the police but do not lay a hand on her unless she attacks you . Where do you think sympathy might lie in a court of law ? With you and your b/f who are older , or what they would consider a child misbehaving ? Right or wrong , sympathy will be on her side because of her age . You both have to be the mature ones in this case . Do n't try to solve it on your own . Do tell her when you speak to her that you are going to call the police or go to her parents and if that does n't work , do as I instructed . It 's the safesty way for anyone .

"Do You Belive th Entire Bible ? Do you belive in the entire bible , including Genisis ( not evolution ) , the New Testemant , and everything that God ( and Jesus ) says or commands ? Yes . But not the contorted , twisted , taken out of context versions that were edited to fit someones personal desires . Somethings in the bible dont quite sound right , but when you understand it and read the whole story of whats going on it all makes sense . Its like zooming out from just a few threads to see the big beautiful quilt . Its all interlinked and beautifully orchestrated . Its hard to see the whole thing when you focus just on a couple threads here and there.Faith is essential for belief.I find it neccessary to rebuke this blisschameleon , '' Evolution proves adam and eve wrong . '' Evolution is not proven . Also why are we not still evolving . The bible says God made each one according to its kind . `` And our knowledge of other solar stystems proves that there is n't just one sun in the entire universe . '' God has one Son , Jesus Christ . He made light and darkness . Please direct me to the scripture where you claim it says `` God made one sun , and one solar system . `` `` Humans traveling to space proves the tower of Babalon wrong . '' The destruction of Babylon was not over how far from the Earth the Babylonians were making themselves . It was about their attitude . Their wanting to build the tower to make themselves equal to God . Certainly this would not make it so , but it had nothing to do with a tower . `` Jesus ' story having similarities to osirus and Hercules.God condoning slavery , racism , sexism , violence ... revenge in some scriptures and disaproving them in other scriptures . '' God is the author of all things . My dear chameleon , you have failed to grasp the concept . God does not condone these things . He allows us to make decisions which results in our sin . You have failed to understand what is going on in the Bible . You are so far from the truth . Sexism ? ? ? ? ! ! ! Come on , did you even read the Bible ? Women are to be submissive to their husbands , yes . But there is even greater responsibility from the husbands to the wives .

"what does `` nobody can make you feel infrior without your permission '' mean ? what does `` nobody can make you feel inferior without your permission '' mean ? No one can MAKE you feel anything ( except physical pain of course ) . If you 're a professional dancer and some accountant who knows nothing about dance tells you you 're terrible , you 'll dismiss it because you do n't value his opinion . But if an accomplished dancer who you respect says the same thing it might make you actually question your talents , and feel inferior . In this case you would have given the dancer , but not the accountant , permission to make to make you feel inferior.But of course it might turn out that the dancer is old and bitter and wants to squash your potential by attacking your confidence . The key is to develop a solid sense of who you are - both your strengths and weaknesses . If someone attacks something you know is a strength , it should n't bother you . And if they attack something you know is a weakness - that really should n't bother you either because you 've accepted that this particular aspect is not your strongest .",0

"Best food for brain ? What can I eat to be more clever and remember more things ? Oh without question ... Try fish ... It makes a big difference ... you will fill it happen ... increased concentration and improved memory.This because fish contains Omega-3 fatty acids which is an 'essential fatty acid ' . An 'essential fatty acid ' is a type of fatty acid needed by our bodies which needs to be supplemented in our diets as we are incapable of producing it ourselves . Since most of us eat hugely insufficient amounts of such fatty acids , most of us are deficient in it . So adding it to our diets usually fulfils the immediate need for them and makes a big difference . Fatty fish are excellent sources of Omega-3 , but there is some concern about increased levels of heavy metal contaminants in their meat ... so i think it is best and more convenient to supplement your diet with processed fish oils ... which have been purified . Cod liver oil capsules are a popular and easily available fish oil supplement , however are very rich in Vitamin A . Perhaps the best choice left is to consider Fish Body Oil instead of fish liver oil ... if you can get your hands on those .

"how can a helicopter hover while the earth is turning ? The first answer is correct . I think for the second answer , the questioner would probably be wondering ... well , if the helicopter takes off with the same velocity as the earth , since the heli is now hovering and the earth keeps on turning , why does n't the earth spin past the helicopter ... And that is simply because the atmosphere is turning around with the heli , like the first answer stated.Just wanted to elaborate with another example . A fly takes off from the dashboard of a speeding car with its windows closed . Does the fly stay in air or , since the fly is now seperated from the car , does the car rush forward , making it seem like the fly is hurtled to the back of the car ? Even in this case , the air inside the car is being brought along with the car at the same speed . Therefore , the speed of the fly relative to the car will always be 0 .",0
"What 's a platypus ? It 's one of the few egg-laying mammals . It 's scientific name , Ornithorhynchus anatinus , means something like `` bird-beaked duck-like '' . Another good local name is `` duck-mole '' .In case you 've never seen one , try Google Image searchhttp : //images.google.com/images ? hl=en & lr= & rls=GGLC , GGLC:1969-53 , GGLC : en & q=ornithorhynchus % 20 & sa=N & tab=wiActually its `` beak '' is not hard as a bird 's , but covered with skin and extremely sensitive ( it can also sense low electric fields ) ; the animal uses it to explore the bottom of pools and small streams where it searches for food.Despite some `` reptilian '' features in their skeleton and anatomy , and the fact that their reproductive mode ( egg-laying ) is primitive for mammals , these animals are not `` primitive '' , they 're well adapted to their aquatic life : they have webbed feet , small eyes and almost no external ears , very thick fur and a flat tail that they use when swimming . Interestingly , platypuses are among the few venomous mammals : they have a `` spur '' in their hind feet associated with a venom gland that they use in fighting each other . Another interesting thing : adults do n't have teeth , they rely on ridged horny plates inside their mouth to crush the harder parts of the invertebrates that they feed on . However , juveniles do have functional molars with the same basic pattern as other mammals.They occur only in Australia at present , but fossil platypuses have been found in Patagonia , Argentina , so we know that their past distribution was wider.If you have the chance , watch the first episode of the David Attenborough 's series `` Life of mammals '' ; some of the best images of living monotremes I 've seen .",0

"What is the preferred treatment for a large hematoma on the shin caused by trauma ? The area on the shin is large ( 3 inches by 2 inches ) and very swollen and has n't changed for 3 months . Doctor says it may take 6 months to `` go down '' and that , if not , it may need to be `` drained '' . The doctors are right . I developed one on my shin after a wreck . 6 months later it was flat and only minorly discolored , 8 months later it was no longer painful to the touch and the coloration had gone , 10 months later it no longer hurt to run . It does take a while , I would wait as long as you can to decide to get it drained , because I was told this can be painful . But if there 's absolutely no change in color or size after 7 months , you may want to go for it , cause that 's about when the calcification process starts ( Eventually it will turn hard . ) Healing time also depends on where the hematoma is located . If there is mostly bone and not alot of muscle mass , it may not take as long ( i.e . top of foot , hand , etc . ) In areas with much muscle mass and fat , it may take a long time , because the muscle absorbs all the protein.Here 's what you can do to hurry it a little : Fill a styrofoam cup with water and freeze.Tear the top rim off so a half inch or so protrudes like chapstick.Massage the hematoma lightly with this ice for 15 minutes at a time , 3 to 4 times daily.At night , use some form of localized heat , that can be comfortable and not dangerous or painfull . This will help promote bloodflow in that area.DO N'T rub or massage the area , you may make the area bleed again under the skin , starting you back at day 1.Eat a diet rich in protein.Get extra rest if the hematoma is on your legs or feet.Good luck , I hope this helps you .",0

It keeps you from having deficiencies . Today however , it is often recommended that one consume 5-6 smaller meals .",0

"How does temperature affect the taste of food and drink ? For example , white wine , tap water , Cointreau , lager and even chocolate taste much better cold . On the other hand , tea , coffee and brandy , as well as most cooked meals , taste much better warm or hot . English beer and red wine are better at room or cellar temperature . Why ? Heat amplifies smell , and most of `` taste '' is actually based on smell . Without smell , coffee and chocolate would just be bitter anf gross . So aromatic things smell more strongly . Cold also delays the taste of things , so cold chocolate probably loses enough of the bitterness by being cold , while retaining enough aroma , such that that might make it better . Of course , if you like your chocolate bitter ( like I do ) you wo n't prefer it cold for taste reasons . I think cold chocolate -- especially dark chocolate -- is too tasteless.Occasionally there is a matter of texture as well . With chocolate , for instance , I 'd dispute that it tastes better cold , but it is certainly less melty . With beer/lager/ale , heat can make it go flat , which affects its taste , but with liquor , the intense burn of the alcohol makes the burn worse . Aromatic liquors like brandy/cognac and whiskey/scotch are heated to allow the aromas to be stronger , but really , most all alcohol is innately gross , and is an acquired taste -- so people tend to learn to like them in particular ways , but I do n't think any of it is particularly innate . Cognac , scotch , and fine wine all take years to `` learn '' to appreciate .",0

"how to seek a ideal job ? I would say the first thing to do is identify what you consider ideal and perhaps write it down . With those qualities in mind you can begin to think seriously about who you would want to work for , where you would want to work and what kind of work you would want to do . As you are thinking about that , take a look at your resume / cv . Does your knowledge , skills , experiences and education align you with your perfect job or do you need additional skills and training to help make you more marketable . If there are gaps , now is the time to address them.With that accomplished , you can set out with your list of qualities and your resume to find your perfect job . I suggest the best approach to this facet of your job search is to use a mixed approach . You can put your resume on the boards , but my experience has proven that it is n't the most effecient or effective way to find a job . Additionally , scour the job boards ( Monster.com , Hotjobs . com , Careerbuilder.com and any niche sites that you may know of or be a member of ) and identify jobs that you would want to apply for . Make sure that you are not kidding yourself or overestimating your abilities.While all of this is going on get the word out , talk to everyone you know and let them know that you are on the market and what kind of work you are looking for . Networking is one of the most effective ways to find a job.This is n't an exhaustive step-by-step guide , but it should help you get started . All of this advice comes from a number of years of experience as a recruiter for large corporations .",0

"is buffy the vampire slayer postmodern ? if so why ? In a word , yes . The longer version is that BtVS is a piece of postmodern art because : '' In terms of popular culture and mass media , there has been a large push towards the postmodern tendency of `` bricolage , pastiche and intertextuality '' ( Altman , 1999:141 ) in recent years . In regards to BtVS , the series creator , Joss Whedon , has stated when he was forming the character of Buffy he thought of `` the little girl , the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed , in every horror movie . The idea of Buffy was to subvert that idea , that image , and create someone who was a hero where she had always been a victim . That element of surprise , that element of genre busting is very much at the heart of the series '' ( 2001 ) . The notion of `` genre busting '' is found in the postmodern mixing of horror , comedy and drama , and results in the playful deconstruction of genre conventions , forcing the audience to question their assumed knowledge of the 'rules ' of a particular genre , such as the formal repetitive structure of horror films ( Dika , 1987:87 ) '' Therefore , the primary reason why the show can be considered postmodern is that , from its very inception , the show was intended to flip and subvert the horror movie standard of the blonde girl being slain by the monster in the dark alley . BtVS also goes on to subvert standard readings of text and narrative by becoming extra-textual or outside of the text , by making transgressive allusions and references . Buffy 's postmodernism comprises not only self-awareness but also awareness of other shows , movies , books and anything else , including referring to Martha Stewart as a demon.Postmodernism also often defines itself by what it is not . In the case of Buffy , the show ( and its creator ) often defines itself by setting itself apart from something else . Thus , for instance , in Buffy many episodes , scenes or lines start with a cliché and then move on from it to subvert that cliché or exaggerate it in unconventional ways for dramatic purposes . This is demonstrated most clearly when a character questions a commonly used saying . For instance , in the season 2 episode , 'Lie to Me ' , Willow wonders why people say 'sticks out like a sore thumb ' : Xander : In no way do we stick out like sore thumbs . Willow : Okay , but do they really stick out ? Xander : What ? Willow : Sore thumbs . Do they stick out ? I mean , have you ever seen a thumb and gone , 'Wow ! That baby is sore ! ' Xander : You have too many thoughts.Another example is the show 's original conceit : the cliche that high school can be hell is given a postmodern twist by creating a show in which high school was literally on the mouth of hell .",0

"Earth is a phenomena and a woman too is a phenomena .Man is part of this phenomena . Why GOD is called HE ? read Concept of God has emerged in the mankind after being born and based on the behaviour pattern of human beings alone.Religions have unable to convey the essence and existance of GOD which could unite every human being without doubts.Religions have created more doubts . However many followers , which kept dividing in numbers , according to technical interpretations , and , became politicl force.Reality of the ABSOLUTE got lost.Earth lost importance , motherhood too lost significance.What is reality ? A spermis a phenomena but is part of of a phenomena called Ovum.Mensurations periods of a woman are like monsoon periods on Earth which prepares itself for creating life all arround .Woman sheds her blood and earth the essence of blood , water.In stead of calling let us save this Earth , let Us say O ! mother Earth accept us with LOVE in YOUR WOMB .The GOD inside this phenomena will listen to your prayers .God is experienced in every mode of nature and not outside it as propagated by religion God is commonly referred to in the masculine sense because of the relationship that primarily judaism based religions wished to portray between god and mankind . God the Father , because at the time all the ancient religious texts for these religions were written a family was dominated by the father and rather than using the metaphor of the mother , which would imply at the time that there was some other superior to the God figure , they used a masculine term . This term has persisted due to a continuation of male dominance in society and through the institution of tradition which is now so ancient that many believe it would be heresy to alter it today . It is true that the relationship that many today share with god is much better described as female , but this too stems from the feminization of 'soft ' concepts such as love and procreation . Consequently calling God male or female is 100 % related to culture and I would like to answer your question with a question . Why try to personify god as male or female ? If you follow western society 's modern beleif that male and female are equal , or the more radical belief that there is no definite male or female but shades of gender ( see transgender ) , and if gender serves the sole function of procreation through sexual intercourse why attempt to place the all powerful being that is God within the restraints of a single gender . God does not need to procreate through sexuality as God is capable of creation without thought or effort . So , why call God she ? Why not just understand that God is God regardless of name or gender .",0

"What is a PIC ( ? ) tube or insert ? My brother starts Chemo & radiation next week and they set up his feeding tube for when he needs it down the line . PIC stands for percutaneous intravenous catheter . Sometimes it is necessary to receive medicine or other fluids intravenously ( in the vein ) . If it is needed for a long period of time , the doctor might consider a PIC line as the best option . PIC lines are long , flexible tubes inserted into a large vein , usually near the elbow . The tube ( medically speaking , all tubes are called catheters ) is threaded up the vein until its tip reaches the large veins inside the chest.A PIC line can remain in place for several weeks or more . They are especially helpful for patients who need to receive medication at home for a long time . It is not uncomfortable . Most people have no trouble with them , and they can remain quite active while having one in place . PIC lines have bandages which are placed over the insertion site to make sure it does n't get accidentally tugged . This bandage has to be changed every day or two . A PIC line can be used for several kinds of injections , therefore , the patient does not have to be poked so many times .",0
"Is college worth the effort ? It 's definitely worth the effort , but it 's not totally necessary . Obtaining a Bachelor 's or Master 's will instantly make you a better candidate for higher-paying jobs , but it 's not the only way into a good career and lifestyle . If you are not motivated enough , disciplined enough and academically inclined enough , then college will be hell for you . For those millionares who either dropped out or never attended college , they had great ideas , motivation , access to money and resources , and great contacts .

"hi , my stomach is growing day by day i want it to reduce in 1 week plz help me i m20 yrs old thax bye ? I 'm guessing on this one . If you do n't have a health problem causing this , you should reflect on what is different . Meaning what are you doing and not doing now . A lot of young adults gain weight just from the freedom of being able to eat what they want when they want . Also maybe you are not active enough . Try just eating a less , but healthy . Adding very small treats , to make it easy to stick to . Then incorporate excersize . Start small so you wo n't hate it . Soon you will be able to gradually have a good workout . Do n't plan on loosing it in one week unless you would like a heart attack . If you do n't beleive me , do some research or ask your doctor . Today this doe n't sound so hot , but these changes should make you happy .",0
"Receiving child support from someone on public assistance ? My husband has custody of his daughter and his daughter 's mother ( who does not see her anymore -- it 's been almost 10 months now ) is on public assistance and disability ( because of having bi-polar disorder , I guess ) . He wants to file for support because when HE did not have custody he paid his support faithfully . And he feels she needs to support her kid too . But he is curious if he will GET any support . I was told they would just subtract the support amount from the assistance amount and send the custodial parent the difference . But it would be nice to see if anyone else has had this experience before he files and takes time off work to do it . As long as there is not a medical condition preventing her from working she will be required to pay child support . The child support can be deducted out of her pay check . The amount of her assistance wo n't change . Even if she is on assistance the law requires that she supports her daughter the same way that her dad did .",0

"Is there a free chemical test for Brass and/or Gold ? If you want to identify brass versus gold , try using some ammonia solution or vinegar on the metal . Brass has oxides which will be dissolved and the brass will come out much brighter . Gold does not oxidize and will not react . Highly polished brass will not have an oxide coat to remove , so you can test it by immersing it in a solution with 2/3 vinegar and 1/3 hydrogen peroxide solution , and leave it for more than fifteen minutes . If it is brass and not gold , the solution will begin to turn green as the copper in the brass begins to dissolve . Again , gold will not react .",0

"Why does n't any one care about Africa ? First of all , I do n't think that 's a fair assessment . There are plenty of people who do in fact care very much about Africa and its people . UNICEF , Doctors Without Borders , CARE , and just about every AIDS group you can think of is involved over in Africa quite a lot.If you mean `` Why is n't Africa a higher priority for most of the world 's goverments ? '' then I think you are hitting nearer the mark . I 'm no expert on Africa , but I think there 's a couple of reasons why it does n't peg a bit higher on the attention-o-meter insofar as the US is concerned . Hitherto , Africa has n't had a whole lot to offer us . Sounds harsh , I know , but it 's the truth . We are forced to deal with the Middle East because they are a big energy source , but if the oil was n't there we would n't be either . African oil is starting to become a market player now too , so some of our attention may be shifting towards that region.The other main reason is the perception that Africa is a continent filled with people who simply can not get their collective sh*t together . It 's brimming with petty dictatorships , bloody coups , transient goverments , unending civil wars and ethnic violence . In the international arena there just is n't anyone reliable to deal with on a nation-to-nation level . Our news stories have left me at least with the view that Africa is a limitless sinkhole into which all the world 's largesse could be poured without doing much more than fattening up a corrupt few at the top and financing more armies to fight in the wars and/or commit the heinous genocides we read about all too often.Do the African people suffer ? Of course they do ! Most of those organizations I listed at the top are all about addressing the suffering on the individual 's level . But until Africa starts to produce more responsible goverments , not too much will ever be done geopolitically to help them .",0

Clearly there are some national security reasons to make some things difficult to locate . Yes , it is certainly true that national security is sometimes used where it shouldn ’ t be use . However the recourse for such actions is public access to records and application can be made for anything . If the government wants to keep it for only a high security clearance , then it must demonstrate that necessity in a court.Banning of books generally occurs at the local level in the local school or library .

"Problems with a relationship ? I 'm in my mid twenty 's and dating a guy twenty years older than me and he had said he really cared for me and then all the sudden he said it was n't working . But the next day he 's ready to try again and start all over . What would you do about that . The answer by vanessitacool is right on the money . This is a straight forward situation where you really need to walk away . But based on the background in your question , I sense that you may have a little trouble understanding why . So I will offer a little bit more.Consider that you may be only hearing what you want to hear . The fact that he said that he 'cared for you ' and that 'it was n't working ' . Sound contradictory when taken as sentence fragments , but in reality they are part of a much bigger communication context . I suspect that if you did n't just listen for what you want to hear , the message would sound alot more clear cut.Also when he says that he is ready to try again and start over , that may just be driven by some alterior motive ( sex ) . Men will say/do almost anything for that , and given that he is much older it is very conceivable that he is well versed in maniuplating younger more impressionable and vulnerable women.Do n't be a victim of these games . You deserve better .",0

"Why does society feel that they have the right to impose their opinion on others ? When an issue is one where there will be no viable consequence to society but is of a completly personal nature . ie abortion , religion , etc ... Why do people feel they have the right to force others to live the way they 've chosen instead of leaving these issues up to the person who will be affected by their choice . Abortion and religious decisions should absolutely be made only by yourself only . You are absolutely right how people try to impose their beliefs onto others .

If it 's the sex , then you will get bored and horny . If it is the looks then you will get bored and want to see that person . But , if it is love , then you miss seeing that person , and maybe even the sex , but you will not get bored because just hearing the person 's voice will make your heart skip a beat .

"how does one learn to swim well ? I can manage to go swim about 20 mtrs but i am exhausted and cant go any further . Can someone point me to good online swimming lessons and techniques for amateurs . If you are trying to swim freestyle ( crawl ) , switch to an easier stroke , like the sidestroke while you increase your endurance . If you can only swim 20m , then swim 20m , rest , and swim 20m again . Repeat that process . You can time your rests and shorten your rests as you get stronger and increase the number of repititions you do each session . After a while , push yourself to do 40m between stops , then 60 , etc.In my experience , if you can work up to 400m without stopping , you will be past the point where you are struggling in the water.It might be a good idea to have someone look at your stroke and tell you what needs correcting . If you are struggling to make 20m . there are probably a lot of things that you can do to make your stroke more efficient . Find out what they are and work on correcting one thing at a time . Find someone who 's swimming laps when you are at pool , someone who 's stroke looks good , and ask them to look at your stroke . Ask them what the worst thing that you are doing and what they think you should do about it . You 'd be suprised how many people would be happy to help you .",0
"Why oil , ghee , butter and fried food is restricted for a daibatic , while they do not contain sugar ? Because everything you eat turns into glucose . Sugar turns to glucose the easiest so it goes into your blood stream fastest . Fats turn into glucose a bit slower , so you need to limit them to keep your blood from being filled with glucose . Protiens and complex carbohydrates turn to glucose slowest . So , eat lots of green veggies , beans , whole grains and lean meats and strictly limit or just do n't eat white flour , white rice , potatos , sugar , honey , corn syrup etc.If America were to eat like they have diabetes , this country would n't have as many over weight people who just might become diabetic !

What we have to watch is loosing the moral high ground and becoming the same as the enemy we fight .",0
"Has anyone dug up any fossils in their yard ? Yes , I live in a suburban area close to the coast in Buenos Aires , Argentina . Some years ago , excavations were made in order to install sewers ( believe it or not , we were not connected to the public sewer system then ! ) and the workers dug up large fragments of fossil whales . I only have a fragment that could be part of a humerus , but more complete whale skeletons often appear when people around here construct large swimming pools . These bones are not of much paleontological interest , though . They 're much too `` new '' and do not correspond to any uncommon or interesting species .",0
"Will we ever evolve to Homo sapiens futuria as it has been predicted ? Is nature that predictable I would have to disagree with David to some extent . To evolve into a different species we would have changed enough so that different subpopulations of humans could no longer interbreed . Humans display a range of social and technological aptitudes and capacities throughout earth , the majority of which have n't even heard a dialtone let alone participated in any form of advanced travel or communications processes . However , none of these people are incabable of doing so if provided with the appropriate education needed . This suggest that there has n't been any change in our molecular ( genetic ) makeup that provides us with these advanced technologies -- which is where the changes are needed to happen for biological evolution to occur . Even if you wanted to argue that social evolution has distinguished industrialized man from our primitive brethern enough to warrant a new species distinction , I would argue that we still have n't met one of the key requirements for doing so , there are no subgroups of humans on earth that are incapable of interbreeding with one another . Until that happens , no we have n't evolved from Homo sapiens sapiens to Homo sapiens futura . However , we will evolve into someting different ! This is a certainty -- as long as our species does n't become extint before that can happen ! But do n't expect that Homo sapiens will evolve into just one different species . Depending on what our environment ( s ) dictates , humans could evolve into numerous other species . Through the process of evolution , it is inevitable , but at the same time it is not predictable .",0

"Why is the ocean blue ? It might sound like i 'm joking.. But i really need to know . Is it because it 's reflecting off the sky ? Water is faint blue . Although water appears clear in small quanities ( like a glass of water ) , the blue color becomes visible the more water we look through . Thus , deep lakes and seas are bluer than a shallow river.Other factors can affect the color we see : 1 . Particles and solutes can absorb light , as in tea or coffee . Green algae in rivers and streams often lend a blue-green color . The red sea has occasional blooms of red Trichodesmium erythraeum algae . 2 . Particles in water can scatter light . The Colorado river is often muddy red because of suspended reddish silt in the water . Some mountain lakes and streams with finely gound rock , such as glacial flour , are tourquise . Light scattering by suspended matter is required in order that the blue light produced by water 's absorption can return to the surface and be observed . Such scattering can also shift the spectrum of the emerging photons toward the green , a color often seen when water laden with suspended particles is observed . 3 . The surface of seas and lakes often reflect blue skylight , making them appear bluer . [ [ [ Montana reflection . ] ] ] The relative contribution of reflected skylight and the light scattered back from the depths is strongly dependent on observation angle .",0

"How come you never see dead pigeons ? From straightdope : '' You do n't see many dead city pigeons for a couple of reasons . The first is that scavengers make pretty quick work of them . Insects alone can reduce a deceased pigeon to a heap of feathers and bones in a week or two . Rats , dogs , or other animals may drag the carcass off into some secret corner for a late snack . City sanitation crews occasionally stir themselves to scoop up a couple.The other reason you do n't see dead pigeons is that old and feeble ones usually hole up in some out-of-the-way place so they wo n't be seen by predators . Nooks and crannies in and around buildings are always popular , but I 'd say the pigeons ' favorite spot is the ironwork underneath viaducts . I recently inspected one near the office of the newspaper that publishes my column . I found the surrounding area littered with decaying remains . Mostly these were former editors sleeping it off . However , there were a bunch of dead pigeons , too . Naturally , I paused for a moment of respectful silence . For the pigeons . I mean , pigeons and editors both do the icky on the stuff you cherish most . But at least the pigeons do n't think , `` Wow , now it sings . '' ''",0

"What author coined the phrase user-centered design ?

"Am I going crazy , should I back to the ER ? I started getting really upset today-screaming , crying , anger , sadness ect . It lasted a while . I have been physically sick for 2 months . The EMS were called as well as the police . I was taken to the ER and they did n't really do anything for me . I waited 5 hours because my various doctors were calling each other and stuff . I am at home really kinda freakin out . I am scared to death , anxitiy off the charts ! Does anyone know what is wrong ? I would guess anxiety/panic attack . I was physically ill also for quite some time before my last attack . The E.R . does n't deal with mental health issues very well ; they 're always looking for a physical cause . I 'd suggest while you 're waiting , seek the advise of a councelor who deals with mental health in your area .

"What is Islam and why is Islam ? What is Islam ? Islam is not a new religion , but the same truth that God revealed through all His prophets to every people . For a fifth of the world 's population , Islam is both a religion and a complete way of life . Muslims follow a religion of peace , mercy , and forgiveness , and the majority have nothing to do with the extremely grave events which have come to be associated with their faith.Who are the Muslims ? One billion people from a vast range of races , nationalities and cultures across the globe - from the southern Philippines to Nigeria - are united by their common Islamic faith . About 18 % live in the Arab world ; the world 's largest Muslim community is in Indonesia ; substantial parts of Asia and most of Africa are Muslim , while significant minorities are to be found in the Soviet Union , China , North and South America , and Europe.What do Muslims believe ? Muslims believe in One , Unique , Incomparable God ; in the Angels created by Him ; in the prophets through whom His revelations were brought to mankind ; in the Day of Judgement and individual accountability for actions ; in God 's complete authority over human destiny and in life after death . Muslims believe in a chain of prophets starting with Adam and including Noah , Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob , Joseph , Job , Moses , Aaron , David , Solomon , Elias , Jonah , John the Baptist , and Jesus , peace be upon them . But God 's final message to man , a reconfirmation of the eternal message and a summing-up of all that has gone before was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through Gabriel.What does 'Islam ' mean ? The Arabic word 'Islam ' simply means 'submission ' , and derives from a word meaning 'peace ' . In a religious context it means complete submission to the will of God . 'Mohammedanism ' is thus a misnomer because it suggests that Muslims worship Muhammad rather than God . 'Allah ' is the Arabic name for God , which is used by Arab Muslims and Christians alike .",0

"how did the `` southern accent '' or drawl come to be ? I 've included a link to a good article on this topic - good reading . Here 's an excerpt that discusses the origins : -- -The general southern dialect has its origins in the English immigrants who moved to the South in the 17th and 18th centuries , of whom most were of European Celtic origins ( according to an 1860 census , `` three-quarters of white Southerners had surnames that were Scottish , Irish or Welsh in origin . '' [ 1 ] ) . These immigrants brought with them a very distinct style of English speaking , which was then combined with the African languages spoken by the African Americans who were at this time enslaved in the South . Over time this cultural and linguistic diversity combined with the South 's rural isolation , and longtime use and familiarity with the King James Version of the Bible in religious life , to produce a unique American dialect .",0

"Who can tell me about Frances Farmer ? she 's was from seattle i think Frances Elena Farmer ( September 19 , 1913 , Seattle , Washington – August 1 , 1970 , Indianapolis , Indiana ) was an American film actress.Early life , career and marriageFarmer was born and raised in Seattle , Washington . In 1931 , at age 17 , she entered and won $ 100 in a writing contest sponsored by Scholastic Magazine with her controversial essay God Dies . In 1935 , as a student at the University of Washington , she won a subscription contest for the leftist newspaper The Voice of Action . First prize was a trip to the Soviet Union , which she took despite her mother 's strong objections . These two incidents led to accusations that Farmer was both an atheist and a Communist . Farmer studied drama at the University of Washington . During the 1930s its drama department productions were considered citywide cultural events and attended accordingly . While there she starred in diverse plays including Helen of Troy , Everyman and Uncle Vanya . In 1935 she starred in the school 's production of Alien Corn , speaking foreign languages , playing the piano and receiving rave reviews in what was the longest running play in the department 's history at the time.1936Returning from the Soviet Union in the summer of 1935 Farmer stopped in New York City , hoping to launch a legitimate theater career . Instead , she was referred to Paramount talent scout Oscar Serlin who arranged for a screen test . Paramount offered her a 7-year contract . Farmer signed it in New York on her 22nd birthday ( September 19 , 1935 ) and moved to Hollywood . She had top billing in two well-received 1936 `` B '' films and that same year was cast opposite Bing Crosby in Rhythm On The Range . Also in 1936 she was loaned to Samuel Goldwyn to appear in Come and Get It , based on the novel by Edna Ferber . Her portrayals of both the mother and daughter were praised by the public and critics , some of whom wrote of her potential to become a major star . She also married her first husband , actor Leif Erickson , in 1936.A rebellious starFarmer was not entirely satisfied with her career , however . She felt stifled by Paramount 's tendency to cast her in films which depended on her looks more than her talent and her naturally outspoken demeanor made her seem uncooperative and contemptuous . In an age when the studios dictated every facet of a star 's life , Farmer rebelled against the studio 's control and although she allowed herself to be put through cosmetic `` makeovers '' and photographed in bathing suits for publicity purposes , she resisted every attempt they made to glamourize her private life , refusing to attend Hollywood parties or to date other stars for the gossip columns . At the time , she was sympathetically described as being indifferent about the clothing she wore and was said to drive an older-model `` green roadster , '' which according to a columnist , once broke down on Melrose Avenue , blocking traffic as Farmer pushed the stricken car to the side , much to the consternation of the studio 's publicity department.Hoping to enhance her reputation as a serious actress , she left Hollywood in 1937 to do summer stock on the East Coast . She had already attracted the attention of Harold Clurman and Clifford Odets and appeared in the Group Theatre production of Odets ' play Golden Boy in a performance which at first received highly mixed reviews ( Time magazine commented that she had been miscast ) . However by 1938 when the production had embarked on a national tour , regional critics from Washington D.C. to Chicago had given her rave reviews.Farmer also had an affair with Odets but he was married to actress Luise Rainer and did n't offer Farmer a commitment . Farmer felt betrayed when Odets suddenly ended the relationship , believing he had used her drawing power to further the success of his play .

"Is it true you only have six months to go after an employer for wrongful discharge ? As usual with legal-related questions on Yahoo ! Answers , far too little information exists to answer the question adequately . The length of time varies for the forum , and for the type of wrongful discharge .

"what impcat of personal computers does it have on correspondence ? Personal computers introduced a more efficient form of asynchronous communication . Synchronous communication is when both parties are talking , communicating at the same time . This is like a chat room , or a telephone conversation . The difficulty that this can cause arises with the different time zones , schedule conflicts , etc.Asychronous communication is when both parties need not be present , thereby eliminating the difficulty of time zones and other scheduling difficulties . Prior to personal computers being used for correspondence , mail was used . Because of the delays between writing a message , a letter , and the recipient getting the letter , this was not very efficient . The telegraph sped up the process a bit , but could be expensive , and did not allow for long and detailed messages . Fax machines helped speed up the process , but , for a long time , you needed specialized and expensive equipment . E-mail introduced a very fast , and inexpensive , means of asynchronous communication , and because personal computers are becoming more and more common , more people are able to use the process .",0

"would ypu prefer win 98 or XP ? It depends on 2 things : what kind of hardware you have and what sort of things you do with your computer.HARDWARE : It is safe to say that most PCs sold today can carry the weight of WinXP , plus the load of MS Office XP/2003 and browsing Internet . But if you are still using a 5 or more year-old PC with 128MB or less RAM , you are better off using Win98 . Another issue you might need to know is that whether the PC comes with any USB socket ( which is very common nowadays but not before 2000 , not in developing countries anyway ) and whether you want to use it if it does have one . WinXP makes it easier to use USB devices , whereas Win98 does not comes with any USB driver . ( A 3rd-party native USB driver for win98 can be found at http : //rapidshare.de/files/1217842/nusb22e.exe.html ) WHAT YOU DO : First off , if you are to play any current PC games , go for WinXP . If you are to do any kind of graphics intensive applications like any of the Adobe family software , video editing and encoding , CAD/CAM system , etc. , all of which require a lot of memory size , go for WinXP ( since it can address a higher RAM size ) . If you need an EASY ( without installing any 3rd-party driver ) way to transfer files from and to USB devices ( like flash drives , digital cameras , mobile MP3 players , mobile harddisks , etc . ) go for WinXP . If you only need it for typing some documents/letters , browsing the web , and listening to audio CDs , you can stick with Win98 . If you have some legacy software written to run on Win98 only ( such as customised accounting package ) , stick to Win98.Of course there are many other more specific issues can be considered , but the above can serve as a basic guideline . I hope this help .",0

"Global warming ? Should we take steps to prevent global warming or should we just ride it out ? Several things : First , the data is flawed . Most temperature measurements are taken in cities where you have an increase of what is called a heat island that is growing . More asphalt and concret to store heat . Second the temp and CO2 levels are rising but so what . The CO2 levels have been 10 times higher than they currently are and the planet has been much hotter in the past and its done well enough for us to still be here . And all of that is without the help of humans.Third we are comming out of an ice age . Ice age=cold , no ice age=hot . Fourth the suns output of energy has risen in the past century , more energy into our system = more heat.Reasons why more CO2 is not a bad thing . Plants use CO2 for photosynthesis , more CO2 = more photosynthesis = more plants . The earth is in a greenification process right now that is turning alot of grasslands into areas that have shrubs and areas with shrubs are growing trees .

"Is it ever okay to get a divorce in the eyes of God ? What if you married an aethiest or an agnostic ? What if your husband beats you to a pulp continuously ... and there are kids involved ? What if your husband is cheating on you ... and wo n't stop ? Are you just supposed to stick it out because of the vows you took ? ( This really is n't a personal experience question so I do n't need advice on how to go to a woman 's shelter or anything ) . Although I am answering from a Catholic perspective , the theology is fairly universal.Jesus forbade divorce , except in cases of adultery . However , a divorce also implies that there was a marriage . This tends to be the angle that the Catholic church approaches the breakdown of a legal marriage , and that is , `` was it even a marriage ? `` Marriage is , as Jesus puts it , `` when two become one flesh '' , people whom God himself has `` joined together . '' A sacramental moment of that magnitude requires that people enter it with full consent , and that consent requires both the personal maturity to give that consent as well as having all the information needed to make that consent . Take abuse , for instance - abuse implies a kind of marital fraud . Nobody would knowingly start dating someone who they knew was going to beat them , right ? An abusive person is always going to put their best foot forward at first and hide that aspect of themselves until a time when they feel safe to let it out . This is a fraud - and if a person marries such a person , they are n't doing it with that full consent of the will necessary for a marriage to truly exist.So a civil divorce may not always be a wrong thing to do , if it really is more of an annulment of a marriage that never truly was.Also - the other thing to keep in mind , is that what Jesus specifically condemned was divorce and remarriage , not divorce alone . So even if the marriage was valid in the eyes of God - i.e . abuse , lies , fraud , alcoholism were n't part of the breakdown , it was a valid marriage - it is only remarriage that he 's actually condemned.An aside : marriage was not created by the state . It long predates the state . Marriage was deeded to the state by religion ...",0

"Who decides what is politically correct ? Support your answer please . Politically correct is a term that I think refers to respect for minorities . It 's basically a way of speaking that attempts to respect others by adopting the same language they use when referring to themselves , or the issues that are of most importance to them . It is a reflection of our national values of equality and equal rights.Because of the nature of opression , majority groups such as Men , Christians and Whites are usually much less affected by slurs , racism , etc , because they are not living with the legacy of discrimination and opression in the recent past.To answer the question , I would say that the minorities themselves would be the ones who decide what is and is not disrespectful , racist , or politically correct from their perspective.For example , many black people prefer to be called `` African Americans '' rather than black or negro or other such words . Some of those worlds have been used throughout our history and are strongly connected with opression and discrimination . Knowing this , we can choose to respect those wishes and adopt that speech , or we can reject it outright.Asian-Americans may feel that being called `` oriental '' is offensive to them , as the word has it has taken on a negative historical connotation , in books and spoken words throuought the years.Women might find it offensive to be called `` the little lady '' or `` girls '' , as this may harken back to a time when people thought of women as inferior to men or needing of male guidance , so they prefer to be called women.Basically I think that political correctness is a choice that you make to respect or disrespect minorities when you are discussing issues of race or gender in public .",0

"What are the basic differences that separate Roman Catholicism and Protestantism ? I think a major difference is that Protestants believe that you can not get to heaven on your own merit , that you must confess your sins and trust in Jesus as God 's son who died as a sacrifice for your sins ; they believe that you can not avoid sin on your own , that you must rely on Jesus as a redeemer , but that you will want to do good works out of appreciation for God 's salvation through Jesus . I think that Roman Catholics believe that you must acknowledge that Jesus is God 's son , but also that you have to do good works to get to heaven.From what I understand , Protestants believe that you can/should directly ask Jesus to forgive your sins , while Roman Catholics believe that you can/should confess your sins to a priest , who will in turn be your `` intercessor '' to Jesus/God . Also , Protestants believe that only Jesus/God/Holy Spirit are holy and that the Virgin Mary ( Jesus ' mother ) or other `` saints '' are just regular people , saved by God 's grace/Jesus . Roman Catholics believe that the Virgin Mary and other `` saints '' are holy , and can be prayed to for miracles or forgiveness.For the most part , I think that Protestants believe that when you die , you will go to heaven or hell . Roman Catholics believe that you might go to purgatory ( where you are `` purged '' of your sins before you get into heaven ) . I think there 's also `` Limbo , '' which is a place where babies can go if they have n't been able to comprehend the choice between heaven and hell.There are , of course , a lot of different divisions within Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths , so a lot of these are generalizations , and will not necessarily apply to a Protesant or Roman Catholic person 's personal beliefs .",0

"How people judge people ? do you judge people by looks , personality , way-of thinking ... Initially , people judge people by appearance and actions , because these are the first things that you can observe about someone . You can judge this up close or from a distance . People usually judge based on comparing another person to their own appearance , and how much the appearance differs from their own appearance.If someone takes the time to get to know someone , they will judge a person on `` deeper '' issues : intelligence , ways of spending time , ways of treating others , and beliefs . Of course , these again are perceived by the person that is doing the judging , and they 're usually compared to their own characteristics/beliefs.Should people judge people ? Yes , and no . It 's good to have standards that you expect of people , in terms of how you are treated , and standards of common decency . However , one should keep in mind that this world would be a boring place if we were all the same , and that everyone does not have the same experiences that you have . So , although judging is hard to avoid , you have to control what you do with your judgements . And it 's always good to reassess what you think of someone . Try to get to know people better .",0

"how do I get over being hungover ? I feel really sick after the night I drink and it goes on around a day long . Is it my stomach or what ? I 'd appreciate your help about that . And Dehydration is what causes a hang over . Alcohol sucks the nutrients out of your body and gives you no real nutritional value . I would suggest before going to bed to drink Gatorade or some other electrolyte drink ( Powerade , Altima , Energy Water ) . This will slowly start to replenish you , though if you drank a lot , you 'll need more.Be sure to drink a lot of water throughout the day and eat some bread ( which will absorb some of the alcohol ) . Nutritious food through out the day will also help.If you feel really , really sick the night before , you could always throw up , drink some gatorade , sleep a lot , you 're more likely to wake up refreashed .",0

"Pro-lifers , answer me this ... ? Without getting all passionate and calling out God 's name , can you explain in calm tones and with facts , why pro-lifers think that they have the right to demand that other women follow their beliefs and not have abortions ? Consider this:1 . If you believe that abortion is morally wrong , and someone else disagrees , why is it okay for you to insist that they share your views ? After all , Hindus think its wrong to eat cows , and i 've met pro-lifers who enjoy burgers . Isnt a difference in morals normal ? 2 . if you are so against abortion , would you adopt a woman 's child if she cancelled her procedure ? would you adopt EVERY SINGLE CHILD that would otherwise be aborted ? and if not , does n't that make you a hypocrite ? 3 . Many pro-choicers are n't pro-abortion and would not have one themselves . They believe in the right of a woman to have a choice . What do you base your right to force your ideals onto others on ? ( and please , do n't say religion . What if the woman is an atheist ? ) I am not a pro-lifer but the way I see it - which could be wrong - without repeating what others said is that you can not kill a soul.I believe in reincarnation . OK ... .once born : different question and a dilemna.But on the whole : is an unwanted child better ? I do n't think so at all . What if people were forced to adopt a child they did not want ? Life for everyone would be very miserable.And to those out there : sometimes girls need to hide the fact from the family so putting up for adoption is out of question . The family would resent it a lot and force the girl to have and keep the child.Children should be wanted and loved . If that is not the case , better have an abortion rather than raise an unfit , miserable human being .",0

"Im keeping a food diary to control my food intake , as I have to drop about 30 pounds . Does it really work ? Experts say writing down your eating habits will keep your diet on track -- even when you slip up and eat a few things you wish you hadn't.Food journals can help keep portions under control . For example , do n't just write that you ate chicken for dinner . Write down how many ounces that piece of chicken was . And how many pieces you consumed . Information on gauging portions can be found on the Internet . If you are not seeing a dietician , you can cross-check your daily food intake with the USFDA food guide pyramid . The Food and Nutrition Information Center Web site provides a USFDA food guide pyramid at www.nalusda.gov/fnic/index.html . The Web site includes USFDA food pyramids for ethnic foods as well.Wondering if you 've eat enough servings of fruit and vegetables ? A food journal can help you figure it out . While it 's not helpful to everyone , many people report food journal success.No matter what you 're weight loss or eating goal , scribbling your snacking habits down is a good idea , experts say .

"a canadien hockey player in 1985 ? a canadien hockey player in 1985 On February 22 , 2002 , Wayne Gretzky made history as the architect of Canada 's first gold medal in Olympic men 's hockey in 50 years . It proved that three years after retirement , `` The Great One 's '' contribution to the game and country he loves is not over.Gretzky was only ten years old when his talent as the defenceman-winger-centre for the Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers caught the attention of Toronto Telegram sportswriter John Iaboni . His story about the prolific 369-goal scorer turned out to be a glimpse of what was in store for the greatest hockey player to lace up a pair of skates . Gretzky was born on January 26 , 1961 . By age two his father and `` greatest coach , '' Walter already had his son on skates . By the time he joined the Nadrofsky Steelers , he already had a reputation of carving out scoring opportunities against players twice his age and taller than his modest height.At 15 , he joined the Ontario Hockey Association , turning professional two years later as an underage junior with the Indianapolis Racers in the now defunct World Hockey Association ( WHA ) . He only played eight games for the Racers ( chalking up three goals and three assists ) before being traded to the WHA 's Edmonton Oilers where he was named WHA Rookie of the Year.In 1979 , the Edmonton Oilers entered the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . Gretzky remained in Edmonton nine seasons , leading the Oilers to four Stanley Cups , and helping to build hockey 's strongest franchise of the 1980s.Not surprisingly , Gretzky 's trade to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988 made front-page news and topped all national newscasts . Gretzky was the ambassador of hockey ; the struggling Kings needed to fill seats , and the NHL wanted to promote its game in the United States.Since joining the NHL , Gretzky has had more impact on the record book than any other player . By the time he retired , The Great One held over 60 NHL records and most of the sport 's prestigious hardware , including nine Hart Trophies for most valuable player and five Lester B. Pearson Trophies for MVP as voted by other players.His most cherished record , however , came on October 25 , 1989 , when he scored two goals and an assist to surpass the all-time points record set by his hero , Gordie Howe.Wayne Gretzky retired from professional hockey as a New York Ranger on April 18 , 1999 . In addition to the NHL , and his considerable charity work , he has made Canadians proud on the world stage - particularly as Executive Director of Team Canada for the 2002 Winter Olympics . Additionally , Gretzky is part owner of the Phoenix Coyotes.Canada 's Walk of Fame Trivia : Wayne Gretzky 's first jersey was No . 9 after his hockey hero , Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings .",0

"why are people so ignorant about the Pagan based religions or witchcraft ? Well , you are certain to get a bunch of Christians jumping on this one , which may be an answer in itself . Much ignorance is due to having a different point of view ( usually christian , but perhaps other `` standard '' religions as well ) that prevents you from seeking real facts.Secondly , the pagan mysteries have long protected themselves , hiding behind symbols , misdirection and so on , because of persecution .

"what is inertia of success ? hari is right and wrong . inertia of success is the the achievments which come along with the achievement of a prelimnary success/target . The achievment of this success lays foundation of future successes . But this is not true in all cases.There have been cases where companies taken by the inertia of success , have failed in delivering success in future because of their complacent attitude ( read : over confidence ) because of past success.Most companies today face the obstacle of overcoming the inertia of success , and achieve succees not thru inertia but thru proper force/effort.http : //in.rediff.com/money/2004/aug/12guest1.htmhttp : //www.kk.org/newrules/newrules-6.html",0

"who will allocate memory for Objects in Java ? Will the memory be allocated before compilation ? That depends on how you run your Java programs . Since you say `` compilation '' , I assume you 're actually building them into executable form.Memory is allocated in real-time , that is , when an object is instantiated , that is when the memory is allocated by the system . Say you have an object that is created only after you enter your name . When the program starts , the object is not in memory . Once you enter your name , the object will create , and the system will allocate the necessary memory.Remember that with Java , when you `` delete '' an object , it does n't always fall immediately out of the memory stack . The Garbage Collection routine will occasionally filter through and `` de-allocate '' all those homeless memory pointers .",0

The kids want me to win them a tropy next year so im gon na do it . There are only a handfull of base plays that beginners need to know : Belly , Option , Sweep and Iso . Each play has its variations . There are at least thirty base option plays that have their own variations.The important thing is to know the basic idea of each . Play Madden , watch the games on TV , play with your buddies . More important than knowing the plays are your fundamental skills . Running the ball is a fraction of what backs need to do for their team to be successful . You will need to block , catch and run to contribute to your team .

The phrase `` voir dire '' derives from Middle French ; in modern English it is interpreted to mean `` speak the truth '' and generally refers to the process by which prospective jurors are questioned about their backgrounds and potential biases before being invited to sit on a jury.Sample Questions to be asked to prospective jurors:1 . Do you have an opinion concerning the alleged facts in the case ? 2.Are you related to anyone involved with this case ? 3.Have media accounts of this case caused you to form an opinion about the defendant ? 4 . Have you ever served on a jury before in a criminal case ? 5 . Do you believe our system of justice is fair ? 6 . Do you understand that the prosecution must show `` beyond a reasonable doubt '' that the defendant is guilty as charged ? 7 . Will it be hard for you to disregard evidence the judge rules as inadmissible after you 've heard it in open court ? 8 . Do you believe that the defendant is innocent until proven guilty in this court ? 9 . Is there any reason you ca n't sit as an impartial juror in this case ?,0

"Why does n't the Jewish religion believe in Jesus if he was a Jew ? Maybe this is all ignorance on my part . I do n't know . I really want to know . Truly and honestly , I 'm just trying to educate myself further . Any explanations are greatly appreciated . PLEASE look at the following : :http : //WhatJewsBelieve.orghttp : //Convert.org The basic beliefs of Christianity about Jesus are against what the Bible says , and so Real Jews can not believe in Jesus at all.The Christian understanding is that the Messiah , Jesus , died for the sins of the people . The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin.But we are taught in our Torah that no one can die for the sins of another . In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death forthe fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin ( eesh b ’ chet-o yumatu ) .In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself to atone for the sins of the people . To be written out of Gd 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . Gd 's response is No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : Exodus 32:30-35 And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Etrnl ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Etrnl , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Etrnl said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book . The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for Gd 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd will forgive us.So , the Bible is clear , no one can die for the sins of another , and this means that Jesus can not die for anyone else 's sins.Christians also believe that one needs a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin , that one who does not have such a blood sacrifice will die in their sins , and go to hell , except for the sacrifice of Jesus.This , too , is UnBiblical . The Bible describes blood sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin in the Book of Leviticus . But it is in Leviticus itself , in the middle of the discussion of the sin sacrifices , that we are taught that we do not need a blood sacrifice to be forgiven for our sins . Offering a blood sacrifice was an expensive thing to do for the family offering the animal . Was forgiveness then , to be only for the rich ? No , because if one could not afford a blood sacrifice then one who sins could bring flour , which has no blood and no life as their sacrifice , and Gd forgave them ! Leviticus 5:11-13 ; But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering ; he shall put no oil upon it , neither shall he put any frankincense thereon : for it is a sin offering.Furthermore , read the Book of Jonah . In Jonah , the People of Ninevah do three things in order to be forgiven by Gd . They fast , they pray for forgiveness , and they stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgave them ! This is exactly what we do on Yom Kippur , we fast , we pray for forgiveness , and , hopefully , we stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgives us . And what book do we read on Yom Kippur afternoon ? The Book of Jonah ! Jonah 3:7-10 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Ninevah , by the decree of the King and his nobles , saying , Let neither man nor beast , herd nor flock taste anything ; let them not feed nor drink water ; but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto Gd ; yea , let them turn every one from his evil",0

They 're the most common congenital malformations in newborns . In most cases scientists do n't know why they occur . Sometimes a viral infection causes serious problems . German measles ( rubella ) is an example . If a woman contracts German measles while pregnant , it can interfere with how her baby 's heart develops or produce other malformations . Other viral diseases also may cause congenital defects.Heredity sometimes plays a role in congenital cardiovascular defects . More than one child in a family may have a congenital cardiovascular defect , but this rarely occurs . Certain conditions affecting multiple organs , such as Down 's syndrome , can involve the heart , too . Some prescription drugs and over-the-counter medicines , as well as alcohol and `` street '' drugs , may increase the risk of having a baby with a heart defect .

"What is Trans Fat ? How to reduce that ? I heard that tras fat is bad for the body . Why is that ? Where can we find it in our daily food ? Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation , when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil . The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat , which raises `` bad '' LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease .

"why is probability sampling prefered over non probability sampling ? Probabilty sampling allows you to perform stastistical analysis , such as regression , correlation and so on . They can also be crafted to be extremely representative of the population . You can also construct confidence intervals ( for example : 54 % of Americans support the bill with a margin of error of +/- 2 % ) . You can also use stastitical methods to prove casality or other relationships . Non probability sampling can not be used with stastical analysis , thus we can have no margin or error , correlation , etc . However , given a sufficiently large sample size , non probability sampling can still be useful for getting a 'pulse ' of the total population .",0

"What do you think of President Bush sellin our ports to Arabs ? Update : `` He became aware of it over the last several days , '' McClellan said . Asked if Bush did not know about it until it was a done deal , McClellan said , `` That 's correct . `` First of all , I just want to say that it 's obvious not `` all Arabs are terrorists '' and objection to this port deal is not suggesting in the least bit that they are . You see a lot of the educated Congressmen , of both parties , objecting to the sale of these ports to a UAE company . These are intelligent , educated people and you think that they are objecting to this deal because they believe that all Arabs are terrorists ? I think not . The first perons who answered this question is the one who needs to get educated.It is justifiable to say that giving control of these major US ports to a company in the UAE poses a threat to national security . This situation is comparable to the notion of `` probable cause . '' If a police officer sees a person driving dangerously and erratically he has reason to believe that this person might be intoxicated . If two of the September 11 hijackers came from the UAE and money used to fund those attacks went through UAE banks , we have reason to believe that giving control of major ports to a UAE company is an added threat to security.There is no argument against the fact the UAE is located in a region of the world where anti-Western sentiment is strong . UAE control of these ports gives people a greater opportunity to act of these feelings.Sorry to say , but there is a difference between a British company operating these ports and a UAE company operating these ports . I am a strong supporter of President Bush on 95 % of the issues , but I do not know where his head is regarding this issue , if he really did know about this before the deal was made .",0

"nursing care plan who had post op TAH-BSO ? Are you a nursing student with lack of resources ? Anyone who has had this medical procedure needs to carefully follow her doctor 's advice and report any signs or symptoms which could indicate complications.I had it done . Other than report anything which seems abnormal ( and do n't let strange things shock the nurse or whoever , get a serious response in the rare event it does happen- such as passing gas or stool vaginally ) . Things I found helpful was support the abdomenal area with a folded blanket or pillow when getting up or coughing or sitting in a chair even . Once you go on a regular diet be sure to get lots of fluids , eat foods that give bulk to your stool without the extra gas and walk as much as your doctor allows you to without over doing it . It is very important to avoid constipation which can stretch your colon into a pouch . That pouch could cause problems for years to come . Just let your doctor know if constipation does become an issue . Get your rest and push yourself a bit more each day as you are able to tolerate it . The healing process needs time , but you will get there . If you are a nursing student , I would strongly suggest you invest in a care plan book with information that you need to know in order to provide the proper care to your patients . Good luck .",0

"Which is the world 's oldest religion ? ? The world 's oldest religion , atleast chronologically from a historic perspective is Hinduism ( Sanatana Dharma ) . However , please keep in mind that everyone of every religion considers their religion to not be 'new ' . Christianity is seen as a fulfillment of prophecies based in Judaism . Baha'i is based upon prophecies in Islam . So as far as Judaism , Christianity , Islam , and Baha'i , if you ask a member of this religion they can each point backwards through the Abrahamic traditions to how each 'fulfilled ' other areas , thus keeping them within the same line . THe same can be said of Buddhism , Jainism , Sikhism , etc . So when asking this question it is best to be aware of what exactly you are wanting to know . As one Christian I know said `` Jesus was a part of God in the begining , thus Christianity is the oldest religion because Jesus was always a part of God , but it is young if you only compare it from a historic chronological perspective . '' I think that is well said.Thus from a Historice Chronological Perspective from oldest to youngest the religions go : HinduismZoroastrianismJudaismJainismBuddhismTaoismConfucismShintoChristianityIslamSikhismBaha'iNeoPaganism*Please note that many in the NeoPagan movement claim direct connection to the Pagan past and often direct it to a specific ancient culture/civilization , but not all . Some state that theirs is a new religion based upon a revitalization of ancient religions , but not the ancient religions themselves . So one has to be careful in this area , too . Native American beliefs and Shamanism are not listed , nor did I name Unitarian-Universalism , Rastafarianism , etc . I mainly listed major world religions . ( UUs do not necessarily view themselves as a religion in itself , but rather an approach to religion with many in a UU congregation holding a wide variety of beliefs from many of the worlds religions .

"How much money has Haliburton and its alliliates made from government contracts since 9/11 ? Who came second ? I 'm not sure of the exact figure but here are some figures that might help clarify the situation : Halliburton has received $ 7.8 billion in U.S. taxpayer assistance since 1992 ( excluding money from the Pentagon ) . Please bear in mind that this money has nothing to do with actual government ( mostly military ) contracts and thus constitutes a corporate `` handout '' for a multi-billion dollar conglomerate . The value of Halliburton 's government contracts increased by nearly 100 percent , from $ 1.2 billion to $ 2.3 billion , during Dick Cheney 's tenure as CEO . Since becoming vice president , Cheney has NOT divested himself of his Halliburton stock and has in fact continued to increase the company 's ( and his own ) profits . ( Note : An internal Pentagon email proves that a $ 7 billion no-bid contract awarded to Halliburton on March 8 , 2003 was `` coordinated '' with Cheney 's office . ) It is a safe bet that we are talking tens of billions ( with a B ) of dollars in Halliburton 's coffers since 9/11 , much of that money courtesy of Cheney and all of it courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer .

M1 Abrams is USA MBT ( Main Battle Tank ) , of course it have better armor and better firepower . M2 Bradley only have a single 25mm machinegun , another machinegun placed coaxially and several TOWs missile ( more later variant carry less missiles ) meanwhile M1 have a 12.7mm machinegun , two 7.62mm machinegun and one 105 mm rifled tank gun ( for original M1 ) or 120 mm smoothbore gun ( for M1A1 & M1A2 ) that able to shoot many type of shells . Obviously , M1 have better accuracy than M2 ( M1 have better aiming equipment ) , considering M1 main role ( M2 is APC , not MBT ) . M2 was created because the existing APC at that time ca n't compete with M1 speed , hindering M1 overall movement . So using M1 base , they create M2 , APC version of M1.So , M1 absolutely tougher and have more firepower than M2 . And they both have the same speed . And for reliable , as they have different role ( MBT and APC ) , I ca n't say which is better . But one thing for sure , M2 is n't bad because their survivability rate is very high.Of course , in battle , I feel a lot safer in M1 than in M2 . But if I can choose , I definitely want to be inside Merkava Mk-IV , it 's the best MBT in this world ( of course , it 's more superior than M1 Abrams ) .",0

"name the us possessions and territories ? A History of United States Insular Areas : How the Relationships Began From 1899 to 1941 , Guam was under U.S . Naval Administration . At the outbreak of World War II , the Japanese seized Guam and occupied the island for two and a half years . American forces recaptured Guam in July 1944 , and the U.S . Naval Administration resumed responsibility when peace returned.In 1950 , the U.S. Government enacted the Guam Organic Act , conferring U.S. citizenship on the people of Guam and establishing local self-government . Under the Organic Act of 1950 , the Secretary of the Interior assumed administrative responsibility for Guam , formerly vested in the Secretary of the Navy.The United States purchased the Virgin Islands for $ 25 million from Denmark in 1917 . The Virgin Islands were placed under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy until they were transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1931.Interior 's relationship with other U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands stemmed from a post-World War II trusteeship . The Northern Mariana Islands , the Marshall , Palau , Yap , Kosrae , Chuuk and Pohnpei Islands were grouped into the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands ( TTPI ) by the United Nations in 1947 . Under the Trusteeship Agreement with the U.N. Security Council , the United States exercised administrative jurisdiction over the TTPI.The Navy administered the TTPI until 1951 , when that authority was given to the Secretary of the Interior . During those initial years of authority , the Secretary of the Interior exercised broad administrative authority in all the insular areas . Chief executives of the insular governments were appointees of the President or the Secretary and the Secretary had the legal authority to supervise and give binding directions to them.However , this is no longer the case . Popularly elected legislatures ( Guam-1950 , USVI-1954 , American Samoa-1961 , and the CNMI-1979 ) and governors ( Guam and USVI 1971 , American Samoa 1978 , the CNMI , 1979 ) were established . Each of the U.S. insular areas has become responsible for the administration of local government functions . Although the Congress has placed with the Secretary , certain continuing budget and program coordination authority and responsibility concerning U.S. insular affairs , the local governments are not entities of the Department , nor are they agencies or instrumentalities of the Federal Government.Except for CNMI , which became a commonwealth of the U.S. , the remaining TTPI entities chose a dramatically different political status.On May l , l979 , the United States recognized the Constitution of the Marshall Islands and the establishment of the Government of the Marshall Islands ( RMI ) . The United States recognized the Federated States of Micronesia ( FSM ) constitution in 1979 and establishment of the Government of the FSM , both national and state levels . FSM created the 4 State levels from the islands of Yap , Chuuk , Pohnpei and Kosrae.On October 1 , 1994 , the Compact of Free Association between the United States and Palau entered into force , ( U.S. Public Law 99-658 ) . The Compact entered into force for the Marshall Islands on October 2l , l986 , ( Presidential Proclamation No . 5564 ) . The FSM Compact was fully implemented on November 3 , 1986 ( Presidential Proclamation No . 5564 ) .Under the Compact , the status of free association recognizes each Freely Associated State as a sovereign state with the capacity to conduct foreign affairs consistent with the terms of the Compact . The Compact places full responsibility for defense with the United States . The Compact also provides grant funds and Federal program assistance , principally through the Department of the Interior.Under the Compact , the State Department is responsible for government-to-government relations , while Interior is responsible for the oversight and coordination of U.S. programs and funding assistance.District of ColumbiaAmerican SamoaGuamPuerto RicoNorthern Marianas",0

"Have you ever torn a ligament in your knee , how long does it take to heal ? I dislocated my knee about 3 months ago . I was supposed to keep my knee stabilized- completely immobile for a long time , but I did n't know that . I did this 10 yrs ago to my other knee . It seems like this one is healing slower . I still have pain when I walk , and sometimes it still feels like my knee is going backwards when I walk . I 'll get shooting pains up and down the outside of my knee just out of the blue . I just recently feel like my walk is almost back to normal . I went to the doctor for a recheck about 3 weeks ago , and asked her the same question you just did . She told me everyone is different , and the knees always take a very , very long time to heal . I now am taking glucosimine for my joints . Its just something you can pick up at a vitamin store .

"I ve a very severe short sightedness which affects just an eye and doctors say glasses wo n't help . pls advice The doctor says the use of a glasses is out of the question since just one eye is affected and a thick lens according 2 him will affect d other eye and moreso i will ve a multiple vision Well , I do n't know the specifics of your problem , but I can offer a bit of an explanation of what your doctor said . Glasses would n't help you because the lenses for each eye would be dramatically different . Since you 're very near-sighted in the one eye , you would need a very strong lens that would ultimately make the image on your retina much smaller than the image on your other retina . If these two images are very different sizes , your brain ca n't put them together into one image and you see double . If both of your eyes can be corrected to 20/20 vision , I would ask your doctor ( or another doctor , if you 'd like a second opinion ) if LASIK is an option for you . This could possibly bring your very near-sighted eye close enough to the other eye so that your brain would be able to make a single image .",0

She introduced me to her good friend Yuko and nudged her to dance with me . I 'm a pretty funny dancer so we had a good time laughing at me and drinking . Then the party ended and we were walking to an after party and began chatting . I felt a chemistry building with her even though the conversation came a bit difficult . We hung out at the party for about 5 mins when I just could n't deny the chemistry there , so I asked her if she wanted to go for a walk . This time the conversation was much easier and we were alone we walked a block discussing our college lives and asking questions about her experiences in America etc . we headed back to the party and I felt really good about her . On the elevator ride up there was a long awkward silence and just before the elevator reached our floor I took her and kissed her , and then , silence . It was great .",0

"If jesus is Lord / God when he died on the cross who kept the universe in order ? Is the trinity false ? Excellent question . But unfortunately , I have yet to hear a good answer . God the Almighty Creator does n't even blink for a second , nonetheless die . If this were true and God died on the cross , then ALL existance would cease.Here 's what makes the trinity questionable : If you have a creature ( i.e . a created being ) , and a third of that creature dies while the other two-thirds are still alive , then that creature has n't really died . All parts would have to die for the creature to be considered dead . So if this applies to a created being , how can it not apply to the Creator ? If a third of God dies , but the other two-thirds are still alive , then that third did n't really die ; especially when he 's resurrected within a number of hours.The fact is that death in itself is a creation . Therefore the dimension of death can not be applied to an infinite entity which exists outside the realm of all creation . i.e . No creator , or any part of a creator , dies.What does that mean anyways ? What does it mean that a third of God has died ? ? ? This can only indicate that the trinity is not true ; it 's merely a pagan practice that has filtered down to blemish the noble message of Prophet Jesus ( peace be upon him ) . ( see link below ) For those who say angels , well who was sustaining the angels in God 's absence ? Did you really hear yourself say that ? ?",0

"Most gelogists think that the movement of Earth 's plates is caused by what ? a. gravityb . subductionc . convection currentsd . Earths magnetic fields The best answer from the above choices : Slow moving convection currents within the molten aesthenosphere supply new material to the spreading centers in the earth 's ocean floors and other places . These currents are thought to provide force to cause the motion of the oceanic plates , either directly , or indirectly through the mid ocean ridge building process . Subduction is only one part of the process of plate tectonics , that does provide some driving force by pulling the subducting plate downward . Gravity has a role as well , as without gravity , the mid-ocean ridges would not have the weight to provide force with which to push the plates apart at the spreading centers , and the subducting plates would not have the force to pull plates . The earth 's magnetic field may have the least to do with plate tectonics , possibly no role at all .",0

Do any drugs make it speed up or flare up ? What is known ? Sun is bad , does it cause it to speed up too ? NCB Seems like they do n't know much about MS . The cause of progression in MS is unknown . A relapse can occur if you become over-heated , overly stressed , overly fatigued ... or it can just happen . No lifestyles that I 'm aware of make a difference in the progression . No foods , either . Supplements that boost your immune system should be avoided , because MS is a disease caused by an `` over active '' immune stem in the first place . Anything that stimulates your immune system could lead to a new attack or an exacerbation . The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people diagnosed with MS begin treating with the `` ABC '' drugs ( Avonex , Betaseron , or Copaxone ) as soon as possible .

"Do Publishing Companies Enforce Copyright Infringement Lawsuits ? I have a friend who was selling solutions manuals on ebay ( PDF files ) and ebay stopped the listings but not before he sold several manuals . My friend is not a bigtime operator and did n't know the copyright laws . One of the publishing companies recently sent him a letter telling him that he commited piracy and that they could sue him for LOTS of money and possibly even have him pay for their law fees . However they also said that they would give him 10 days to accept a resolution in which he would pay the companies all profits derived from the manuals and an additional $ 100 dollars for legal costs incurred to date . If my friend does not accept the resolution will the publishing company file a suit ? Can they really ask for an additional $ 100 dollars ? My friend would love some advice ... preferably from somebody familiar with the law . Thank you ! Ignorance of the law is no excuse and no defense . The oopyright statement is WRITTEN RIGHT IN THE MANUALS your friend was selling !

"how do I date a woman and make her feel confortable with me ? As to how you date , it depends on your culture . In the US , you ask her to go to dinner and a movie .

Do n't try to [ hold hands / kiss / have sex ] on the first night , for instance , again depending on your culture . Ask her about her interests instead of talking about yours.Depending on your age and experience , she will probably be as nervous or not nervous as you . Two 16-year olds are ALWAYS nervous . A 40-year old divorced man and a 40-year old widow should be less nervous ; they have seen more of life .

"What is the best Tarot Deck and why ? Personally , I use the Rider Waite deck . It is my preference , because that is the one that I originally started using , and am comfortable with it . My friend uses The Fairy Oracle Deck . The graphics on the cards are very pretty . There are so many different decks out there , but I prefer to stay with Rider Waite and keep it less complicated ! Universal Waite Decks have the same pics on the cards , and the colors are better . The Universal Waite deck is a more modern version of the Rider Waite deck .",0

"Do any Jews live the Old Testament Laws ? Is there a 12 day period ever month of no sex for husband and wife. ? That is for wives that are pre-menopause . First , we dont call out Bible the 'Old Testament ' because we dont believe there is a new one.However , yes , the Orthodox Jewish community still follows the laws you describe above.By the way , this means that for roughly 2 weeks each month , a Jewish couple who follow this law will not have sex as an issue between them . It means that for half of each month , they must relate to each other as platonic friends , and this makes the relationship far stronger , and is one reason given for the very low divorce rate throughout the history of the Jewish People . Only since the Jews have assimilated , become like their non-Jewish neighbors , has the divorce rate risen to the same rate as among their non-Jewish counterparts , but continues to remain low among the orthodox .",0

You will put some vaseline in the face of the doll , just a small amount.We need this , because when you will finish your artistic work , it will be easier for you to separate the mask from the doll.2 . Then you will put the first gauze in the water just for a second ; now place this gauze in the face of the doll and continue doing the same thing with the other gauzes.You have to create at least 4 or 5 layers of these special gauzes . 3 . Then let them dry in the room . 4 . After that you can paint it as you prefer and separate it from the doll 's face.Good luck ! Katerina",0

"What is a good start for a man over 40 , weight traning and cardio plan ? I am in fairly good shape . Matt , I would recommend that you start with a check-up with your doctor , just to make sure you are in otherwise good shape . Having done this you are good to go . Although not widely known , weight lifters normally have better cardio systems than runners , just not the lung capacity . At 40 , I would recommend starting with a moderate weight lifting routine on machines . Later you can switch to free weights as you get stronger . Free weights are better in some respect in that you have to control the weights . However , most modern machine weights are designed to give you a workout throughout the complete range of motion . Make sure you get plenty of rest between reps and do n't over do it to start with . Also add moderate stretching and decent nutrition . You do n't have to give up all good foods , because as you add muscle your body will consume more calories , even at rest . Sometimes the muscle aches caused by the minor tears in the muscle during working out do n't appear for 48 hours . The tears rebuild and realign into stronger muscle tissue . Take your time . Normally about 3 weeks of moderate weight lifting will begin to show results . A little weight gain can be expected if you are n't also dieting , but the weight gain does not mean size gain . Muscle is denser , so a pound of muscle is not as big as a pound of fat . Good luck ole boy and welcome to the over 40 club . By the way . Since I turned 40 I have dated women ranging in age from 19 to 56 , so if you are n't married , it 's a whole new world out there .",0

"Why should things like language change just for the sake of new generations ? Case in point . Language may change for clarity and definition , such as the reason for thee , thou , thy and thine . Ok , you , your , and yours , which I still believe are acceptable for Worship , and religious expressions ; The Spanish Language uses that form for familiarity among personal relatives ; but did you know that the words `` blessed '' , `` doth '' `` knowest '' and `` thinketh '' can be related to a `` lisp tongue '' ie , . `` All I want for Chrithmath ith my two front teeth '' . Therefore a word like blessed would be pronouced `` Blethed '' and thinks `` thinkth '' or phonetically `` thinketh '' .My real point , however , is that most of todays language changes are perverse , gutteral , and obscene . As for traditions ; only the most valuable ones , based upon morality and righteousness , are becoming extinct.I ask you ; what do you say ? Language does n't change for the sake of a new generation . The change had already started generations before . Who came up with the obscenities in the first place ? Who decided that these sounds when put together to make words would be vulgar ? This is an interesting question . Your examples are interesting , also . I 'm not sure it is quite that simple . I 'm thinking that you would need a nation of people to lose their teeth permanently for at least a couple of generations for the new pronunciation to take effect .",0

"Why does science and religion conflict with each other so much ? Old Goat is correct . It would help to know specifics . But consider just ONE example . The book of Job is the oldest book in the Bible . It even predates Moses . So , in that period of time , how did other cultures view the earth ? Flat , supported by Atlas or giant elephants ... But look what it reads in the book of Job ... `` God hangs the earth on nothing . '' And in Isaiah it reads , `` It is God who sits above the circle of the earth . '' That word `` circle '' in Hebrew is ball or sphere . So if people poopoo the Bible with their lofty scientific thinking , they have probably not even read the Bible to check . I know scientists who have read the Bible , and are amazed at how accurate it is.We know that all matter is made up of atoms and electrons . I nor any scientist has ever seen an electron . But because of scientific study , we know they exist . The Bible reads in Hebrews 11:3 ... '' Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear . `` So the only conflict comes when secular scientist blow off the Bible without cause .

I finally found out I had some depression issues . Got some great little happy pills fron the Doc that make life easier . But it comes down to this , Pain and depression and suffering are all part of growing up and they turn into strength and experience . That strength grows each time you suffer . You can use that later in life to help other people.Maybe you should talk to someone about treatment for depression . It 's diferent for everyone . Suicide is not the answer .",0

"How can I expose mail fraud at the USPS without getting fired ? already contacted the US Postal Inspector -- -he did n't have time . If the fraud is against the government you can use what is called the Qui-Tam statute . This is a law originally begun by Abraham Lincoln during the civil war to reward people who reported fraud in the war effort . It has been used in a variety of situations such as defense contractor fraud and healthcare fraud . The person who brings it to light is called the relator , who with the help of an attorney files a lawsuit that is not public information ( under seal ) . The government reviews the case and determines if it has merit . If they agree , they intervene and the case proceeds . At the end of the case the relator receives a portion of whatever the government recovers .",0

"How are white water rafting rapids categorized ? class i : easy . fast moving water with riffles and small waves . few obstructions , all obvious and easily missed with little training . risk to swimmers is slight ; self-rescue is easy.class ii : novice . straightforward rapids with wide , clear channels which are evident without scouting . occasional maneuvering may be required , but rocks and medium sized waves are easily missed by trained paddlers . swimmers are seldom injured and group assistance , while helpful , is seldom needed . rapids that are at the upper end of this difficulty range are designated `` class ii+ '' .class iii : intermediate . rapids with moderate , irregular waves which may be difficult to avoid and which can swamp an open canoe . complex maneuvers in fast current and good boat control in tight passages or around ledges are often required ; large waves or strainers may be present but are easily avoided . strong eddies and powerful current effects can be found , particularly on large-volume rivers . scouting is advisable for inexperienced parties . injuries while swimming are rare ; self-rescue is usually easy but group assistance may be required to avoid long swims . rapids that are at the lower or upper end of this difficulty range are designated `` class iii- '' or `` class iii+ '' respectively.class iv : advanced . intense , powerful but predictable rapids requiring precise boat handling in turbulent water . depending on the character of the river , it may feature large , unavoidable waves and holes or constricted passages demanding fast maneuvers under pressure . a fast , reliable eddy turn may be needed to initiate maneuvers , scout rapids , or rest . rapids may require ômust '' moves above dangerous hazards . scouting may be necessary the first time down . risk of injury to swimmers is moderate to high , and water conditions may make self-rescue difficult . group assistance for rescue is often essential but requires practiced skills . a strong eskimo roll is highly recommended . rapids that are at the upper end of this difficulty range are designated `` class iv- '' or `` class iv+ '' respectively.class 5 : expert . extremely long , obstructed , or very violent rapids which expose a paddler to added risk . drops may contain large , unavoidable waves and holes or steep , congested chutes with complex , demanding routes . rapids may continue for long distances between pools , demanding a high level of fitness . what eddies exist may be small , turbulent , or difficult to reach . at the high end of the scale , several of these factors may be combined . scouting is recommended but may be difficult . swims are dangerous , and rescue is often difficult even for experts . a very reliable eskimo roll , proper equipment , extensive experience , and practiced rescue skills are essential . because of the large range of difficulty that exists beyond class iv , class 5 is an open ended , multiple level scale designated by class 5.0 , 5.1 , 5.2 , etc ... each of these levels is an order of magnitude more difficult than the last . example : increasing difficulty from class 5.0 to class 5.1 is a similar order of magnitude as increasing from class iv to class 5.0. class vi : extreme and exploratory . these runs have almost never been attempted and often exemplify the extremes of difficulty , unpredictability and danger . the consequences of errors are very severe and rescue may be impossible . for teams of experts only , at favorable water levels , after close personal inspection and taking all precautions . after a class vi rapids has been run many times , it 's rating may be changed to an apppropriate class 5.x rating .",0

I water once or twice/week ( usually once/week ) and fertilize every three months or so with the little plant food sticks that you bury in the soil .

Then after lobbing the top off a few times over the years ( think carefully , and take a deep breath for this ) buds for new 'runners ' seemed to spring up even lower down , and it has become more tree-like ; branching at the top .

On the third day 59 people came , 17 more than on the second day . If each day 17 more people saw the movie than the day before , on what day would 500 people have seen the movie ? He solved it by adding adding , I want to give him a better way . The sum of the first N numbers is known to be : 1 + 2 + ... + N = N ( N+1 ) /2 ( Gauss formula ) If we write the values for N = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... we obtain the sequence:1 , 3 , 6 , 10 , 15 , 21 , 28 , 36 , 45 , 55 , ...

"why world think that muslims are terrorists ? ? Muslims are terrorists if all Germans are nazis , Americans are gangsters , Columbians are drug dealers , Italians are mafia members and ... .I think thats because the only news from muslims which news companies spread is about terrorism.Propaganda has great powers and it can make you believe that muslims are terrorist.After cold war when the danger of communism vanished western governments need an enemy and there was n't anyone better than muslims.Maybe it is true that some famous terrorist are muslim but it is also true that muslim countries have suffered from many unwanted problems e.g . afghanestan which was american front during cold war for controlling the communism movement in middle east which is one of the most important oil producers in world and believe me , there is nothing remained there except ruined cities and mountain and minefield and vast fields of poppy which is used to make opium and heroin in great amounts . this is a proper place for terrorism to grow . so I think muslims are wrongfuly accused .",0

"What is the easiest way to get a college degree on the net ? Is n't an easy way to do it , in fact , for some people it is more difficult to get an online degree than a traditional classroom based degree . You need a lot of self-discipline , high reading ability , and motivation to do a lot of learning on your own to do an online program . The only part of an online program that people view as `` easier '' is that you are n't necessarily tied down to a particular time of day to do your work . So , if you are a night owl you can do all your work at night , for example.That said , if you are interested in an online degree then you should seek a degree from a school that also has an established classroom based degree program . Recognize that many people still have a stigma toward internet degrees , so having a degree from an established college/university will lessen the stigma . Hope this helps .",0

"How did `` black comedy '' and `` rap music '' evolved from minstrel shows in America ? Minstrel shows were obstensibly a caricature of African-American culture , reaching the height of their popularity in the mid-19th Century.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_showBy and large , rap and hip-hop developed in the 1970 's as a natural progression from disco , jazz , beat poetry , raggae , and other African Diasporic cultural genres interacting with each other and creating something new.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_musicHumor , as an entertainment genre , created and performed by African-Americans does n't have much of a presence in American popular culture until the 70's.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_sitcomhttp : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special : Search ? search=african+american+comedians & go=GoIn this way , there 's not much of a direct relationship between minstrel shows and contemporary African-American entertainment in terms of `` lineage . '' However , racism - of which minstrel shows are one example - is a frequent topic of discussion.Example - In the `` When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong '' sketch of Chappelle 's Show Season 2 episode 7 : Dave plays Vernon Franklin , an African-American yuppie who feels like an `` Uncle Tom '' because he likes and gets along with his white co-workers . So instead of letting an awkward comment from co-worker and mentor Frank Murphy slide , he over-reacts.Frank : Vernon , great job buddy . You da man ! Give me some skin , huh ? Vernon : Get your m*f*in hand out of my face , man . You heard me m*f*er get your hand out of my face ! What you think this is - just shake my hand like a man ! .. ' Gim me some five , on the black-hand side , with all this crazy jive ' ? That 's b*s* . Do you want a little soft-shoe ? Should I juggle some watermelon ? Man ; f* all that ! Obviously , the humor is in the over-reaction . But at the same time , Chappelle is tapping into the sensitivity many people have concerning racial stereotypes : The comment about `` dancing a soft-shoe '' is a direct reference to minstrel show caricaturing of African-Americans .",0

"what is ocx ? Short for OLE Control Extension , an independent program module that can be accessed by other programs in a Windows environment . OCX controls end with a .ocx extension .

Unlike first-generation 16-bit Visual Basic controls ( VBXs ) , which were only written in Visual Basic , OCXs can be written in several languages and come in 16-bit and 32-bit versions . OCXs were renamed ActiveX controls and continue to use the .OCX file extension . Both VBX and OCX controls have now been superseded by ActiveX controls .

"why is the Van Allen radiation belts have to surround to earth ? The Van Allen belts have very little to do with the earth 's core as the other answer suggested . They are believed to be created by the eath 's magnetic field interacting with charged particles known as solar wind . To the extent that we believe the earth 's core responsible for creating the earth 's magnetic field , I guess the earth 's core has some relevance . As the solar winds encounter the earth 's magnetic field , the radiation becomes trapped within the field . They are repelled from areas of stronger magnetic field where field lines converge . Two alternative hypotheses have been proposed . Possibly the Van Allen Belts are lefor over from the aurora , and another argument is that they are the result of volcanic activity of the earth . Some scientists beleive that they may have a beneficial effect on the planet providing some protection from solar wind , and that weakening them would harm both electronics and living organisms . there has been a proposal to reduce the charge of the belts , which are a hazard to satellites .",0

"What is the most ancient religion still being practiced ? HinduismAccording to historians , the origin of Hinduism dates back to 5000 or more years . The word `` Hindu '' is derived from the name of River Indus , which flows through northern India . In ancient times the river was called the 'Sindhu ' , but the Persians who migrated to India called the river 'Hindu ' , the land 'Hindustan ' and its inhabitants 'Hindus ' . Thus the religion followed by the Hindus came to be known as 'Hinduism ' .",0
"how does heart rate change when something scary happens ? Adrenaline is released into the blood stream . Another name for Adrenaline is Epinephrine.Epinephrine plays a central role in the short-term stress reaction—the physiological response to threatening or exciting conditions . It is secreted by the adrenal medulla . When released into the bloodstream , epinephrine binds to multiple receptors and has numerous effects throughout the body . It increases heart rate and stroke volume , dilates the pupils , and constricts arterioles in the skin and gut while dilating arterioles in leg muscles . It elevates the blood sugar level by increasing hydrolysis of glycogen to glucose in the liver , and at the same time begins the breakdown of lipids in fat cells .",0

"How do u make an ice-rink in ur backyard ? ? ? ? ? ? I want 2 make 1 but i dont no how . I made a workable ice rink for my daughter in our back yard while she was very young . She later competed in figure skating competitions.At a hardware store , buy a roll of plastic that opens as wide and at least as long as your rink will be . The plastic is only a few mils thick and usually comes in black or clear , for example it is used as a painting drop cloth , etc . The thicker the better . Clear will absorb less sunlight avoiding melting.Lay out the rink using a tape measure to a length and width slightly less than the dimensions that tthe single sheet of plastic sheet will be . Overlapping sheets may drain unless poured slowly in very cold weather . Before the ground is frozen , dig a trench all around the rink inside your lines and make a pile of soil all around the outside of the trench that will be slightly higher than the ground inside the rink . Lay down the plastic sheet over the ground and trench and piled earth . Fill the plastic covered ground with water nearly to the top of the earth piles and let it freeze . Add more watter if needed.You can make your rink square or rectangular or even oval and size will depend on the plastic sheet and your space available . Do not walk on the plastic sheet because you may make drain holes . A double layer of plastic would help avoid puncture from sharp stones , etc . Try to build on very level ground as water will seek a level surface . Try to build away from anything that could cause injury if a skater lost control or fell outside the rink . Try to avoid skating on the edge which would cut the plastic and allow water to drain during a thaw . Perhaps provide a piece of old carpet where skaters have to step over the edge . Do enjoy ! Good luck.BTW our pump water had a lot of mineral and did not make good ice . City water or rain water would have been much better - but it worked !",0

"On my mobo I have a 4pin power plug and a 20pin power plug , which do I use ? My 450watt PSU has the 4pin plug for the motherboard but does not have the 20pin . It does have a 24pin though which I can not figure out what it goes on.Any suggestions ? Do I NEED both of them or just the 4pin ? You do need both . The power supply you have is a later version of the ATX form factor . Basically , your power supply has more pins because it 's made with the later standard . Your motherboard is probably fairly old and/or basic . In any case , you should be able to plug the 24-pin plug into the the 20-pin socket without a problem ( it should only fit one way ) .

Did it hurt using a tampon for the first time ? the best advice is that when trying out tampons for the first time you need to relax ... your vagina is controlled by a muscle and if you 're tense that muscle can tighten up and make it a little uncomfortable to insert the tampon ...

"How can there be many ways to God ? Let not your heart be troubled : ye believe in God , believe also in me . Jesus saith unto him , I am the way , the truth , and the life : no man cometh unto the Father , but by me.If ye had known me , ye should have known my Father also : and from henceforth ye know him , and have seen him.Can it be shown in scripture ? Can it be shown in any other writings from God ? If it can not be shown , why not ? May God bless you all for your answers..In Jesus Most Precious Name..EyeLovesJesus For those who say there are many ways because there are so many people I respectfully disagree . The is only one God and one Way . Do most know that the early church was actually called The Way ? Why because the followed the One who said there is only One Way that being Christ . How can there be many ways when they are all so different . Some say works , some sacrafice , some even say self reliance . But consider this if God is perfect can you stand before Him ? Can you say let me in for I am a rightous man on my own certinly not . So then we need to be perfect before the Father . Can we do anything to be perfect ? Certinly not . For being a christian will not get you into heaven , on the contary being a christian will get you no where . Jesus on the other hand can stand before the Father , He can be Rightous and Holy before God on your behalf . But not if you do not accept Him for what He is and for what He has done . For on the day of judgment ( there will be judgement ) The Father will judge all men and see whom is in His Son and they shall be forgiven . Only one way to heaven , thank the Lord we have a way .

"What made you interested in web accessibility ? As with CSS , my first real contact with accessibility came with my job at Salford . Although I was peripherally aware of the concept , and had previously heard mentions of the WCAG ( Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ) , it was never something I thought I needed to concern myself with . However , researching some of the legal requirements involving educational websites in the UK , I inevitably came across SENDA ( Special Educational Needs and Disabilities Act ) and the wider DDA ( Disabilities Discrimination Act ) . To summarise very broadly , the DDA demands , among other things , that the provision of goods and services should be ( within reason ) accessible to anybody . In its initial state , the DDA did only cover businesses and government bodies , making a special exception for educational establishments . SENDA , which effectively became part IV of the DDA , removed this special status , bringing education back under the general provisions of the main DDA . Although the Act itself does not directly mention web sites , the 'Code of Practice - Rights of Access Goods , Facilities , Services and premises ' does , and it is understood that therefore all government , education and business sites need to make 'reasonable adjustments ' to ensure a basic level of accessibility . So , having started my position as web editor at the University of Salford and realising the legal requirement imposed by SENDA/DDA , I began delving deeper into the subject of accessibility . What I found was that , even among 'seasoned ' web managers in the UK education sector and beyond , there was a lot of ignorance and confusion - coupled with misinformed management concerned with 'Bobby validation ' as the be all and end all . This sorry state of affairs , combined with the fact that , deep down , I feel that accessibility is simply the ethically/morally right thing to do , led me to explore this subject further . I find it fascinating that even though in recent years more and more sites , books and even conferences have been devoted to accessibility , there are still many grey areas once you move beyond the basics , where even experts can furiously disagree . It 's not all cut and dry , and in many instances one has to take a pragmatic approach , weighing up how things should be done ( according to things like W3C specifications or even common sense ) against how they work in practice ( in light of flaky browser or assistive technology support , for instance ) .",0

"What did captain James Cook say about the Aborigines ? Captain Cook had two encounters with the aborigines . At Kurnell near Sydney , the expedition landed and some natives threw spears at the party while muskets were fired at return.At Cooktown where the Endeavour run aground , relations were friendly . The kangaroo was named during this encounter when Cook asked what the animal was called and the natives replied kangaroo which meant I do n't know . Cook also met briefly with aboriginals on Bruny Island in 1777.Based on his limited meeting , Cook developed an incorrect impression that the inland was largely unoccupied . However , the Encyclopedia of Aboriginal Australia published in 1994 , reports that Cooks comments about aboriginals ( who he called Indians ) were generally complimentary .",0

"despite much phlosophies , religion , wise people , why is there much conflicts locally and globlally ? Despite all the religions of the world and their constant advocating of peace and justice , things are pretty violent on the third planet . Religion itself must share some of the blame . All religions tend to cultivate a sense of absolutism : the idea that one is right , and others are wrong , and that 's just how it is . This sort of thinking leads to the next step : if others are wrong and evil , why do the good people have to tolerate them ? From that thought , the bullets begin to fly , and the mass graves are filled up quickly .

"whats the best way to fight a cold ? The best way to fight the common cold virusEvery year , as each winter season approaches us , it gets harder and harder for people to avoid getting a cold . It never fails , just as soon as the weather changes a little and starts to turn cold , people begin to sniffle , sneeze and cough and the symptoms of the common cold begin to come around once again.But before you run out to the nearest store to buy a supply of tissues , cold medicine and soup , you need to understand exactly what you are up against . Your chances of being exposed to a cold germ will increase or decrease depending on the amount of contact you have with other people and how you take care of yourself.The cold germ is spread from person to person when someone , who is infected , sneezes or coughs into the air or on you . The airborne germ then enters someone else ’ s body through an orifice , like your eyes , nose or mouth . You can also catch a cold by touching something that a person who has been infected has also touched and then touching your mouth , nose or eyes.There are many things that you can do to prevent yourself from getting a cold.1 . You should wash your hands a lot . This frequent hand washing , especially when using any anti-bacterial soap , will help you to get rid of any potential germs that you might have come into contact with.2 . You should carry and use anti-bacterial hand lotion several times throughout the day . Use it especially when you can not get to a bathroom and you know you have touched something infected or have been near an infected person.3 . You should also get plenty of sleep or rest . If you are tired and fatigued , your body ’ s resistance decreases and you will find that you are more susceptible to colds.There are many ways that you can fight a cold once you have caught one.1 . You should eat spicy foods . Spicy hot foods will cause your body to expel mucus . When you eat these types of foods , your nose will start to run and you will begin to cough up mucus . Spicy foods work just like a natural decongestant but without side effects . This advice is good for those people who can not take over the counter medication.2 . You should drink plenty of liquids . Liquids like soup , water , juice and flat ginger ale will keep your body hydrated . This is true especially if you have a fever . During a fever , your body loses a lot of fluids . You will need to replenish what you have lost . Therefore you need to drink often throughout your illness . You should also avoid drinking any dairy drinks because the dairy will cause mucus to form and coat your throat making it very difficult for you to swallow and cough.3 . You should use a vaporizer . It will keep the air that you breathe moist . If you do not have a vaporizer handy , then just crack open the windows in your home . This is very important if you have an extremely warm and dry home . Cracking the windows will have the same effects that a vaporizer has .",0

"How are geodes formed , where are found and what minerals do they contain ? Geodes ( Greek geoides , `` earthlike '' ) are geological formations common to the United States ( Indiana , Iowa , and Kentucky ) , Brazil , and Mexico . Essentially rock bubbles with internal crystal formations , the exterior of a geode is generally limestone or a related rock , while the interior contains quartz crystals and/or chalcedony deposits . Other geodes are completely filled with crystal , being solid all the way though . These types of geodes are called nodules.Geologists do not yet have a widely accepted theory about how geodes are formed , but it is believed geodes can form in any cavity that is buried . These can be bubbles in igneous rocks , pockets under tree roots , bubbles in lava after a volcanic eruption , or even animal burrows . Over time , the external wall of the cavity hardens , and dissolved silicates and/or calcites are deposited on the inside surface . Over time , this slow feed of minerals allows crystals to form inside the hollow chamber . Then , over millions of years , the geode makes its way back to the surface through normal geologic processes.Follow the link for more information.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geode",0

How come the Cro Magnons ; the ancestors of Homo Sapiens had larger cranial capacities than us ? I have read that they were more intelligent then us.Why is this exception in the evolutionary trends ? Probably they had taken a lot more meat than us . Eating meat does grow your brain . Predators do have bigger brains than preys.Their brains are bigger because of the need to calculate the risk and to overtake the preys . Cro Magnons had bigger cranial capacities could have been because they desperately need food especially meat to survive the weather . Their physiques had to adapt the condition and made them tacticians.Cro Magnons maybe were smarter than us in surviving the harsh condition of the world bare-handed but I think that they they were no smarter than us in using tools or making great tools . It 's like native humans or jungle people or whoever who lives in the wilderness who can bear harsh environment bare-handed compared to us living in cities with great facilities but lack experience in handling harsh conditions bare-handed .,0

"Is there anyone who is an active `` swinger '' or who has advice on the subject ? I do n't know how I would feel sharing my wife with another guy , however , I would love to involve her in swinging . if you are an active swinger or just like sex , please reply . If you want to do this with her , lay out the ground rules in advance , get involved in a local swinger 's group , and realize that if she enjoys sex with somebody else , the odds of her leaving you are much , much higher if you swing because you are allowing her to 'shop around ' , so to speak . Most likely you want to do this so you can have sex with other women and are n't thinking about how jealous you could be if you see your wife enjoying sex with somebody else instead of you . She might also realize how unsatisfied she is by you and your marriage will suffer , especially when the other guy is much more experienced with pleasuring a woman and gives her orgasm after orgasm . Your odds of picking up various STDs will also increase . Remember that a condom will not protect against all of them , such as genital warts , and you could both end up unlucky recipients of STDs that you 'll carry the rest of your lives .

"what 's ur idea about iran and NUCLEUS energy ? The idea to contain nuclear proliferation is to have as few countries as possible have atomic weapons . On the other hand any country can use nuclear energy for electric production . A number of countries will assist other countries in constructing a peace nuclear energy plant.The problem occurs when a country wants to develop their own nuclear industry , purportedly for peaceful purposes and their government is not stable and their plans for such development are clearly for weapons development . Iran falls into this latter category.Russia has offered to develop for them ( on Russian soil ) the nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes and Iran has turned this down . They want nuclear weapons and they already have the missile systems which deliver them at least as far as Europe . They support the destruction of Israel and it is a surety that if they had such weapons they would use them.They will be helped to have atomic energy plants for peaceful purposes , they will not be allowed to have an atomic weapons development program . .",0

"To Christians- Who created God ? If God created man , animals , and everything else , then who created God ? I believe that is the same type of question as where did the matter in the big bang theory come from ? In accordance with the physical laws of this universe , it is impossible for the matter in the big bang theory to have come out of nothing or to have just always existed . It is impossible for something to come out of nothing ... I 'm sure you agree with this . Also , the universe is expanding , which indicates that it had a beginning point in time . So you 're question appears to be , `` If it is impossible for the earth to have always been in existance , how is it logical to believe that God has always been in existance ? `` The thing is , we know that the earth had a beginning and that it is impossible for it to have just come about on its own by the physical laws of this world . But if God created everything ( which I believe He did ) , then He is not bound by the laws He created . He made up the laws of physics . How could He be limited to those laws ? We can not think of God in terms of our physical world . God made up the rules , therefore God is not under the rules . He is eternal . The world which He created is not . Here 's another thought I 'm just going to throw out here , even though it does not go right along with your original question . If you believe that you have a soul or a spirit , or if you believe in any type of spirit beings , how could these have come about by purely by physical means ? Can spiritual things come from physical things ? If this world only came about by matter and not by God , how could matter produce spiritual things ? `` For by Him [ Jesus ] all things were created : things in heaven and on earth , visible and invisble , whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities ; all things were created by Him and for Him . He is before all things , and in Him all things hold together . '' Colossians 1:16-17 ( [ Jesus ] was added by me for clarification of the pronoun Him . )",0

I 'm wondering if the Sodium has anything to do with Cholesterol.I also would like to know more about specific foods that are good to control and lover Cholesterol level ( like fish , chicken etc.. and how much I could eat of these healtier ones . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Soluble fiber is very good at lowering cholesterol as it binds the bile ( a digestive agent ) & causes you to excrete it . The body makes more bile ( to replace that which was lost - if it was n't lost , the body tends to recycle bile ) from cholesterol . You 'll find soluble fiber in foods such as apples , oranges & oatmeal . Insoluble fiber is also good for your heart , so eat high fiber foods like beans & veggies . Sodium does not affect your cholesterol level , but it can affect heart health so it 's best to keep it to a minimum . A little exercize , such as walking for 30 minutes 3 times a week , will also work wonders .

"Why ca n't conservatives really learn to conserve more ? seems most conservatives are only interested in conserving a wasteful greedy life-style ... If you are talking about conserving energy - this will not solve the energy problem . It 's only part of the solution . What really solves the problem is drilling and refining our own sources of energy off of our coasts and in ANWR - but that wo n't happen because tree hugging pus*y liberals like yourself would rather block domestic energy production and then whine about gas prices being too high . That 's why there has n't been an oil refinery built in this country for over 30 years . That 's why they have brownouts in California . All because of the environmental movement and their hatred of Capitalism . Raising the supply of energy is a sure fire way to make sure we never run out.This is true of ANY commodity . Let 's take Coca Cola for example . The reason a 12oz can of Coke only costs 75 cents from a vending machine is because that is the price that the market will bear . Now , close every Coca-Cola bottling plant in the country except one and keep the same amount of vending machines - what do you think would happen to the price ? It would skyrocket because there would n't be enough Coke to fill the vending machine demand.On the other hand , if you openend up Coca-Cola bottling plants on every steet corner in America - there would be so much Coke available that the price would plummet because they would have more Coca-Cola than vending machines to dispense them.The same would be true whether you are talking about energy , Coca-Cola , steel , guns , butter or newspapers.Instead of spouting off from your a $ $ , maybe you should learn some Economic facts first .",0

"In politics what does The Right & The Left mean ( what connection to Democrats/Republicans ) ? The left and right ends of the political spectrum discribe people 's basic philosopy of government . Most people think of Democrats of being left center and liberals comfortably in the left and Socialists at the extreme left . On the right side , Republicans would be near the center , Conservatives comfortable in the right and libetarians at the far right.The right tends to favor policies in which the role of the government is extremely limited , especially when it comes to promoting the general welfare of the populous , but at the same time spending adequate resouces for the common defense of the nation such as the military and the enforcement of international trade agreements . Some issues that the Right traditionally cares about are : * Minimize Taxes* Minimize Social Welfare Programs ( Social Security , Medicaid , Medicare ) * Minimize Regulations on Business and Individuals* Elimination of Wealth Redistribution policies such as Progressive Taxation , Asset Based Taxation , and Taxation on Income gained through investment or inheritance . * Minimize ability of citizens to sue the government or corporations , or other individuals based on laws designed to protect the environment , consumers , workers , women , minorities , etc ... .Recently , the Right has embraced other non traditional issues such as : * Increased government regulation of Abortion* Increased government regulation of End of Life decisions* Increased government regulation of Drug Usage* Increased Government funding of Christian religious groups , symbols and priorities . * Increased Government regulation of sexual pratices , indecent speech , homosexuality and unpatriotic behavior . * Decreased regulation of weapon ownership . * Support for public execution of certain criminals . * Reduction of constitutional gaurantees for accused criminals ( Victims Rights ) The left tends to favor a stronger government with policies which benefit the general population at the expense of those in positions of power . People on the left tend to believe that the government 's primary function is to provide for the general welfare of its citizens paid for by taxing the populous . Some issues that the left traditionally cares about are : * Generous funding of Social Programs ( Social Security , Medicaid , Medicare ) * A progressive tax system which taxes wealthy individuals at a higher rate and taxes income earned by means other than work ( Profits , Investment , Inheritence ) higher than work income . * Increased government regulation of employers , polluters , manufacturers , and individuals in the interests of protecting the populous* Protecting Certain Freedoms such as freedom of speech , freedom of the press , right to privacy , voting rights , rights of the accused , etc ... .Recently , the Left has embraced other non traditional issues such as : * Legalization of Abortion* Affirmative Action* Increased regulation of weapon Ownership* Less strict Immigration laws* Opposition of certain wars* Separation of Church and State",0

"It what ways does the west coast differ from the east ? I am thinkin about moving west but everybodys always saying how its like a whole nother country . I have been to California and also lived on the east coast and the mid-west . From my experience , I found the west coast to be a totally different country . But there are some pros and cons . There is a lot of mixing of cultures there , so you will find whites , Hispanics , and people of Indian and Asian descent in large numbers . The west coast is also warmer climate-wise due to the proximity to the desert and the sea . More importantly , for some reason I found the people friendlier than anywhere else in the states . The food is also inspired by different cultures , but you can find a lot of authentic Mexican food there . One word of caution , the west coast is pretty expensive to stay ! On the other hand , the percentage of young population ( and techies ) is very high , so you will find someone for outdoor activites pretty easily .",0
"What are the pros and cons of Nuclear thermal propulsion ? Is it feasible to use it in a manned mission to moon ? How is it better than nuclear electric propulsion ? What will be its harmful effects ? Will it violate the NTBT ? Project Orion was an idea in the 1960s to use nuclear explosions to push a space ship around the solar system . The idea was to use a lot of small explosions in succession to create the sort of effect one gets with a continious burn from the usual chemical fueled rockets.There were some small scale tests done with non-nuclear nukes , which suggested the concept was n't crazy , but there was never any full scale tests , and certainly nothing using fission bombs.It is not clear that scaling this concept up to the size needed for a manned rocket would be that feasible , although some disagree with that assesment . There would be a tremendous stress on the vehicle from all these explosions , especially if they were more contained ( in order to harness more of the explosive power for thrust ) .But , I do n't think we 'll ever see anything like this unless there is some sort of mass evacuation of the planet . ( Not there is anywhere to go . ) As you might expect , a Project Orion rocket is essentially the same as a huge number of atmospheric atomic explosions . Not exactly enviro-friendly , to say the least.IF by `` nuclear thermal '' propulsion you mean the generators used by some space probes to generate electricity , then these are far to weak for a manned vehicle . They could n't supply the power to lift off from Earth , and a trip to the moon using an electric ion drive takes much , much longer than the more direct chemically driven Apollo trajectory . Ion propulsion has tried on the space probe Deep Space 1 , although this was not nuclear powered .",0

hair products and skin prouducts ? wat r the best hair products 2 use 2 get my hair thick again its already long and wat about skin i have some littelblack dots from bumps and i need them 2 go way and dont like proactive As far as skin goes : Try the Mary Kay skin care line with customized skin care products for acne . The best thing to with your skin is always to keep it clean as well as treating breakouts . This helps prevent breakouts . There are five steps to basic skin care : 1 . Cleanse2 . Exfoliate3 . Tone/Freshen4 . Moisturize5 . ProtectThe Mary Kay 3 in 1 cleanser can do the first three steps in one . The fifth step is protect . You want to use an oil free foundation which our formulas for dry normal combo and oily skin are all oil free . When your skin is protected with foundation you can wash off the impurities that your skin catches in the air . The foundation catches the irritants and impurities instead of them getting into your pores causing further breakouts . Mary Kay is satisfaction guaranteed . So if you try it and it doesnt work for you you can get different products or your money back . Also it is so important that when you are using skin care you use one line be it Mary Kay or Avon or a Walmart brand . They are formulated to work with one another . Mixing products not designed to work together can cause reactions in some people . ; ) To even out skin tone you of course need to keep your skin exfoliated but also use a solution like our day and night solution . The day solution has SPF 25 in it and the Night Solution has Vitamin A and E and more in them . These collagen inducing products help to tighten and firm the skin as well as even out tone . You can add in our Microdermabrasion once or twice a week to totally exfoliate and remove dead skin . The second step of our microderm set will return your skin to its proper PH balance so you will not be rough or dry afterwards . I reccomend using products as follows but all skin care must be customized for an individual.Timewise 3 in 1 Cleanser ( customized for skin type ) Timewise Day Solution ( at night use Night Solution ) Timewise Moisturizer ( customized for skin type ) Timewise Firming Eye creamAdditional moisturizers if needed ( intense for dry spots etc ) Foundation ( customized for skin type and shade ) Color products ( use all oil free and non-comedogenic ) Hope this was helpful ! !

"Respiratory Therapy -- can you tell me what the job is like ? I 'm wanting to go back to school for Respiratory Therapy , but would like some input into what the job is like . I have been a registered respiratory therapist for 17 years now . The job can be very stressful depending on which type of facility that you work in . You must have a strong stomach because some of the things that we do can be quite disgusting ; such as tracheostomy care and suctioning sputum . The job can also be extremely tiring physically because of all the standing and walking within the hospital . The nursing field pays a little better .

"has does alcohol and bipolar disorder effect each other ? Yes.If a person is taking medication for a bi-polar ailment , then the effects of alcohol can not be adequately surmised on the behavioral aspects of the person in question . It can lead into manic highs or lows , or just disassociate that individual from reality.If the person is not on medications , it can do the same . However , more vividly and progressively animated . Alcohol , being a depressant , usually has the affect on this type of individual as making them reach their `` lows '' , and they can be quite violent and destructive.Anyone with bi-polar disease should ALWAYS be careful on ANY medications injested . This comes from some aspirins containing stimulants , cough syrup ( hypertension effect ) , etc.Anyone on Zoloft , Paxil , or any other seratonin reuptake meds are advised strongly to avoid alcohol.Consult with a physician on this matter -- do n't waste time on the 'net !",0

"which are better ... sit ups or crunches ? Traditional sit-ups emphasize sitting up rather than merely pulling your sternum down to meet your pelvis . The psoas muscles run from the lower back to the front of the thighs . This muscle action is to pull the thighs closer to the torso.This action is the major component of sitting up . Because of this , when you are doing sit ups your psoas muscles are the primary muscles being engaged and not your abdominal exercises . So sit-ups are a pretty useless exercise if you want to get your abs in shape . Instead , use crunches , because they directly work your abs .",0

"If the Google people are supposed to be so smart , how come so many of their recent UIs are lame ? Google reader is pretty bad . Google desktop is clunky ( although a good idea in theory ) . Google groups is lame . Heck even their Google Answers sucks in comparison to this Yahoo Answers site.In addition , it seems to me that yahoo , ask.com and some others are innovating more on search results . For example , enter in a name of a sports team ( in season ) on different search engines and you 'll see a good example of what I mean.Do they have too many programmers/engineers and not enough true , touchy/feely UI designers ? Does Google plan to just live off their brand now ? Concerned Google stockholder . In my opinion , Google was never something more than a great search engine . In an early era where dial-up was more common than broadband , Google built a top-notch engine with a very light UI which made it an immediate favorite amongst a lot of users . What was nice about Google was that it never aspired to be something someone else was , it created its own identity as a very comprehensive search engine . However , offlate , I have started losing faith in Google , especially because their objectives and goals as a company seem very unclear . A chunk of their revenue still comes through ads , and their search engine is really the only intellectual property they have developed from the ground-up , otherwise everything else is either just an acquisition or a bad idea . Google earth was previously keynote , Google Talk has been built upon Jabber which is an open source technology for messaging and these were the `` other '' great ideas besides the search engine , but things like web accelerators and secure connection through VPN are just lame excuses to drive internet traffic through their servers.Another great idea from Google was desktop search , but somehow they never capitalized on the idea , and today MSN has come out tops in this department.At the end of the day , Google isnt running out of ideas , I think they are running out of focus , something that companies like Yahoo have and very well defined ones at that .",0

Baby teeth that are extracted by the Dr. were done for a reason , this can be decay or overcrowding , or permanent teeth were coming in and the baby ones were not lost yet.Some children do not wiggle the baby teeth and we have to remove them when the new ones are ready to erupt , if this is so , then your child may just be late in geeting their teeth.It is usually not something to be concerned with , especially if your child has regular dental care with a Pediatric dentist .",0

"what is day saving time ? Daylight Saving Time ( or Summer Time as it is called in many countries ) is a way of getting more out of the summer days by advancing the clocks by one hour during the summer . Then , the sun will appear to rise one hour later in the morning when people are usually asleep anyway , at the benefit of one hour longer evenings when awake : The sunset and sunrise are one hour later than during normal time . DST could save energy ( less artificial light is needed during the evening ) and make the country more efficient in addition to the pleasing effect of lighter evenings . To make DST work , the clocks have to be adjusted one hour ahead when DST begins ( during spring ) , and adjusted back one hour to standard time every autumn . There are many countries observing DST , and many who do not . Benjamin Franklin suggested the method in 1784 , but it was first during World War I , in 1916 in several counties in Europe that DST was adopted , although it was proposed several times before , but rejected .",0

"How does the free market environment encourage the economic and socioeconomic goals sought by society ? Free markets economy is an addendum to the laws of nature . Water flows from high to low till equilized . There is no good or bad about it - it just is . The good is - lower parts can get water , the bad part is that water may cause attrition or floods along the way , or simply be wasted in the lower areas . But movement of resources from resource rich to rosurce poor countries/areas follows the same principle . Survival of the fittest is another way of looking at it . In the resourse hungry countries , people will do anything to survive , including accepting low paid jobs . In the resource rich countries , people are at a higher level of Maslow 's triangle , are more complacent and demanding of higher standards of living . This creates a cycle of abundance and deprivation in various areas of the world - thus a boom is always followed by a boom and vice versa.The overall socio-economic goals of a society include equality for all . Free markets are one way of redistributing wealth and adhering to the supply and demand principles . Culture of consumerism necessitates maximizing affordability - so production has to be at the lowest price . If the demand of the same job is high elsewhere , then thats where the jobs will go.Most issues associated with concept of free economy are detrimental to the wellbeing of vulnerable population . Patent issues cause hundreds of thousand deaths/suicides in India and Africa . It amplifies the divide between the rich and the poor . WHO , GATT , JAFAA and NAFTAA are weapons used to coerce governments of small countries . Instead of waging war and occupying countries , the US uses trade economics to control and occupy countries . So Free Trade has really become an intrument of war rather than the instrument of social justice that it was supposed to be.I guess the free economy is a concept - and just like any other concept it has its good and bad . Often the media portrays only one side of the issue - depending on where you live you get to hear one side of the story .",0

The difference between yellow gold or white gold ( or silver ) is colour . There is not too much difference between white gold , silver , or platinum for that matter . It all comes down to price and prestige . The more you spend , the easier to show off with pride.Of course , the best place to start is in her own jewellery collection .

"Is there such thing as a 'Dixie-crat ' anymore ? Is there a public figure who you would consider to be one ? DixieCrat was n't just a term meaning southern conservative Democrat , it was a real party ( it 's official name was the `` State 's Rights party '' ) formed as a 3rd party in 1948 , with Strom Thurmond as it 's presidential candidate . ( here was their official platform in 1948 , including segregation- http : //www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/dixiecrat1.html ) it pretty much fell apart after the 1948 election.Basically , a dixiecrat is a person that stands by the old line democrat platform of segregationist policies ( the Democrats used to be the conservative party , and the Republican party was the progressive party- this started to change between the election cycles of 1932 and 1940 with FDR ) - the dixiecrats were formed in response to Truman 's integration of the armed services and the overall democrat civil rights plank.Basically in answer to your question , no there really are n't any people around anymore that believe in the Democratic party but are against it 's policies . Even `` yellow dog '' Democrats are no longer the type of people that support the party without supporting it 's causes . The death knell for the dixiecrats was when Thurmond switched over to the Republican party ... the rest fell in line behind him like dominos .",0
"Where do Muslims and Buddists stand on abortion ? bismillahir rahmanir raheem . I will answer this to the best of my ability and knowledge and Allah knows best . First of all , pre Islamic Arabs did not kill ALL of the girl infants otherwise there would have been no more Arabs . But female infanticide did exist and was generally an economic concern more than anything , and had nothing to do with `` bad omens '' , it says in the Quran `` Kill not your children for fear of want '' . Prophet Muhammad ( SAW ) put an end to that practice of female infanticide . But to answer your question , there is no concensus today amongst learned people , male and female but the predominant opinion is that Abortion is not allowed unless a physician says it is necessary to save the life of the mother . This is because our lives and bodies are not our own . They are gifts to us from our creator and only our creator has the right to take them away . But while we have them they are in our care and we are responsible for that . For instance , smoking has been shown to be harmful and the concensus opinion is that it is not allowed because of that . Taking a human life is the ultimate action in this way and it includes the taking of the human life that is growing in the mother 's womb . Children also are considered to be a gift from Allah ( SWT ) and we are not allowed to kill them before or after they leave the mother 's womb . A second , minority opinion , says that since the soul does not enter the body until 40 days after conception therefore abortion is legal for the first 40 days . This opinion is an extreme minority.Salim",0
"whats the best small business to open ? In my opinion , and experience , the best small business to launch is an online business . Create websites about topics of internest to you , then put on PPC ads from servers like Yahoo Publishers Network or Adsense . You will be paid for each click , when visitors come to the site , see ads of interest to them , and click the ads . The best things about this business is the initial investment is very low . You have no inventory to stock , no orders to fill , no customers to contend with , no shoplifting , no breakage , no back breaking boxes to lift , no employees to hire , no rush hour traffic , and no credit card fraud . You are looking at monthly hosting fees of $ 20 or less , you design in , so there is no design fee . We are making over $ 4000 a month just in the PPC revenue , plus we sell ads to other business directly .

"Why ca n't we get an acceptable Communications Decency Act and Child Pornography Prevention Act ? First Amendment jurisprduence tightly restricts Congress from enacting such regulations . The Supreme Court has articulated a test in a case called Miller , which states that obscenity is unprotected , but requires it to meet three qualifications : First , the average person , applying community standards , considering the work as a whole , finds that the work appeals to the prurient interest ; second , the work is a patently offensive depiction , applying community standards , of sexual conduct , as defined specifically by law ; and third , as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . That 's a lot of burdens for Congress to reach , and it often includes too much protected speech when trying to identify obscenity.The Court allowed restrictions on child pornography , too , in Ferber , so long as the work , first , visually depicts minors , who , second , are engaged in sexual acts lewdly exhibiting their genitals . The Court later interpreted this prohibition as only concerned with the well-being of children in the creation of pornography , not the fostering of child molesters , and so virtual child pornography was found protected , so long as no children were actually harmed.It seems like the Supreme Court is currently protecting a lot under the First Amendment , even things that seems pretty dangerous or pretty valueless . Congress will have its work cut out to try to pass better regulations that can pass the Court 's scrutiny .",0

Low rung food chain heterotrophs eat autotrophs ( these are herbivores ) and get their calories ( food is a source of chemical potential energy ) from the glucose ( and some other chemicals ) made by autotrophs . Higher level heterotrophs eat the lower level heterotrophs , getting their calories from proteins and fats of the herbivores they are eating . The calories contained in the proteins and fats of the herbivores is derived from the calories of the autotrophs .

How common is it for it to shift up and actually pierce thru the skin ? Does this happen often in the mediacl industry , in humans or animals ? What could have caused it ? It can . Some procedures ( with humans ) require either external braces that are acually attatched to the bone via pins and screws . Some are temporary screws that are left sticking out of the bone that eventually may protrude through the skin . The doctors do n't make them flush with the surface of the bone because that makes it easier to remove them . However , the inside of bones is sterile .

"Will unfounded domestic violence charge hold up in court in Va ? My husband and I were arguing in our apartment and the neighbors called the police . We were alreay in the process of `` making up '' . The police came and interviewed him and visualy saw marks on me from the `` making up '' . The police arrested him for domestic violence and said that the state of Virginia would charge him for it not the city . They never took a statement from me nor pictures . From the time my husband got arrested to his release back to me took 45 min . He litterly walked in the back door did some paperwork and walked out the front.What are the odds that he will be found guilty with only the testamony of the officer and me testifying and telling my story in defense of my husband in the state of Va. You know , I suspect you 're not going to get many takers on this one . You 've got a lot of issues here that are very involved and nobody who knows what they are talking about is going to be able to give you an answer based on the `` facts '' you 've presented here.Rather than try to answer your question , let me ask you some more : What do you define as arguing ? Was it strictly verbal or was there any physical touching whatsoever ? Were any threats of any kind made during the argument ? You said the police saw marks on you from `` making up '' ... which , frankly , is very suspicious to an old cop like me . But the question is , what kind of marks ? Are you talking about a hickey or a bruise ? When the police interviewed your husband , what did he say ? Did he perhaps admit to doing something that would have violated the law in your state ? And please - if you did not personally hear the interview between your husband and the police , you do not *know* what was said ... you might know what your husband told you later , but if you did n't hear it for yourself , you do n't know.Do n't know if you 're asking a question about the city or the state prosecuting , but if you are : not unusual for the state to prosecute a domestic violence charge , even if the victim denies it or changes their story later.If you told the police the marks on you were from `` making up '' , then they did take a statement from you . Once you said that , the police may have felt that was all the statement they were going to get out of you - especially if the marks they saw were not consistent with what you said was `` making up '' ( for example : most people do n't make up by leaving bruises , swollen lips , scratches , black eyes , etc ... if those are the marks you 're talking about , I 'm with the cops on this one ) .If you had marks , the police certainly should have taken photos of them . Some types of minor injuries do n't show well in photos ( especially depending on the equipment ) so they may not have thought photos were worthwhile or they just simply did n't take them . What were your `` marks '' ? You 're asking what the odds are that he 'll be found guilty based on what you say is the officer 's testimony and your statement in defense of your husband . Ca n't answer that one because neither you nor I have all the facts , I suspect.What did the neighbors say ( or more importantly , do the neighbors have something to say ; did they hear threats , did they hear physical violence , did they hear you say something that would suggest you were being victimized ) ? What did he say ? Maybe without meaning to , he admitted to a crime . He would n't be the first person to do so ... and if the cops were skillful interviewers , they may have obtained an admission or confession from him without him realizing he was doing so.What is the crime of domestic violence in Virginia ? You were smart to include that you 're in that state because it certainly makes a difference ( and unfortunately , I 'm not from there ) .Do the police know you and your husband ? Either of you been arrested for domestic violence before ? Bottom line : way too many `` what-if 's '' for anyone to give you an educated answer to your question . Depending on the answers to the questions I 've asked , the chances of him being found guilty could be very good , or very poor.And finally : I 've investigated domestic violence crimes for over 18 years as a police officer . I hope everything you wrote here is absolutely true ... that you were not the victim of domestic violence , and that you are as safe today as the day you were born . I hope nobody ever lays a hand on you , threatens you , or abuses you . However , what you 've written here ( and what I suspect your answers to some of my questions might be ) is some of the most commonly-expressed statements I 've heard from domestic violence vi",0

Hi how can I connect my printer to both of my computers where it will print from either one without me having to unplug it and set ip up everytime on the computer I wish to print . That would depend on what kind of connector ( s ) your printer has : if it has a parallel/Centronics connector , there are parallel switches which would do the trick . If it has a network/Ethernet connection , a router or hub or switch ( depending on your network setup ) would be the easiest - if you have one of those three already , you would connect the printers network cable to the router or hub or switch and then should be able to set it up on both computers through Windows printer sharing . If it has a USB connector , I 'm not sure if you can share a printer through a USB hub , but there are USB-to-Ethernet adapters that might also work in conjunction with a router or hub or switch .",0

"am i at risk for std ? Hi , I have a concern and I was hoping that some of you might be able to help me . Last night my girlfriend came over to my house and we had unprotected vaginal sex .

We didnt perform any oral sex though last night but we have in the past few weeks . I just wanted to know , if it 's possible that I caught anything ( even though she was a virgin ) . STD or HIV ? one last note : A girl performed oral sex on me last december ( early december ) . Does that influence anything ? Thank you in advance If your girl is a virgin and she has not been infected by any STD by sharing needles or bad blood transfusion you 're not going to catch anything from her.You can receive an STD by Salival transmission so if the girl who went down on you has an STD you may have received it.Remember that life is an STD . If you 're having unprotected vaginal sex you need to make sure you are at a point in your life where you 'll be able to support a child . If you 're not then you should take every precaution against pregnancy . Remember that the only method that is 100 % effective is abstinence ( well and oral I guess ) .",0

"why are banks for coins called piggy banks ? In Middle English , `` pygg '' referred to a type of clay used for making various household objects such as jars . People often saved money in kitchen pots and jars made of pygg , called `` pygg jars '' . By the 18th Century , the spelling of `` pygg '' had changed and the term `` pygg jar '' had evolved to `` pig bank . '' This name may have caught on because the pig banks were mostly used by children , and the pig is a child-friendly shape that is easy to fashion out of clay . The actual origin of the name bears no relation to the pig itself.What also helped to start the change from jar to pig was during the 18th century , an order of 200 `` pygg '' jars was sent for by a shop owner . The person on the receiving end of this letter did not understand and hand crafted 200 coin holders that were shaped like pigs . When this order was received they were shelved and sold very quickly . The new pig shaped coin holder became popular . Once the shop had run out of stock , they sent off for more pig-shaped coin holders .",0

When thedetectives went to their home to ask them where they were on the night ofthe murder , they said they were home with their mother and their motherconfirmed this . It turned out that she was lying and so covering up for them . Was this a sin or is it reasonable for a mother to lie for her children - a white lie possibly ? Even though lieing is wrong but also I would n't blame the mother because a good mother will do anything to protect her baby no matter how old their child or children are .",0

"Why do the Pittsburg Steelers only have their symbol on 1 side of their helmets and what does it represent ? The Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 , and is based on the old U.S. Steel logo . It consists of the word `` Steelers '' surrounded by three astroids ( hypocycloids of four cusps ) . The yellow hypocycloid represents coal , the red one is for ore , and the blue one represents steel scrap.The team 's colors are black and gold , with their helmet being solid black with a gold central stripe and small white uniform numbers on the forehead . The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts their logo on only one side of the helmet ( the right side ) . At first , it was a test to see how the logo appeared on their helmets , but its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently .",0
"Why US try to develop a democratic power in IRAQ when they will never be a democratic nation ? Who is to say that IRAQ will not be a democratic nation . Even the USSR was democratic in the truest sense and meaning of the word , the people could vote , problem was there was only one person they could vote for.Oil has NOTHING to do with the war in IRAQ . I wo n't even get into why but the war would be in Saudi Arabia where the oil reserves are over twice the size of Iraq.We need to look back in history to see what has happened and the future looks bright for IRAQ . Success in Central America , Liberia , Korea , the new Russia , the slavic regions , and others have formed some type of democracy.The `` democracy '' that other countries enjoy are definately not the same as ours , but even a Monarchy like Morocco has a democratic government.Success in IRAQ will indeed depend on whether democracy becomes the new form of government when America finally does pull out or if there will be political chaos and insergency.Time will only tell.To correct a couple of the other writers above me ... The United States is NOT a democratic country , it is a Federal Republic . If indeed we were a true democracy Gore would be president not George Bush ( Gore won more of the popular vote but less of the electoral vote ) . So to say the US is the most democratic country in the world is absurd . Correct me if I am wrong but there is no country in the world that is truely democratic .",0
"How does a Sonicare toothbrush charge with no metal connection points ? How do electrons pass through the plastic in the handle to charge the batteries inside ? I 'm sure it has to do with magnets or something , but I would like spacifics . You are on the right track . It relies on inductive charging : < quote > If you own an electric toothbrush , there 's a good chance that it has a completely sealed toothbrush unit . The toothbrush rests on the charger without any metal contacts to connect the toothbrush to the base . This has the great advantage of allowing the toothbrush to be completely sealed so that water can not enter through exposed contacts . It also avoids any problems with water getting into the contacts and shorting out the charger.This sort of sealed arrangement is called inductive charging . Essentially , the toothbrush and the base form a two-part transformer , with the base having one part of the transformer and the toothbrush having the other . When you slide the toothbrush onto the base , the complete transformer is created and charge can flow.The base contains one of the coils and the metal bar . The toothbrush contains the second coil . When you drop the toothbrush onto the base , you create the complete transformer ! < /quote >",0
"Where is the city of Shirvan ? Shervan or Shirvan was a former Persian province in Caucasus , a state ruled by the Shervanshahs and the birthplace of the Persian poet Khaqani . Shervan was ceceded from Iran by the Gulistan Treaty of 1813 and was annexed to Russia . It is now part of the Republic of Azerbaijan.As is the case with many city and village names in large countries , there is often more than one city or village with the same name in different parts of Iran .

"i need to know what plants mean for a school project. ? example : laurel wreaths symbolize victory . i need an answer soon ! ASAP ! ! ! Need an answer for your project before monday ? Its not a good idea to leave stuff like that for the last minute.Flowers have been irresitible to painters through the ages .

The meaning associated with a specific flower differs between cultures ; the symbolism for each given here is from Western European culture unless specified otherwise.Bamboo : A symbol for longevity ( it 's always got green shoots ) as well as strength and grace ( it bends readily but does n't break easily ) . In Chinese philosophy the straight stem of bamboo symbolises the path towards enlightment , the segments of the stem being the steps along the way.Carnation : A symbol of betrothal or engagement . In China , a carnation is a symbol of marriage.Chrysanthemum : The national symbol of Japan , 'mums are a symbol for long life.Clover leaf : The three divided leaves of clover ( also known as shamrock or wood sorrel ) represent the Christian Holy Trinity of God the Father , Christ the Son , and the Holy Spirit.Kabbalah SymbolsGreat deals on Kabbalah Symbols The national symbol of Ireland and of Ireland 's patron saint , St Patrick ( his feast day is 17 March ) .

Also of generosity.Iris : Associated with death as Iris was a Greek goddess of the rainbow , which she used to travel down to earth with messages from the gods and to transport women 's souls to the underworld . The three upright petals and three drooping sepals are symbols for faith , valour , and wisdom.Jasmine : This strongly scented , white flower is used as a Hindu symbol for love.Lily : Symbolises purity , chastity , and innocence . White lilies represent the purity of the Virgin Mary .

Also a symbol for fertility , creation , and purity . The long stem symbolises our connection to our origins , while the flower represents the enlightenment to which we aspire.Mistletoe : Standing under the mistletoe at Christmas gives anyone the opportunity to kiss you.Orchid : A symbol of perfection .

Very good question Yellow , but only you can answer that question for yourself as the question is ultimately about you . In your question I hear a self-judgment that you are unconstructive with your time . This means that you judge yourself to waste time , or that your time is not valuable since you are doing `` non-constructive '' tasks with it . Perhaps you are a workaholic and resent your coworkers who are spending time on Yahoo ! ANSWERS instead of helping you get the `` important '' things done . Or perhaps it is hard for you to be vulnerable or share your feelings , hence the irony of your question . Either way , it is a good question and a wonderful opportunity for self-knowledge .

"Where are my virgins at ? Anyone choosing not to have sex these days ? Any thoughts ? Well I am a 17 year old abstinent girl , and there are n't many people out there choosing not to have sex . Where did all the virgins go ? ? What are your thoughts on being abstinent ? Hi there , I know that the pressure of being a virgin is extremely hard for one to handle , especially in the Western societies that we live in ; but virginity is worth striking for . I 'm in my 20s and the group of friends that I have is also in their 20s and we are all virgins . I think the most important thing that one needs to keep in mind is that virginity is for ONESELF , not for anyone else ( or sometimes you might wan na save it for you future husband ) . Once you are determined about it , it would be less difficult when you think of whether to have sex or not . My friends and I choose not to have sex before marriage b/c we see SEX as LOVE , and we respect our body as well as our partners ' .

"Buddhist Center in northern Jersey ? I 'm very interesting in practicing Buddhism with a mentor .

I am right across the river from NYC , and while there is a center on 5th ave. , I ca n't afford the fare to get there and back very often . Are there centers which offer free classes or lectures or guided meditation in northern jersey ? I would highly recommend a 10-day vipassana meditation course ( http : //www.dhamma.org/vipassan.htm ... ) if you can get the time off . I think it 's definitely worth it , so keep it in mind.It 's very intense , over 10 hours of meditation a day for 10 days , complete silence ( except with the teachers ) , and guidance instructions basically broken up into hour-chunks . It might seem intimidating but it 's very doable and you just need to have the intention to do it.Also it 's non-sectarian , anyone can practice it , and it 's free from any dogma , blind belief , etc.Also ( again ) the courses are free , by donation only , and no recommended or forced donation . Even the room and board are provided , because past students have found it to be beneficial so it 's supported entirely by donation.Very intense but since it 's so rigorous most people see distinct benefits after only 10 days .",0

"Is it legal for an employer to dock 30 minutes from your pay for being 1 minute late ? It depends on the state you live in , but most places it would be . You usually have to be paid for all the time you work . He could make you not work for 30 minutes , but if you actually work the 30 minutes , you need to be paid . If you tell us what your state , I could give a more detailed answer.Edit : It is definitely illegal . First , Nevada law says , `` An employer shall pay to the employee wages for each hour the employee works . '' Further , it is illegal to `` Pay a lower wage , salary or compensation to an employee than the amount earned by the employee when the work was performed . '' An employer can change the rate you are paid as a way to punish you , but that requires that they notify you in writing `` Not less than 7 days before the employee performs any work at the decreased wage , salary or compensation . '' Finally , the employer can withold amounts for certain reasons like health insurance and such , but for any other reason , the employee has to voluntarily authorize the deduction in writing . Tell your boss all of this and ask for your back wages in writing . If he refuses , talk to a lawyer.Edit2 : I forgot to add that the regulations specifically say `` An employer may not use a blanket authorization that was made in advance by the employee to withhold any amount from the wages due the employee . '' The employee has to sign the authorization each time .",0

"What are the problems the No Child Left Behind Act has presented ? The biggest problem is that it makes teachers focus on teaching to a test rather than just teaching . Knowing how to take the test is more important , under this system , than knowing what is on it . Further , the act has been severely underfunded . The act requires more qualified teachers ( aka ones with more education ) , but more education means higher pay , which is something many school districts ca n't do.I think more importantly than any of those problems , there 's the issue of how to measure improvement . Under the act each class is compared to the previous class , meaning this year 's 2nd grade is compared to last year 's 2nd grade . Now , obviously comparing different groups of kids is fundamentally unfair . People do n't like to admit it , but some people have different base levels of intelligence . Certainly everyone who is not developmentally challenged should be able to pass high school reasonably , but to fault a school and its teachers simply because one class is , on average , not quite as smart is the most asinine thing I can think of . Thankfully the DOE is starting a pilot program of comparing student scores across their school careers ( comparing last year 's 2nd grade scores to this year 's 3rd grade scores ) . That is obviously the better way to do it , but making the switch is going to cost money , something the act has failed to provide .",0

Not until after 2 should you really start following label directions without a doctor 's advice.So my advice would be make an appointment with her pediatrician for as early as you can today.Other than that keep her warm but not over bundled . Use layers . Offer her lots of liquids , extra juice and water . Run a humidifier if you can .",0

"Why was an embargo put on Cuba ? `` When , on January 7 , 1959 , Fidel Castro assumed control of Cuba after President Fulgencio Batista fled on December 31 , the U.S. government initially supported the Cuban Revolution , formally recognizing the new government . However , relations rapidly deteriorated when the new Cuban government passed the first Agrarian Reform Law to begin expropriation of large-scale ( largely American-owned ) land holdings on May 17 , 1959 . The compensation offered ( based on 20-year bonds at 4.5 % interest for the tax-assessed value ) was seen as inadequate , and was rejected by American interests . Animosity escalated with the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis . After that , the U.S. promised never to invade Cuba again , but resorted to financial measures instead . `` This embargo initially caused damage to the Cuban economy , but 45 years later , has very little effect . This is why many ( aside from GW Bush ) have called for lifting the embargo .",0

"How do I raise my credit score fast and without paying some company to erase stuff off my report ? Basic but effective tequniques or tricks if you know them . If someone asks you for money to increase your score , it is true that they are likely to be a thief , however , it is NOT TRUE that you can not raise your score . Your credit score is primarily affected by a few things . First , any time that you make a late payment , even one that is only 30 days late , that will effect your score as much as 50 points the first month . It will climb slowly each month thereafter if you pay on time . So , do n't ever pay late . Secondly , a large part of your score is determined by the ratio of credit used to credit available . If you have a $ 1,000 limit on your card , DO NOT leave a balance on that card of over $ 500 . The lower your credit debt to credit limits , the better your score will be . Lastly , the longer you have credit , the better . Some people will cancel cards and accounts that are infrequently used . Do n't do that ! Leave them open . On the other hand , having too many credit accounts means you are a credit hog . Every time you apply for credit , your score will go down , for a few months .",0

"why some people are gay ? I wish I could say I read Phillips answer , but I could n't maintain focus . So , risking repeating elements of his analysis , I 'm going to give this question a stab , but with a biological/evoluationary bent.Evolutionary arguments have been offered for male homosexuality . For example , Symons ( 1979 ) argues that homosexuality results from a meme that takes advantage of the inborn male propensity to find sexual variety interesting . Normally this propensity would be adaptive because it would encourage males to attempt sexual relations with many women , which would result in more offspring . But a meme could parasitize this propensity , redirecting sexual interest to non-adaptive objects , as in fetishism or homosexuality . Epigenetic arguments have been inspired by work on pre-natal hormones . Dîrner and his colleagues ( cited in LeVay 1994 ) link stress during pregnancy to hormonal effects on the fetus that would lead to homosexuality . This could be part of a mother 's adaptive reproductive strategy . That is , in times of stress , when it is difficult to raise children , it may be adaptive to have some homosexual children who could help their siblings raise offspring instead of having offspring of their own.Memic and epigenetic arguments may explain some aspects of homosexuality , such as the cultural variations in practices or identities , or specific behaviors of homosexuals ( femininity for example ) . However , the biological studies of homosexuality , together with the extraordinary cross-cultural similarities of exclusive homosexuals ( Whitam 1983 ) suggest that some aspects of homosexuality ( e.g . orientation ) are at least partly determined by genes.The basic problem for genetic explanations of homosexuality is to account for how a gene that does not lead to offspring could survive the pressures of natural selection . One possibility is that a maladaptive gene for homosexuality might re-occur repeatedly in a population if it results from the frequent mutation of a gene that is normally adaptive . However , people with maladaptive genes rarely exceed 1 % of the population , while male homosexuality apparently occurs much more frequently ( Whitam and Mathy 1986 ; Gadpaille 1980 ; Diamond 1993 ) . Another possibility is that a recessive gene for homosexuality might have advantages that allow it to pass on to future generations . For example , homosexuals could directly help their relatives ( who share the recessive gene ) raise more children . This `` kin selection '' hypothesis predicts more homosexuality in those societies where homosexuals could most help their relatives ( for example , in endogamous societies where homosexuals would live nearby ) . Nevertheless , cross-cultural research shows that this is not the case ( Werner 1979 ) . Another possibility is that a homosexual gene itself , when combined with non-homosexual genes , may provide reproductive advantages . This latter scenario is sometimes known as the `` heterozygous '' hypothesis , although it is really about any type of gene combination ( LeVay 1994 ; Sommer 1990 ) . The heterozygous argument suggests that homosexuality results from genes for submissive behavior . An animal possessing only submissive genes would fail to reproduce for lack of trying . But an animal possessing only genes for dominance would also fail to reproduce because it would get killed for taking too many risks . It is the `` heterozygous '' males , who would most likely pass on their genes . By the genetic laws of probability , this would leave every generation with a certain percentage of individuals at the extremes . For example , if each of a pair of chromosomes had only one `` homosexual '' locus with only two possible alleles ( one for dominance and one for submissiveness ) this would leave a heterozygous couple with 25 % of their offspring homozygous for submissiveness , 50 % heterozygous , and 25 % homozygous for dominance . If , however , homosexuality were the result of the interaction of five ge",0

Alopecia means baldness , but just as in men , it does not have to be complete hair loss . This is seen as hair thinning predominantly over the top and front of the head . It affects approximately one-third of all susceptible women , but is most commonly seen after menopause Female pattern hair loss may begin as early as puberty . In these cases if there are signs of hormone imbalance , such as excess facial or body hair , a hormone evaluation should be done . Hormonal changes are a common cause of female hair loss . Many women do not realize that hair loss can occur after pregnancy or following discontinuation of birth control pills . It may also follow any sudden physical or psychological stress to the body . These types of hair loss are `` Telogen Effluvium '' and are usually temporary . It is important to remember that this hair loss may be delayed by up to three months following the change . Up to 8 months will be required for regrowth to be fully achieved.Treatment often starts with Rogaine ( topical minoxidil 2 % ) . Rogaine is the only FDA approved medication currently available for female pattern hair loss . The other hair loss medication , Propecia , just does n't work in women at all . Aldactone ( spironolactone ) pills help many women , especially whose hair loss starts before menopause but takes many months . Hormone replacement pills , such as Prempro , plus Aldactone are better after menopause . Experienced hair transplant surgeons can often achieve excellent results in women with the new follicular unit and minigraft techniques . You have to be a qualified candidate and have realistic expectations .",0

"Why do birds not fall out of trees when they sleep ? Because of the way their legs are built.The tendons in bird 's legs are arranged as a pulley-rope system so that the weight of the animal pulls on these tendons and keeps their fingers closed at rest . Thus they do not require voluntary muscle action to maintain their grasp on branches.This is specially characteristic of songbirds . Others may rely on nests , platforms or other types of dwellings",0

If they pain goes below your knee , it is NOT your sciatic nerve ( at least not exclusively ) . That pain will stop at the knee . It could be a different nerve exclusively or a different nerve plus the sciatic nerve . You should try chiropractic or physical therapy , but whatever you do you should try alternative therapies before you consider something so drastic . I do n't know that a doctor would do such a surgery anyway ... more likely cortisone injections . Also , you could still be able to walk , since the nerves that deal with pain and the nerves that deal with motor function ( ie walking ) are actually two separate things . Get evaluated by a qualified professional .",0

"If you were to die tonight , where will you spend eternity ? Every one spends time preparing for their lives here on earth . We focus on making money , which of course we need to pay bills and live with some kind of security . Yet for some , money is all they ever think about- and they become greedy and greediness leads to selfishness and people stop caring about what really matters . We stop caring about how precious life is . How God gave us the air we breathe and the ability to be creative and work towards building relationships with others and with God our creator . When we become greedy we lose out because our whole life is spent grabbing wealth so we can get ahead . Ahead for what ? New house , more cars , more hedonistic pleasures to fulfill the emptiness we really feel inside . The Bible says , `` money is the root of all evil . '' When you look around at all the evil in the world it most likely can be traced back to greed . We ca n't take it with us when we go . We came into the world naked and we 'll go out that way . Think about it ! What 's important ? I plan on spending eternity in Heaven with my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ ! You are right that the Bible says that Money is the root of all Evil and you cant take it with you ! People shouldnt take for granted that they are going to be here tomorrow..b/c NONE of us are Promised tomorrow or even the next minute or second . Take the time to Thank GOD when you open your eyes and you can put your feet on the floor !

He epitomized determination ! Among many of his priceless quotations , he said : '' I may be slow , but at least I do n't walk backwards '' ... He was considered quite homely , and when he was accused of being two-faced during a debate with his opponent Steven Douglas , he replied , '' If I had another face , do you think I would be wearing this one ? '' ... ( The crowd loved it ! ) When his best General , Ulysses S. Grant , who at the time , was the only General winning any battles , was accused by his peers of being drunk all the time , he replied , `` Well , find out what he 's drinking , and send him another case of it , on me ! `` ... Lastly , he said , `` If I had one hour to cut down a tree , I would spend 45 minutes sharpening my axe '' ... Additionally , he had to bear the responsibilty of being at the center of our country 's most terrible War ...

"what are treadmills good for working out ? what do they tone up ? They 're good for your lower torso and your legs . That 's pretty much it .

If you really want a great workout , and to really tone up your muscles ( meaning to lose baby fat , get ripped , no spare tire , no water retention , etc. , etc ... . ) you need an overall cardiovascular workout . While a treadmill is good for that , you should consider a workout that encompasses the entire body for that will tone you up so much faster than if you did it halfway.Besides ... when those exercise videos say they can help you tone up your abs , or build up a certain body part ...

"Why is the Interior of an airplaine pressurized and what would happen if there was a hole in the exterior wall Explain why the interior of an airplane is pressurized when flying at high altitude . If a hole were punctured in an exterior wall , what would happen to the air pressure inside the plane ? An Airplane is pressurised to provide the same pressure as at sea level , or ground altitude for passanger confort and to provent altutiude sickness . You can not breath the air at 20,000 feet with the same amount of oxygen per beath as at sea level . You would pass out from a lack of oxygen . If you get a hole in the airplane outer wall bernoullis principle says that there would be a fall in presure vacume on the other side of the hole causeing a depressurization of the interior of the aircraft to the pressure of 20,000 feet . With a Depressure of cabin air you would see a fog of water droplets in the air , as the density of water in the air becomes more from the oxygen being sucked out of the cabin . As you have seen in movies the hole will be riped larger if it is big enough to alow a large amount of air though and the structure is weak enough in that area . In alot of aircrafts the outer wall is a part of the pressure system of the aircraft keeping a seperation between internal pressure and external pressure . The whole aircraft is not pressureized wings and rear areas . so a hole in those area would n't cause a problum for the passangers .",0

"Why do people say `` God bless you '' after one sneezes ? The custom of saying `` God bless you '' after a sneeze was begun literally as a blessing . Pope Gregory the Great ( 540-604 AD ) ascended to the Papacy just in time for the start of the plague ( his successor succumbed to it ) . When someone sneezed , they were immediately blessed ( `` God bless you ! '' ) in the hope that they would not subsequently develop the plague . All that prayer apparently worked , judging by how quickly the plague of 590 AD diminished . It is also interesting to note that it is impossible to close your eyes when you sneeze , so everytime I sneeze , I try to say a little prayer .",0

"why are women so mentally differant from men ? why is it that when a man knows that somthing is bothering a woman and he ask her `` whats wrong '' they always say `` nothing '' ... but if the roles are reversed he tells her whats bothering him . The right and left hemispheres of the human brain are connected by a huge nerve bundle called the corpus callosum . In the male fetus when male hormones are generated the corpus callosum shrinks reducing cross-communication . Because the left hemisphere deals with logic and the right hemisphere deals with emotion , women connect all logic better with emotion than men do . Although a man can chose , he is always either logical or emotional but rarely both at the same time . A man either flies off the handle or thinks the problem through . A woman can weep or laugh when she discovers something that makes sense . This explains why women are better at nurturing ( cranky ) children and men are better at hunting for bears ( or a six pack ) . You figure out the rest . I ca n't .",0

Some nations have populations from several completely different sources . This might also be true for the indigenous peoples of North America ( there is no such thing as a Native American ) . A member of the Shawnee is very much different than a Lakota.Generally speaking Americans are a very mixed people . Especially when one looks at the DNA and not just the records at the Courthouse.If you think it counts , then it counts . If not , it doesn ’ t .",0
"What 's the best ( K-12 or college ) class you ever took , and what made the experience great ? I 'm not a teacher myself , simply curious . My favorite class was a college class called The Short Fiction of Franz Kafka . It was discussion based , 3 hours long , and once a week . It was amazing how much I learned in that format . First off ... ... .I am such a language/English/literature person . But in college I had to take a statistics class . I was scared to death because I just so do n't have a mathematical mind . I loved it ! The teacher was amazing ... ... and related to each of us on such a personal level . The hilarious part was that it was one of those huge lecture type classes with over 200 people . Yet , she had this way of making it seem like she was talking straight to you . We would all be working problems and laughing and poking fun at our silly mistakes instead of feeling like we were losers for screwing up . Her tests were monstrously hard , but I ended up with an `` A '' in the course . Shows you what amazing teaching skills mixed with personable skills can do for students . I loved this question ... ... I 'm so glad you asked it . I have n't thought of her in so long . I really should go find her and tell her thanks sometime !",0

Why do you think that we have different languages if we were all children of Adam and Eve ? There is the scientific viewing : Adam and Eve do n't exist . It is just a Christian belief . The Christian theory : Adam and Eve do exist . But the people of earth ( their generations ) started talking and decided to build a tower that could reach up to the sky to be as high as God himself . God was not happy so he made them all have different languages . They were angry at each other for everybody thought the other was speaking gibberish . The idea was put off because they could not communicate and all of them moved far away from each other . The Chinese talkers moved to China . The French talkers moved to France . and so forth ... .,0
"What is the metal from which penny coins are made of ? Following is a brief chronology of the metal composition of the cent coin ( penny ) : * The composition was pure copper from 1793 to 1837 . * From 1837 to 1857 , the cent was made of bronze ( 95 percent copper , and five percent tin and zinc ) . * From 1857 , the cent was 88 percent copper and 12 percent nickel , giving the coin a whitish appearance . * The cent was again bronze ( 95 percent copper , and five percent tin and zinc ) from 1864 to 1962 . ( Note : In 1943 , the coin 's composition was changed to zinc-coated steel . This change was only for the year 1943 and was due to the critical use of copper for the war effort . However , a limited number of copper pennies were minted that year . You can read more about the rare , collectible 1943 copper penny in `` What 's So Special about the 1943 Copper Penny . '' ) * In 1962 , the cent 's tin content , which was quite small , was removed . That made the metal composition of the cent 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc . * The alloy remained 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc until 1982 , when the composition was changed to 97.5 percent zinc and 2.5 percent copper ( copper-plated zinc ) . Cents of both compositions appeared in that year .",0

"How does one approach a total jerk coach who is mean , unsensitve and hurtful to my daughter ? She is 16 and loves basket - but the coach ( who is the head of the association unfortunately ) is a horrible person . She refuses to quit the team but is terribly unhappy , sometimes cries , does n't want to talk about it in detail and does n't want us to talk to him . I wish she would quit but she refuses . I see her terribly upset - what can we do ? She thinks she can continue suffering , but I think he tries to get her to quit . A total unsensitive ... ... .. ! Well ... getting too involved will embarass your daughter and possibly even make it harder for her to stay on the team , which she obviously wants . Kudos to her for sticking withit even when it upsets her ! Make your presence known to the coach but dont try to confront him or tell him what to do . I am a swimming coach , and when a parent goes out of their way to thank me or let me know they appreciate what I am doing , then I am more positive to the kids as a whole . Try being ridiculously nice to the jerk . Come a little early to a practice one day and watch the end , and then when all the girls go to the locker rooms walk up to the coach , introduce yourself , and tell him that the kids seem to be doing such a wonderful job and that you are so pleased with the progress they are all making . Making yourself as NICE as possible will make it harder for him to be mean to your daughter.Then , tell your daughter how proud of her you are for sticking with it even when its hard for her . This is a big deal for someone so young , and it says a lot about her character . Good luck !",0

"compare Sabine 's equation with Eyring and Millinton-Sette 's equation ? All of these people worked on models to aid in acoustical design of ampitheatres ( or any space where clearly hearing sound is important ) . The three equations that you listed all take the same general form , and the latter two are subsequent improvements in Sabine 's original work. '' W.C . Sabine carried out a considerable amount of research in this area and arrived at an empirical relationship between the volume of an auditorium , the amount of absorptive material within it and a quantity which he called the Reverberation Time ( RT ) . As defined by Sabine , the RT is the time taken for a continuous sound within a room to decay by 60 dB after being abruptly switched off and is given by : RT = ( 0.161V ) / Awhere V is the volume of the enclosure ( m³ ) and A is the total absorption within the enclosure ( sabine ) . `` `` Several different approaches have been used to derive equations which give values of reverberation time in better agreement with measured results from less reverberant rooms . One of these , the Norris-Eyring formula , assumes an intermittent decay with the arrival of fewer and fewer reflections . This gives the following formula : '' RT = ( 0.161V ) / ( -S ln ( 1-a ) ) '' where S is the total surface area ( m² ) and a becomes the average absorption coefficient . `` `` When the materials of a room have a wide variety of absorption coefficients , the best predictions are obtained by the Millington-Sette equation . This is simply a matter of substituting an effective absorption coefficient ae = -ln ( 1-ai ) into Sabine 's equation to give : '' RT = ( 0.161V ) / ( sum ( -Si ln ( 1-Ai ) ) where Si is the surface area of the ith material , and Ai is its actual absorption coefficient .",0

"How do I tell if my wife 's affair went further than the internet and casual meetings ? She has been meeting with this coworker after meetings and IM each other . I found the emails nothing bad , but a Blog of my wife saying he 's all she can think about at meetings and wondering if he would leave his wife for her how hot he is ect.. My wife says it was just a crush and nothing physical . I 'm not sure this is the truth , since she lied about everything else , until I found out for myself . Lying is part of the Affair . First print a hard copy of the BLog , and all Emails for future referance . Chances are it has gone farther and she is covering it up . The only way to get through the lies is to catch her in the act . I suggest you contact a private investagetor to look into the matter , They have knowledge and resourses that you would not have , plus by having a third party you get honest information and not biased based on how you feel . Now if you learn that she is not cheating , `` yet '' then I suggest you work on the relationship before she does . I would suggest you seek help in counciling . Your not going to be able to resolve the issue by yourself . She is looking at other men probably due to an unmet `` NEED '' at home . You can read books like those listed below to help identify what those needs are , but until you begin meeting the `` NEED '' your self , and expose the lies you have no chance of saving the marriage .",0

"How did the advancing technology of weapons affect WWI ? The primary advances were the airplane , submarine , machine gun , tank , and posionous gas . The machine gun made the frontal assault very costly thus trenches were used to protect the soldiers . These trenches were also lived in , which produced rat infestation , constantly wet conditions , and poor sanitation . All of these will contribute to the spread of disease and trench foot which sometimes resulted in amputation and even death . To attack the machine guns the tank was developed and although early models were notoriously unreliable their use in the final months contributed to the Allied victory . Poison gas will kill , cripple , and blind thousands . Airplanes initially used only for scouting will later develop into fighters against other planes and bombers . This will lead to some of the best known participants of the war and the glory of being a pilot ( Red Baron , Rickenbaker ) . Finally the submarine will spread the war to innocents on passenger ships and slow commerce to England and from the United States . More importantly it was the German use of Unrestricted submarine Warfare ( along with the Zimmerman note ) that brought the US into the war . It was the infusion of large numbers of Americans with their aggressive fighting ability that will be the deciding factor in the Allied victory .",0

"Why does acidophilus have to be refrigerated ? What about the kinds that supposedly do n't have to be refrigerated ? And what 's up with enteric coating ? And do I ask too many questions ? Acidophilus needs to be refridgerated because it is a bacteria . Since it is a living organism , in order for it to stay alive , they have you bring it down to a temperature that basically `` immobilizes '' it so it does n't die . They do sell those that do n't have to be stored that way , but all the information i 've read suggests that they do n't really work the same as most of the bacteria are dead by the time you take them . The enteric coating prevents the bacteria in the pill from being released into your stomach and thus digested ( killed ) . Instead it passes into your intestines and is released there , which is where the acidophilus bacteria are meant to be living , so it is best that they reach there alive ! No , you do n't ask too many questions ... as long as they are valid .",0

"do u people think ice age will come back agein ? I have an MS in paleoclimatology , and I have to say that it is one of the most fascinating topics Ive ever delved into . It 's also amusing to see non-scientist 's responses here and on other message boards ! If you wanted to ask a scientist , you would have to define what you mean when you say `` ice age . '' There are varying degrees of `` ice ages . '' For brevity sake , I will assume you mean the relatively cold periods that last approximately 100,000 years that have dominated global climate for the last 2 million years . Contrary to popular belief , there are periods during the `` ice ages '' that are almost as warm as today.Based on paleoclimate evidence that suggest the ice ages have come and gone at least six times in the last 2 million years , the probability is that it will occur again.The difficult and possibly dramatic question is : when ? Seeing as though the last `` ice age '' generally ended about 12,000 years ago ( this is debatable , since there is no one date where everywhere across the globe it suddenly became warm ) , and the average interglacial is 10,000 years , we are overdue.Consider the widely accepted hypothesis that `` global warming '' -- whether it be natural , human-induced , or a combination -- can ultimately ( Ill spare you the details ) lead to an ice age . Melting polar sea ice , indicator species dying off in the tropics , large disintigrations of ice shelves in the Antarctic , estimations that global sea level may rise 4 inches in the next 100 years , `` wild '' weather in many parts of the US ... are these all tell-tale signs that we have already begun down the road to the next glacial period ? ! ? ! ? New-ish data suggest that past climates have changed rapidly -- like someone else mentioned either in this thread or another similar one -- several degrees Celsius in a matter of decades or less ! The great ice sheets that once reached as far south as Long Island and Iowa wont reappear for tens of thousands of years , but it could get chilly across much of the country real quick ! And possibly as soon as 2020 !",0

"why is missouri called the show me state ? There are a number of stories and legends behind Missouri 's sobriquet `` Show-Me '' state . The slogan is not official , but is common throughout the state and is used on Missouri license plates.The most widely known legend attributes the phrase to Missouri 's U.S . Congressman Willard Duncan Vandiver , who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1897 to 1903 . While a member of the U.S. House Committee on Naval Affairs , Vandiver attended an 1899 naval banquet in Philadelphia . In a speech there , he declared , `` I come from a state that raises corn and cotton and cockleburs and Democrats , and frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me . I am from Missouri . You have got to show me . '' Regardless of whether Vandiver coined the phrase , it is certain that his speech helped to popularize the saying .",0

"Ice to Steam ? Calculate the amount of heat ( in kJ ) needed to change 59.90 g ice at -17.87 oC to steam at 250.7 oC . ( Some constants for H2O : Heat of fusion : 333 J/g ; Heat of vaporization : 2260 J/g ; Specific heats : Ice : 2.1 J/g.K , Water : 4.2 J/g.K , Steam : 2.0 J/g.K ) Note : I 'm going to convert all the intermediate steps into kJ by dividing by 1000 . I wo n't show that step . First , let 's find out how much heat it 'll take to get the ice from -17.87 degrees to zero degrees , where it has to be in order to melt . This is a change of 17.87 degrees . ( Because one degree Celsius and one Kelvin is the same size degree , they are interchangable . ) We 'll use the specific heat capacity of ice . 59.90 g ice * ( 2.1 J/g*K ) * ( 17.87 K ) =2248 J = 2.248 kJNext , let 's find out how much energy it would take to melt that ice at 0 degrees to water at 0 degrees using the heat of fusion:59.90 g ice * ( 333 J/g ) =19950 J = 19.95 kJNext , let 's find out how much energy it would take to get the water from 0 to 100 degrees ( so it can become steam ) using the specific heat of water:59.90 g water * ( 4.2 J/g*K ) * ( 100 . K ) =25160 J = 25.16 kJNext , let 's find out how much energy it would take to evaporate the water using the heat of vaporization : 59.90 g water* ( 2260 J/g ) =135400J = 135.4 kJFinally , let 's find out how much energy it would take to get the steam from 100 to 250.7 degrees for a total change of 150.7 ; we will use the specific heat capacity of steam:59.90 g steam* ( 2.0 J/g*K ) * ( 150.7 K ) =18050 J= 18.05 kJ . Now , just add up all of the heats required at each of these steps : 2.248 kJ+19.95 kJ+25.16 kJ+135.4 kJ+18.05 kJ=200.8 kJ , with correct significant figures .",0

"What is nesidioblastomia ? It 's disease of some kind , but I am not sure what it is . nesidioblastosis Nesidioblastosis is a controversial medical term for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia attributed to an abnormal microscopic appearance of pancreatic islet development . The term was coined in the first half of the 20th century . The abnormal histologic aspects of the tissue included the presence of islet cell enlargement , islet cell dysplasia , beta cells budding from ductal epithelium , and islets in apposition to ducts.By the 1970s , nesidioblastosis was primarily used to describe the pancreatic dysfunction associated with persistent congenital hyperinsulinism and in most cases from the 1970s until the 1970s , it was used as a synonym for what we now refer to as congenital hyperinsulinism.The term fell into disfavor after it was recognized in the late 1980s that the characteristic tissue features were sometimes seen in pancreatic tissue from normal infants and even adults , and is not consistently associated with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia . Most congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by different mechanisms than excessive proliferation of beta cells in a fetal pattern.A small number of case reports have purported to describe nesidioblastosis in adults",0

"Hi there , Does anyone have advice for people considering starting a relationship with somebody with Herpes ? I am having a difficult time getting comfortable with the fact that my girlfriend has HSV I and II ( and I do not ) . I am afraid , knowing that if I choose to stay in this relationship , I will eventually end up getting it as well ... and there is no way to know how my body will react to the virus ' . Right now I am viewing the virus as a magnifying glass that makes small concerns seem like larger ones , because it is a huge commitment just to try to see if the relationship will be successful . The relationship would already have more than normal amounts of stressors because of geographical issues ( I 'd have to move a long distance to be with her ) and other reasons . We have been doing the long-distance dating which is great , but distance makes the heart grow fonder as well . I feel like a very bad person for having these feelings , but I 'm trying to get a grasp on things , so please help if you have any insights . being educated on these things is best.. and knowing the risks . If she was dis-abled would you feel differantly ? feelings that are from the true heart can over come any ostacle ... never feel bad about weighing out things that can effect the rest of your life.. always good to reach out to get knowledge..",0

"why in dry cell , cathode is marked '+ ' while in car battery anode is marked '+ ' ? Polarity of electricity was specified long ago by Benjamin Frankline before there was a practical means of detecting electrons . He could have tossed a coin to specify + or - . The thought was that electricity would flow ( like water ) from + ( high ) to - ( low ) . Unfortunately it was discovered that electrons actually flow from - to + in an external wire , but it was too late and we live with convention now . In a way it really does n't matter as long as all circuit designers agree on the convention since we can not see electrons ; unless you are designing a vacuum tube ( etc . ) where electrons must physically flow from a heated element that boils them off to a grounded plate that collects them . Cathode is normally the negative pole .",0

"how can add 2 harddrives to my computer ? Each IDE channel can accept 2 devices . Most motherboards come with 2 IDEs . So 4 devices . Your CD/DVD drive will also be plugged into this . So , if there are no other IDE devices plugged in you can install 2 more hard disks . Each channel should have a Master and Slave . These are controlled by small jumpers on the back of the devices . This has to be done correctly.Some motherboards also have SATA connections if these are not used then you can use SATA hard disks.If you dont want to open up the computer and fiddle about with cables and jumpers , then get external hard disks with USB and can be plugged in to the USB socket in your computer . Much easier.Good LuckBattery Wizard",0

"use of wildcard characters in searches ? They are actually called `` Operators '' in searching . Many hidden ways to do searching . In the link I provide look at the first section called Operator Examples . You can mix them too . Lets say you were searching for info about Ben Roethlisberger you should type in `` Ben Roethlisberger '' . Why you may ask ? Well lets say during your search without the `` it hits a page with a person named Ben Dover and another person called Jim Roethlisberger . Well both words are contained in the search and it counts . With the `` around Ben Roethlisberger it finds all words together . Although his name is sooo unusual you may not have to worry . But a good example . Try google with Jim Smith and look at the number of results returned , then try `` Jim Smith '' and see the number returned . I did not search for it and I have not idea who Jim Smith is .

"Why does society treat us as a unisex ? According to biological studies men and women are different in physical makeup , hormones , and even brain activity . According to psychological studies men and women have different wants , needs , and desires . Where some are the same they often have different priority levels.So , why does western culture treat us as a unisex ? That we are all supposed to be the same and teats down people who accept those distinct difference ? Western culture treats us as equal because of the ERA , womens rights movements , and feminist groups that demand equality . Unfortunately , there seems to be an either/or side-effect . We are either unisex beings with no differences , or we become stereotypes of man/woman . There is no middle ground yet because the politically correct crowd is afraid of stepping on toes .",0

"Why do so many women like bad boy types ? The debate of `` nice guys vs. bad boys '' has been raging for quite a long time . The nature of being a `` nice guy '' , however , is commonly misunderstood . It is believed that being polite , considerate , friendly , tender , romantic , etc . is what being a `` nice guy '' is all about and thus those qualities should be avoided , as it is the `` bad boy '' , the rude , the inconsiderate , the impolite , the rough guy who always gets the girl while the `` nice guy '' is waiting outside in the pouring rain with flowers in his hand.It does n't mean that women prefer rude over polite , inconsiderate over considerate , etc . It all becomes clear when we look at a very important issue often overlooked when trying to define what makes the `` bad boys '' beat the `` nice guys '' when it comes to getting the girls . It is sexuality - the `` bad boys '' are not afraid to show that they are sexual beings , while the `` nice guys '' hide their sexuality as a part of their agenda of being friendly , polite , and courteous towards women .",0

"what is the best way to get money for college ? The first thing you need to know about money for college is that there are two kinds . Free and not free . In other words there are loans and scholarships . You want scholarships first and whatever is n't paid for by those can be covered with loans . To get scholarships some people think you have to be a `` straight A '' student or an exceptional athlete . Although those things do help , they are n't always necessary . You may have certain unique talents and abilities that can earn you scholarships regardless of your grades . Try visiting www.fastweb.com . You can use this site to make a profile and they will e-mail you scholarship opportunities that apply specifically to you ! Two kids from my high school won a scholarship for making their prom outfits out of duct tape ! True story ! Not all of the scholarships are that crazy but again , they do n't necessarily relate to grades or sports . If you do have good grades and/or play sports ; great ! Use that in your profile and they will send you opportunities that apply directly to your talents . It is totally free and there is no limit as to how many scholarships you can apply for and even win . So try to pay for everything you can with scholarships and then you may need to fill in some gaps with loans . Your next stop : www.fasfa.com . There you will apply for financial aid . You will need your most recent W-2 and your parents help when you apply . If you do n't have parents or you are over 24 years of age you get to skip the parent section . This site may reward you with some scholarships as well but it 's usually mostly government loans . That is why I would suggest applying for dozens of scholarships first . Good luck finding the money and good luck once you start school . Remember ; for every hour spent in class you should spend two hours studying !",0

"What is the bladder 's job ? In the anatomy of mammals , the urinary bladder is the organ that collects urine excreted by the kidneys prior to disposal by urination . Urine enters the bladder via the ureters and exits via the urethra. -- -- -- -- -AnatomyThe urinary bladder is a hollow , muscular and distensible organ that sits on the pelvic floor ( superior to the prostate in males ) . On its anterior border lies the pubic symphysis and , on its posterior border , the vagina ( in females ) and rectum ( in males ) . The urinary bladder is normally capable of storing 1.1-1.3 liters of urine , but because it is made up of transitional epithelium it is able to stretch to volumes of even several litres.The ureters enter the bladder diagonally from its dorsolateral floor in an area called the trigone . The trigone is a triangular shaped area on the postero-inferior wall of the bladder . The urethra exits at the lowest point of the triangle of the trigone -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Detrusor muscleThe detrusor muscle is a layer of the urinary bladder wall , made up of smooth muscle fibers arranged in inner and outer longitudinal layers and a middle circular layer .

"Is it really worth buying and trying Crest White Strips for whitening teeth ? Yes , and , actually , the Crest White Strips Premium are worth the extra money . For some reason , they do n't make your teeth as sensitive during the whitening process.One thing that you have to keep in mind is that you have to find the time to use the product . You have to keep the strips on for 30 minutes at a time , twice a day . I usually did this before I went to work in the morning , and after I got home , before I went out again . But it 's kindof hard to commit to if you have a really busy schedule.My uncle is an orthodontist and told me that if you have really sensitive teeth , Crest White Strips are still safe to use . Just because they cause pain does n't mean they 're harming you , they 're just making your teeth sensitive during the whitening process.Happy smiles !",0

"how can I make my Linksys router encryption work with SBC DSL ? The only way it works now is w/o encryption. ? I 've tried using Linksys ' 64-bit and 128-bit encryption for its wireless router . When I try to use them , I lose my SBC Global DSL connection to the internet . You internet connection is n't going down but only the ability of your wireless devices to access the internet . Once you enable encryption on your router you then need to configure you laptop/pc 's wireless connection to match the ssid and wep key . Once that is done then your connection should work just fine . Wep is n't the best security but it is a start . If you are going to use it then I would use 128bit and disable broadcast ssid . As for configuring your laptop/pc it depends on if you are using an application or depending on windows to control the wireless card . An external card could be using an application . If it is an internal built in card then more than likely it is being controlled by windows . You can go to your network connections and verify . If so then there is an option to configure your wep settings .",0

"what does the government hide from the people ? Things that would harm the 'security ' of the government . Sounds nice , but in reality , they hide anything that would interfere with the status quo . Since they do n't want a wrong impression of what they have screwed up in the past , they hide pretty much everything they use to make decisions and the actions they take under the premise of 'the interest of national security ' . This could be technology which would help enemies ( so-called ; expanding who constitutes an 'enemy ' greatly expands what can be kept secret ) , anything that would ruin our economy or the main corporations which support it , anything that might reveal how our weapons work , policies about how things are REALLY kept secret , plans for keeping the government ( and friends ) safe after a major attack , strategic sources of materials which are n't publicly disclosed already , scientific data that might cause panic , scientific data that might cause distrust of the government , inventions which could be used as weapons ( yes , they monitor patent applications ) , and all the usual things like who is a spy for who , how we monitor communications , how other countries monitor our communications ( and sell us the info ) , how much money our intelligence agencies spend , and who in our country is suspected of being a threat to any of the above things.I think that pretty much covers it . If anything like paranormal activity , UFO 's , or antigravity technology falls under the categories above , welllllll ... .And do n't forget that they wo n't tell you if something they tell you is really false or misleading so that you do n't investigate something else they are hiding .

"Why do my feet smell so bad ? The main reason some people 's feet ( or more precisely , some people 's socks and shoes ) smell worse than other people 's is that some people sweat more than other people . This is just one of the many variable physiological qualities of human beings . This is also why sometimes your feet smell much worse than at other times -- it all has to do with how much you sweat.So , since foot odor is caused by bacteria digesting sweat , there are two main ways to reduce the stink . You can : * decrease the amount of bacteria on your feet * decrease the amount of sweat that collects on your feet and in your shoes Reducing the level of bacteria is really a matter of cleanliness . To control the bacteria population on you feet , you should : * wash your feet with strong anti-bacterial soap * wear clean socks * do n't wear the same shoes everyday - give a pair of shoes 24 hours or more to air out before wearing them again To reduce the amount of sweat that collects in your shoes , you should : * wear well-ventilated shoes instead of very constrictive shoes , such as boots * always wear socks , preferably made of cotton or other absorbent materials that absorb a lot of the sweat so the bacteria ca n't feed on it * change your socks a few times a day * buy some absorbent Odor-Eater type shoe inserts * apply an antiperspirant to your feet If your foot odor is really bad and these solutions do n't help much , then you should see a doctor . There are a number of prescription drugs that can treat serious foot odor , some by killing bacteria and some by reducing foot sweat .",0

"does putting a minor on a credit account as an authorized user help them establish credit ? i thought that minor could not establish credit under any circumstances and that authorized users are simply that-authorized . they simply have permission to use the account and they have no responsibility . it will merely show as on the bureau once they are of age as they are an authorized user - and should not affect the bureau one way or the other . Yes it does ! Its a great way to help young people establish credit . My parents did it for me , and my 3 yr old already has a platinum . This is also a good way to help people with not so good credit to make it better . Still probably a good idea to be the one who physically has the credit card , until the minor is mature and responsible enough.Keep in mind that its a double edged sword , the authorized user of the account can also harm anyone whos on the account , such as if they have poor late payments or declare bankruptcy that can affect the minor with bad credit as well .",0

Might lose the competitive edge because of rework . Leaks always possible.2 ) Weld more permanent and stable in regard to environment and conditions.Does n't need continuous Inspection .

"what should I do ? I feel like all of my prayers are'nt getting through to God , I 've backslide alot lately and I 'm scared that God dosent accept me any more . It seems like every thing I do is wrong , and conviction jumps on me and makes me feel so down . I feel like I 'm a million miles away from God . And all day long I 'm constanty thinking what I can do to please God . Can any one figure out what is wrong with me and my walk with Christ ? I just long for more of God to be in my life , and i can not stop thinking about Him , He 's on my mind all day long . We are called to rejoice and be glad ( Matt 5:11-12 ) . But we are also warned to be sober-minded ( Rom 12:3 ) . One of the most fearful verses I know that keeps me most sober is Matthew 7:21-23 : 21 “ Not everyone who says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter the kingdom of heaven , but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven . 22Many will say to me on that day , ‘ Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy in your name , and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles ? ’ 23Then I will tell them plainly , ‘ I never knew you . Away from me , you evildoers ! ’ You can not DO anything to please God . He is pleased with perfection . Jesus is perfection , and died for your sins in your place . Do good because he loves you , not to pay your way back `` in '' . Grace is a gift not deserved . See Romans 7 : 14-20.Love the Lord your God with Everything-Trust in Him . The life of the Christian is not easy , it may in fact be hard , for some it has cost their lives , but the rewards for trust and obediance will be phenominal .",0

"i dunno how to have sex & i'l b gettin maried soon.being a muslim i cant evr do it b4 my weding.i need help ? actually being a muslim and then eastern culture we girls dont know much about sex.my fiance like girls who are active sexually.i dunno how to do it.im scared i wont b able to satisfy him.i tried searching online but didnt get get any proper information.its not possible for me to buy those kinda books or watch movies that would help me.coz first of all they arent that easily available and my family wont ever let me watch it.but my fiance really wants me to know more about it.what can i do about it ? where can i get the info from ? i know the obvious answer that many are probably thinking , if he loves you then you will be fine . in fact the is not at true as most people would like to think . Your not just talking about sex you 're talking about intamcy as well . WHen you do have sex for the first time i wo n't lie it hurts . The reason it will hurt for the most part is because oyu will be so nervous about be nakeed and having sex that all of your muscles will be conctracting . Which will then in turn make it that more difficult for your finance to enter . just remeber that when you have sex with him that he loves oyu he wo n't be juding you in anyway he will be overwhelmed with the fact that he is with you for the rest of his life that he will just be in awe . also keep in mind that the first time is going to be a little bumpy because you two do n't know each others movements yets . so yees it will be awkward . having sex for the first time is different for eeveryone . but it may be easier , since it seems to me that he has had sex before , if he were to get on top . so that way you wo n't feeel that yopu have to do everything . Something that might make it easier is buy some kind of lubercation it makes it easier to get sttarted . with the lubercation you put it on him to make it more arousing for him and this will give you and oppurtunity to see , and feel what your husband feels like . make it fun for yourself . while you are doing that for him he could be doing something for you . either kissing your neck messaging your inner thighs . if you have a little for play it might take away some of the tension . It is most definetly going to be hard for you to be doing all of this . but just remeber that it will get easier . do n't forget that he 's not the only one that is there for fun . soemthing that might also arouse him and you as well is take is hands and put them on various parts of you and then you return the favor while he carressing you you do the same . moving on to the sex part of it . pull him towaards you so that he knows to get on top . then opoen your legs so that it is comfortable to you and he can get his whole body in . if you do n't feel comfortable adjust and then proceed . when he starts to insert in to you MAKE SURE HE GOES SLOWLY . if anything starts to hurt tell him adn he should either stop or pull out . the key is to communicate . IT will be uncomfortable the first couple of times that you do it . but the lubercation should help out to some degree . After he has entered all the way , now is the time when you should be more relaxed . Now the hardest paart is over . While haveing sex make suree at all times that you are comfortable if your not then sex just wo n't be the same later . if your lower back hurts put a pillow under neith your back and continue . if you do n't know how to move your body then have him move your body so that you both will enjoy it . and if you feel comfortable enough you amy want to get on top . If you do get on to , then just bend your knees so that they are by his hips , and sit directly over top of his penis . oncew he is back inside then move back towards is knees slightly and begin to move . if you do n't know how take is haveds and put them on your hips and let him know that he needs to help . once he gets you going you can do it on your own . Of course this is all just a suggestion and you should do what feels right to you , i hope that i could help you CONGRADULATIONS and good luck . just remember RELAX .",0

"Men do you perfer thick girls over skinney girls or skinney girls over thick girls ? Tell me with a little detail so I can really undserstand your reasons . Tell me the benefits of your preference . I myself prefer skinney girls over thick girls because I am skinny . Skinney girls also tend to be more fit unless they are too skinney . Thicker girls are usually fat . The things I like to do might not be able to be done by a thicker girl . To me skinner girls are hotter . You can check out their figure . However with thicker girls their figure is , um , sometimes lumpy and such ; not as pleasing to look at . Personality is also important when it comes to this subject unless you 're looking for a quick hook-up .

"What type of rocks are usually taken from quarries ? Any type of rock or mineral ore can be quarried if the deposit is close enough to the surface of the earth . Most quarry operations are for limestone and dolomite in the US . The primary product of quarries is what is called 'natural aggregates ' which most people just call gravel . Of the natural aggregates produced in the US , 71 % are limestone and dolomite , 15 % are granite , and 8 % is from gabbro , basalt and diabase . The remaining 6 % is sandstone , quartzite , marble , slate , shell , and volcanic cinder and scoria . These statistics are from the USGS . Coal strip mines and iron and copper open pit mines are generally not called quarries , but are very much the same in that they dig into the earth in open holes to recover minerals .

"I want to become cricket umpire , please let me know how i have to start with . Thanks ? I am a professional and an avid follower of the game of cricket . I have this fascination to become a professional cricket umpire and I dream to become a member of the elite panel of umpires of ICC someday . I would like to know how to get started so as to be able to realise my dream . I am not at all aware about the procedure to be followed in this regard . Kindly guide me on the same . Introduction to international umpires and refereesOne of the ICC 's key priorities is to ensure that international umpires and referees perform at the highest standards possible . The ICC appoints the world 's best officials to the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires and Referees and provides an assessment and support system to aid umpires and referees in their development . The ICC has four officiating panels : • The Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires ; • The Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Referees ; • The Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires ; and• The ICC Associates and Affiliates Umpires Panel.The role of a cricket umpire is one of the hardest officiating tasks in international sport and sometimes calls are made for technology to play a greater role in cricket , but the ICC believes it is important not to override the basic philosophy that cricket is a game and human umpires are part of that game . The ICC is committed to trialing technological innovations but technology will only be introduced into the game if it : • can provide conclusive answers ; • is practical to introduce for all international cricket ; • does not compromise the role of on-field umpires ; and• does not change the essence in which the game is played.Becoming a member of the Emirates Elite and International Panel of ICC UmpiresTo become a member of the Emirates Elite or International Panels of ICC Umpires , officials must be standing regularly in first-class cricket in a Full Member country of the ICC.From the list of first-class umpires , each country nominates their two best-performing umpires to the Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires , and their next best to the position of TV Umpire.Members of the Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires are then eligible to be chosen for ICC events such as the ICC Cricket World Cup , ICC U/19 Cricket World Cup and the ICC Champions Trophy.They can also be appointed from time to time to stand in Test matches to provide cover for members of the Elite panel . The ICC closely monitors the performance of these umpires at international cricket . Those that show that they have the qualities to perform at the highest level , may then be invited to become full-time members of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires .",0

"Should there be a law concerning credit related lawsuits ? Now that congress has passed the new bankruptcy laws that do not allow credit obligations to be totally wiped clean , this has given creditors free reign to file lawsuits for bad credit . The amount of lawsuits are jumping high as it is forcing people to file bankruptcy which under the new rules forces them to pay regardless . This use to be bad policy for creditors as it created bad business for consumers . Do creditors have right to sue consumers with money they have made off of consumers ? Should credit be regarded as an investment made by a creditor to a consumer and if that investment goes bad to not cry about it ? Are in likewise manner people allowed to sue companies and stock brokers if our investments are lost for one reason or another ? So if that can not be allowed should corporations be allowed to sue consumers for their own bad investments ? Should this be allowed or should congress amend the law to disallow lawsuits for credit obligations ? Although we may like to think better of our society , credit card companies wield a tremendous amount of lobbying power . However , can you imagine knowing that you will be exonerated from your credit obligations ; what would be the incentive to pay . The government has a difficulty time in screwing with the constitutionally protected freedom to contract , so by virtue of such they will not willingly excuse the debtor for breaching that obligation .",0

"what do you do for excessive mucus production ? I have excessive mucus production . I have two sinus surgerys , but the mucus was there befor the surgerys . It is so bad that it comes from my gums . I have a bad cough , it always produces a mouth full of mucus . It pockets in the back of my throat . It has gotten so bad that it disrupts my sleep . I take a cloth to bed each night to clean my mouth . If any one has ever had this problem , please let me know what you did for relife . I have spent a small fortune on doctors and medicine . As of now , no help . Thank you . I had the same problem , I could n't breathe through my nose because , my nose and mouth were constantly full of mucus and I was constantly spitting out this gunk . Sometimes , I would be choking and gagging in my sleep . A relative sent me a print-out of the side effects of the medication I was taking . It included breathing problems , mucus buildup , nodules ( which I now have exactly where my sinuses are ) and a lot of other dangerous side effects . I went off the med . and while I still have some mucus production it is no where near what it used to be . My doctor tried to get me to go back on the same med . even after I told him about the mucus problems it caused . He said it did n't do that . When I insisted that it did , he looked it up on his computer and then said `` if that happens again , you can always go off it '' . Needless to say , I refused to take it . Also , on one exam , the nurse told me I had polyps in my nose . She told me to see an ENT and have them removed ( surgically ) . I am glad I did n't . I just saw an M.D . on tv who said that when polyps in your nose are removed , they usually will come back . He said a safe non-surgical way to get rid of them is to use Nasonex twice a day and it is safe to do that . I think I 'll take his advice and try it . I do n't know why some doctors first advice is surgery especially if there is a non-surgical way to remedy a problem . I hope you find a solution to your problems .",0

"What really distinguishes AJAX programming from traditional web programming ( html/javascript ) ? AJAX uses a bit of javascript that uses the XmlHTTP object . This object , opens up a connection to a Web server , transmits and receives data , then calls back the javascript on the page which was used to invoke it.What this means is that changes on the client side can communicate with the server , then dynamically update the client user interface without having to request a new Web page from the server.While this slightly complicates developing Web applications that use AJAX technologies ( which , by the way , is just a name given to the various technologies employed to use this methodology ) , it makes for a very smooth user experience since they are not constantly refreshing Web pages.AJAX applications give an appearance of a 'thick client ' application while still being a 'thin client ' ( i.e . application that runs in a Web browser . ) However , it is important to note that network communication is still going on in the background while the application is being used .",0

"Why do some people grind their teeth when they sleep ? Teeth grinding , or bruxism , is often related to stress . It also can be caused by crooked or missing teeth or by something that creates an abnormal bite , such as a high spot on a molar . To diagnose bruxism , dentists look for flattened spots on the teeth . Treatment includes smoothing down those high spots and behavior modification for stress reduction . Your dentist also may recommend a mouth guard or a custom-made splint to be worn at night . These prevent teeth from coming together , which interrupts the grinding and gives muscles a chance to relax.Here 's some more information : Bruxism can have a variety of psychological and physical causes . These include stress , the body 's reaction to poor tooth alignment , as a complication of severe brain injury , or as an uncommon side effect of some antidepressant medications .",0

"What is the differance between devil worshipping and satanism ? Satanism is a religious , semi-religious and/or philosophical movement whose adherents recognize Satan as an archetype , pre-cosmic force , or some aspect of human nature . Although named for Satan , a name associated with evil and temptation , Satanism is more commonly the name given to certain spiritual paths which emphasize the Left-Hand Path , as opposed to the much more common Right-Hand Path . Left-Handers believe in spiritual enrichment through their own work on themselves , and that ultimately they are answerable only to themselves , while Right-Handers believe in spiritual enrichment through the dissolution or submission of the self to ( or into ) something greater . Many Satanists do not in fact worship a deity called Satan , or necessarily any other deity , nor do they follow a principle of evil . This aspect of their beliefs is very commonly misunderstood.This is very different to people who worship Satan , these are usually emotionally immature people , because obviously satan does n't want to be worshipped by the creatures he despises .",0

"how do i factor this ? 16xsquared-15+8x You can use the AC Method to answer this question : First , rewrite the expression so it 's in the form Ax^2 + Bx + C where A , B , and C are constants ( numbers ) 16x^2 + 8x - 15There 's no common factors we could take out first , so ... Multiply A x C , which in this case is 16 x -15 or -240 . Then look for factors of this number that add up to B . You 're looking for two numbers that fill in the blanks below : __ x __ = -240__ + __ = 8Prime facorization will help give you some ideas , or make an ordered list of numbers that multiply to -240 . 240 and -1120 and -280 and -360 and -448 and -540 and -630 and -824 and -1020 and -12See how the last pair of numbers satisfies the conditions ?

"Should car be banned in city centre ? Please give me the reason and more details because I need to write a arguement essay on it . Well , there are two sides to this issue - I do n't know if you are arguing in favor , or against it - so here goes.On the plus side ( i.e . banning cars in the city center ) , you would reduce traffic , congestion , wear and tear on the streets . You could hold events ( parades , celebrations , rally 's , etc . ) in the area without significantly affecting traffic . Also , car-free areas in the downtown ( i.e . city center ) can help to revitalize an area of the downtown - it can be made to look nice , maybe with something like nice bricks , or cobblestones.On the other hand ( against banning cars in the city center ) , if you ban cars in the downtown area , you 'll be loosing revenue from on-street parking and any parking tickets the city issues , depending upon the size of the car-free area , it will be more difficult to get to the city center , it might adversely affect sales for businesses in the affected area.One option , used in downtown Minneapolis ( Nicollet Mall ) allows taxis and busses , but not private ( i.e . car ) traffic . This allows people to get down to the area via public transportation , or by taking a taxi . Of course , it 's only one block wide by several ( 5 or 6 I think ) blocks long.Here are two sites that might provide helpful information : http : //www.worldcarfree.net/http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_street",0

"What some things to say to a girl on the phone or how to start off a Conversation ? Im talkin bout a girl I just met ! got this in a daily emailAs far as starting conversations with women , here are a few ideas for you ... First of all , you must realize that your bodylanguage is more important than the words you use.Wherever you are , and whatever the situation , youMUST remember that your composure and bodylanguage are the keys . I 've watched a lot of guys approach a LOT ofwomen in my day . And I can usually tell within thefirst few SECONDS if the guy knows what he 's doingwith women ... and if he 's going to be successful . Most guys use submissive , apologetic bodylanguage and voice tones ... they almost look as ifthey 're pleading with a woman to give themapproval and that they 're nervous and selfconscious about the whole event . In other words , most guys come across asWUSSIES when they first approach women . On the other hand , the guys I know who are themost successful with women are the opposite . They 're totally cool , calm , and collected . Theyoften approach a woman and begin the conversationlike they would with an old friend . There is no apologetic body language , and thereare no signs of insecurity . They are n't there to find out if the woman isgoing to give them some approval ... on thecontrary , they are trying to find out if the womanmeets THEIR standards . Think about how you 'd act if you were onlyinterested in finding out if she 's the kind ofexceptional woman that you 're interested ingetting to know better , instead of being concernedabout whether or not she 's going to like you ... big shift , is n't it ? Now , here 's some homework for you : Sit down and think carefully about the mostcommon situations you find yourself in where yousee women that you 'd like to meet and talk to . Think about what 's going on in their minds , where they 're going , what they 've just done ... andwhat they 're about to do . Think about how they'reprobably feeling . Now , come up with 10 different ways that youcould start a conversation in this situation.Remember that YOU 'RE the one who is trying tofigure out if SHE is the kind of woman you 'd liketo get to know better . Once you 've come up with 10 good ones , pickyour favorite , and mentally rehearse it . I realize that I 'm asking you to do some workhere , but it 's sooooo worth it . I 'm going to give you one more hint ... Most of the guys I know who are great withwomen use the simplest of simple conversationstarters . `` Hi . '' `` What are you drinking ? '' `` Hi , are you from around here ? '' ... I realize that these sound simple , and theyare . But they 're so simple that they 're DISARMING.They do n't come across as canned `` pick up lines '' , and they help you figure out very quickly if thewoman you 're talking to is friendly . And remember , relaxed body language is Key ! the subject was how to apporach women",0

"does anyone know if my boss can fire me ? please see details ? i have been at my job since oct 07 2005 i have never called out or been late my wife is going to be having a baby on the 26th of this month i am going to need four days off from work to take care of our other baby can he fire me for taking this off ? Fathers are allowed to take paternity leave so I do n't think you can get fired . But , I am not sure about that . You can check with your state 's labor dept . to confirm this . Your boss might not like the fact that you will need 4 days off for paternity leave especially since you are a relatively new employee . You will probably not get paid since you most likely have n't accrued sick or vacation time . You should give your boss as much advance notice as you can so he can plan accordingly . If you work for a company that has a Human Resources Dept . you might want to check with them to see how many days you can take ( it may be more than 4 ) and whether you have any sick time that would pay you while your out . You can also go to www.laborlawtalk.com and see if you can get an answer to your paternity leave questions .",0

"if its zero degrees and tommorow its going to be twice as cold how cold will it be ? So it depends on whether your question is in Fahrenheit or Centigrade ( aka Celsius ) . If it is in degrees Fahrenheit you need to convert to Rankine , divide by two , and then convert back to Fahrenheit:0 Fahrenheit = 459.67 Rankine ; twice as cold = 229.835 Rankine ; 229.835 Rankine = -229.835 Degrees Fahrenheit which is your answer.If , however , you are for some reason using metric , then you convert Centigrade ( Celsius ) to Kelvin , Divide by two , and convert back to Centigrade.So : 0 Centigrade = 275.15K ; twice as cold = 136.575K , converting back to centigrade you get -136.575 Centigrade which is your answer utilizing metric units .",0

"Is ice made from a salt/water solution actually colder than just water ice ? If you put both solutions in the kitchen freezer would the salt ice be colder than the water one , or would the salt solution stay liquid ? If you were able to get the salt solution cold enough , it would freeze . However , if you put two ice trays side by side , one filled with water , the other filled with salt water , and chilled them to the point where both froze , the would both be the same temperature . However , once the cold was taken away , the salt solution would melt at a much lower temperature than the water only cubes.What salt does when added to water is decrease the temperature at which water will freeze -- as well as melt . How much the freezing/melting point is lowered depends on how much salt is added . The higher the concentration , the lower the freezing/melting point .",0

"important events during george washingtons presidency ? Key Event : America Signs Treaty with Tripoli.Some more Key Events in President George Washington 's Administration• Precedents -- -Washington established two main precedents : a cabinet and the two-year term.• Whiskey Rebellion , 1794 -- -Washington ordered 15,000 troops to Pennsylvania and crushed the first challenge to federal authority.• Farewell Address , 1796 -- -Washington warned against the evils of political parties and `` tangling alliances '' abroad . On April 30 , 1789 , George Washington , standing on the balcony of Federal Hall on Wall Street in New York , took his oath of office as the first President of the United States . `` As the first of every thing , in our situation will serve to establish a Precedent , '' he wrote James Madison , `` it is devoutly wished on my part , that these precedents may be fixed on true principles . '' Born in 1732 into a Virginia planter family , he learned the morals , manners , and body of knowledge requisite for an 18th century Virginia gentleman . He pursued two intertwined interests : military arts and western expansion . At 16 he helped survey Shenandoah lands for Thomas , Lord Fairfax . Commissioned a lieutenant colonel in 1754 , he fought the first skirmishes of what grew into the French and Indian War . The next year , as an aide to Gen. Edward Braddock , he escaped injury although four bullets ripped his coat and two horses were shot from under him . From 1759 to the outbreak of the American Revolution , Washington managed his lands around Mount Vernon and served in the Virginia House of Burgesses . Married to a widow , Martha Dandridge Custis , he devoted himself to a busy and happy life . But like his fellow planters , Washington felt himself exploited by British merchants and hampered by British regulations . As the quarrel with the mother country grew acute , he moderately but firmly voiced his resistance to the restrictions . When the Second Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia in May 1775 , Washington , one of the Virginia delegates , was elected Commander in Chief of the Continental Army . On July 3 , 1775 , at Cambridge , Massachusetts , he took command of his ill-trained troops and embarked upon a war that was to last six grueling years . He realized early that the best strategy was to harass the British . He reported to Congress , `` we should on all Occasions avoid a general Action , or put anything to the Risque , unless compelled by a necessity , into which we ought never to be drawn . '' Ensuing battles saw him fall back slowly , then strike unexpectedly . Finally in 1781 with the aid of French allies -- he forced the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown . Washington longed to retire to his fields at Mount Vernon . But he soon realized that the Nation under its Articles of Confederation was not functioning well , so he became a prime mover in the steps leading to the Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia in 1787 . When the new Constitution was ratified , the Electoral College unanimously elected Washington President He did not infringe upon the policy making powers that he felt the Constitution gave Congress . But the determination of foreign policy became preponderantly a Presidential concern . When the French Revolution led to a major war between France and England , Washington refused to accept entirely the recommendations of either his Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson , who was pro-French , or his Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton , who was pro-British . Rather , he insisted upon a neutral course until the United States could grow stronger . To his disappointment , two parties were developing by the end of his first term . Wearied of politics , feeling old , he retired at the end of his second . In his Farewell Address , he urged his countrymen to forswear excessive party spirit and geographical distinctions . In foreign affairs , he warned against long-term alliances . Washington enjoyed less than three years of retir",0

"how does computer work ? A computer is an information-processing machine that works by converting all kinds of information into binary numbers ( ones and zeros ) and then using simple mathematics to make decisions about , or to rearrange , those numbers . There are two things essential to understanding the basics of how a computer works . One is that a computer treats any type of information ( not only numbers but also letters , words , dates , and so on ) as if it consisted simply of binary ones and zeros . For example , a computer can translate the letter “ A ” typed into its keyboard into a string of ones and zeros , such as 1000001 . One reason to do this is that once in binary form , the information can be stored and moved about more easily .",0

NOw my doctor wants me to get back to the pill on a continuos scheme ( no pause ) to avoid getting my period and also pain .

If you are concerned about this , get a second opinion about your treatment.My notion is that if you do n't want to get pregnant , are sexually active , and want to avoid pain , its probably a good idea to take the birth control pills .

"What 's the best way to lose weight ? Start eating fruits such as pineapple , grape , pappaya , watermelon , mango , kiwi , strawberry etc as much as you want . Two hours later , eat a large salad with everything except meat , fish , or egg . Two hours after ( at least ) eat the dinner with your favarite meat , fish , etc . Do not go for seconds . Drink a glass of water just before eating the dinner , this will help you not to want to go for seconds , and using a small plate also will help . Drink 7 glasses of water all through out the day . One more thing do not eat anything three hours before going to sleep only water if the urge comes up.Keep doing this for a week , you will loose weight in a healthy way , and this will help you keep it off as well because you are eating everything you want to eat and you do not have the feeling of hunger or thirst . The fruits in the morning will help you to curb your need for eating all the time feeling for the rest of the day because it is natural sugarMake sure you do not eat for two hours after each meal and when you feel like eating something grab a glass of water . Replace your sugar drinks with water and after dinner you can have a glass of wine or beer as well.I tried every diet in the world and nothing worked and at 53 it worked and I am at 57 healthy and very energetic .",0

"How do you create HD 3D video games for the PS3 or XBox 360 ? It 's important that it 's HD . If possible , can youlist the name of software that helps ? I do n't know much about console programming.ALso , along with the software name , can you give me web sites that might help , and a number of the best programming languages . What you need is the SDK ( Software Development Kit ) for the particular console that you are developing for . Unfortunally these kits usually cost $ 10+ and even more unfortunally you ca n't get them . Most Console license holders ( like Microsoft or Sony ) will only lease a kit to you if you a big company with an active title in development and a published deal ready . It is almost impossible to get a kit if you are a single developer.I suggest making a PC game with DirectX , the directX SDK is free . It is a good place to get started and Microsoft 's Xbox uses a very similar almost identical interface . So if you can swing a publisher deal and convince Microsoft to let use use a SDK you wo n't have much trouble getting your game to work on the XBox.When you game is ready License holder will put your game through a set of rigorious tests to see if it is stable and conforms to all the rules of the particular system , if that all works out they will allow you to release the game.Almost every professional game with VERY few exceptions are written in C++.Compared to all this making the game work on a HD Televison is trival .",0

"What are the main aplications of `` Chaos Theory '' ? There have not been many direct applications of chaos theory so far , but the study of chaos and the emphasis on understanding chaos has given us new methods of research.One of the best examples I can think of is agent-based modelling in social sciences . For example , in theoretical combat , there is an old equation called Lanchester 's equation of combat , which predicts the casualty rate in a given time period for two different armies o fgiven sizes with given accuracies . Unfortunately , it tends not to be terribly accurate in numerical forescasts of battle outcomes . This is because the battle outcome depnds on the behavior of individual troops on the battlefield , and small changes in their behavior can cause big changes in battle outcome.The idea that small changes in an input cause big changes in an output is the essence of chaos theory . This has led to agent based modelling in which researchers assign behavioral attributes to individual troops rather than use a single variable to define a whole army . The computer calculates each troops interation with his own troops and with the enemy 's , and you get an outcome . Small changes in troop behavior will cause large changes in outcome . This can tell researchers what behaviors of soldiers may be most important to modify even slghtly.Observations of very different outcomes from small changes in starting conditions have led reserachers in all sorts of other fields to also attempt to understand this difference . Chemical engineers are often trying to understand tubulence and how small changes in pipe shapes can casue big changes in the way fluid flows .",0

what do you have to take to be a nurse ? in college Registered Nurses generally receive their basic preparation through one of three basic avenues : Graduation from an associate 's degree-granting nursing program ( approximately three years of college level study with a strong emphasis on clinical knowledge and skills ) earning the degree of ASN/AAS in Nursing.Graduation with a three-year ( diploma ) certificate from a hospital-based school of nursing ( non-degree ) .

"How do you like President Bush ? ? ? He 's a power hungry , cronyist puppet of the far right neocon movement . He 's a demagogue , and he is n't very smart . He thinks he 's above the law , he panders to the prevailing winds of evangelical Christianity even though the neoconservative movement stinks to Heaven of nihilism , egocentrism , atheism and cynicism.He is the choice of a party which tries to expound , at every opportunity , on the evils of big government and centralized social programs all while racking up a monsterous deficit on missile defense shields born of broken treaties . Upon breaking our nuclear proliferation treaties , we wonder why rogue nations in the rest of the world want to do the same . His spendthrift attitude is causing inflation , and it 's crowding much needed private investment out of our manufacturing sector . His failure to enforce the laws which keep the capitalist system of this country running have led to price gouging of fuels , and that 's compounding our economic troubles . Under his administration , we have made several cuts to energy subsidies for the poor ( which he promised not to do while campaigning ) , and in the face of his carefree attitude towards the illegal activities of the oil companies , people have frozen to death in their homes.The manufacturing in the military-industrial sector combined with a purely reactionary attitude towards environmentalism has led to a toxic level of perchlorates in the breast milk of almost ALL of the women tested for it . We ca n't even set up a control group because everyone is so laden with perchlorates . Perchlorates cause brain damage in nursing children.His budgets allocate federal funds for private , religious organizations.In violation of the due process of the law and our long held principles which prohibit unlawful search and seazure , he has the NSA spy on Americans and subpeonas search engines to find out what everyone in the country is searching for.He abandons science in favor of ideology . He refuses to heed the warnings of climatologists . His hostile attitude towards medicine and biology is threatening the very foundations of American industry , innovation and science . His cronies are trying to censor and suppress scientific journals which give sound evidence to something that should be intuitively obvious -- logging does n't help forests recover from forest fire.He was an alcoholic and a cokehead until he was 40 . His `` choice '' to become President was made when , according to him , he realized that he `` was 40 and wondering what to do with his life . '' He is in office only because Americans have strayed so far from their liberal founding principles that they would rather see a dynastic succession of aristocracy than a government of scholars and public servants.He abandoned Afghanistan , where the terrorists were and are , to take us to war in Iraq , where they are n't . He lied to do this . After doing that , his administration gave no-bid contracts to Halliburton , whose former CEO is now your vice-president . The price of doing this is that we are now unable to deal with a growing threat in Iran , and while only a few years ago we were berating the international community and the UN Security Council , the best we can now manage is to threaten to refer Iran to the UN Security Council.Under his administration , we have begun to use the CIA to fly people who are only suspected of something to old Soviet facilities where we torture them . We hold people for long periods of time without charging them with a crime.He pushed an energy bill through congress which relaxes the efficiency requirements for coal burning power plants .

"'NASTERDAM ' who is this man ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Born in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in the south of France in December 1503 , Michel de Nostredame was the son of a grain dealer who was also a prosperous home-grown notary . His family was originally Jewish , but had converted to Catholicism during the previous century along with thousands of others , due to increasing official French persecution of Jews , many of whom were the descendants of former refugees from Spain , where they were known as the Marranos . The names of Nostredame 's known forebears seem to reflect this . While practice of the ancestral religion was often apparently continued in secret , nobody knows whether this applied to Nostredame 's family , or whether it still applied to him two generations later . ( It should be noted that the majority of Jews at the time frowned upon such 'cover conversions ' , not least because succeeding generations of offspring were inevitably more at risk to lose connection with their past , and thus with their roots and religion . ) His adult religious leanings suggest , however , that his upbringing was devoutly Catholic.This apart , nothing is known about his childhood , but at the age of fifteen he entered the University of Avignon to study for his baccalaureate . After little more than a year he was forced by the plague to leave again . In 1529 , after some years as an apothecary , he entered the University of Montpellier to study for a doctorate in medicine , but was promptly expelled again when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary , which was a 'manual ' trade expressly banned by the university statutes . He then continued work as an apothecary ( though some of his publishers and correspondents would later call him 'Doctor ' ) , and created a `` rose pill '' that was widely believed to protect against the the plague.In 1531 he was invited by Jules-César Scaliger , a leading Renaissance man , to come to Agen . There Nostradamus married a woman whose name is still in dispute ( possibly Henriette d'Encausse ) , but who bore him two children . In 1534 , however , his wife and children died , presumably from the plague . After their death he continued to travel , passing through France and possibly Italy.He settled down in 1547 in Salon-de-Provence , where he married a rich widow named Anne Ponsarde Gemelle and eventually had six children – three daughters and three sons . After a further visit to Italy , he began to move away from medicine and towards the occult . He wrote an almanac for 1550 , for the first time Latinising his name to 'Nostradamus ' , and was so encouraged by its success that he decided to write one or more annually . Taken together , they are known to have contained at least 6338 prophecies ( most of them , in the event , failed predictions – see Chevignard and Lemesurier ( 2 ) under Sources ) , as well as at least 11 annual calendars , all of them starting on 1st January and not , as is sometimes supposed , in March . He then began his project of writing 1,000 quatrains , which form the supposed prophecies for which he is famous today . Feeling vulnerable to religious fanatics , however , he devised a method of obscuring his meaning by using `` Virgilianised '' syntax , word games and a mixture of languages such as Provençal , Greek , Latin and Italian . For technical reasons connected with their publication in three instalments , the last 58 quatrains of the seventh 'Century ' , or book of 100 verses , did not survive into any extant edition.The quatrains , written in a book titled `` Les Propheties '' , received a mixed reaction when they were published . Some people thought Nostradamus was a servant of evil , a fake , or insane , while many of the elite thought his quatrains were spiritually inspired prophecies . Soon nobility were coming from far and wide to receive horoscopes and advice from him , though he normally expected them to supply the birthcharts on which they were based .

They were expelled from Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella and moved eastwrd to Greece , Turkey , the Balkans , and other lands . They spoke an archaic Spanish which later became Ladino .

"okay so I have this b/f & I like him & everything but there 's this other guy who 's really cute & I like him so my b/f he 's a 9th grader & i 'm a 10th grader this other guy I talk to him on the phone & at school sometimes he 's really cool and he really wants to get to know me and actually I want to get to know him to , there 's just that one problem w/my b/f who I do like but ... ... so , please what should I do ? If you 're thinking about other guys when you have a boyfriend , then you 're obviously not that `` into '' him .

"do u think that lies saves u from bein ur self ? I do n't think I would use the word 'saves ' . I 'll ignore your grammar and spelling and whatnot and try to answer what I think you might be asking.To say that lies 'save ' you from being yourself implies that you do n't like who you are and that you think that the fabrications are better than reality . In fact , it 's the opposite . Lies , if you tell them often , do separate you from who you really are in that they are false , and provide the one you 're lying to with a false impression of you . They tend to amalgamate until you 're boxed in by your own stories . They start to add up and keeping them all straight is difficult , and there are almost always discrepancies . If you lie too much , it can make people hate you for deceiving them . If there 's something you do n't like about your life , so much as to lie about it , then I would suggest changing who you are instead . Fix it , and then you can be honest with everyone , yourself included.However , if you must lie , I would stay as absolutely close to the truth as possible . It makes them that much more believable .",0
"How did language start ? Especially the English language.. who define the ABCDE ... . Language predates the alphabet . The origins of Language are lost to the mists of time . The alphabet as we know it was developed by the Phonecians about 3000 years ago , and modified first by the Greeks , and then the Romans for their own languages before we adopted it from the Romans.The origins of the English language specifically date to sometime after 1066 when Willam the Conqueror became King of England . The commoners spoke something related to the ancestor language of Dutch while the nobility spoke French . We kept the grammar of the native Anglo-Saxon tongue while adding huge amounts of French vocabulary.The result is recognizably English , while still sounding very different from what we speak today . It 's not until Shakespear 's time that Modern English emerged .",0

"What is a post-masters graduate certificate ? I have found a school that offers a post-masters graduate certificate . They say it is almost as good as a PHD . Any suggestions The post-masters graduate certificate is a degree level that is intermediate between the masters degree and the doctorate . It became popular in education careers where promotions or job grades depended in part on educational level . They recognized this `` sixth year '' degree level as one year of study beyond the master 's degree . You also sometimes see it referred to as a `` specialist 's '' degree because some of the early post-masters degrees were Educational Specialist ( Ed.S . ) degrees . Other common names are Certificate of Advanced Study or Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study . The utility of the post-masters certificate depends on what field you are in and why you want the degree . Some fields of study have the specialist level as the entering level for certification or licensure ( school psychology , for example ) , in which case you would find it vital . Some fields ( counseling , for example ) might have the level of training required for licensure at the equivalent of the post-masters certificate level ( 60 semester hours ) in which case having the certificate would be an advantage if you want to get licensed . Some fields allow you to specialize after taking a post masters certificate ( i.e . Infant Mental Health Nursing ) in which case the certificate is very useful . On the other hand , some fields really require a doctorate ( most college teaching , for example ) in which case the post-masters certificate , while good to have , wo n't fulfil the occupational requirement.I think the post-masters certificate is nice if you are working toward continuing education as it can help you make a more systematic study in your area of interest , and it appears that you have met a more unified goal than just taking courses.Hope this helps .",0

"This is question for science lovers ? If you dig a hole right through the earth along its diameter & drop a ball in the hole , what will be the motion shown by the ball ? This could not be done on earth because of its liquid core , but perhaps it could be done on the solid moon.At the surface of the earth , a ball ( let 's say of lead ) would have a potential energy ( PE - energy of position ) relative to the center of gravity at the center of the earth . As the ball is released into the theoretical hole , it would accelerate ( like dropping it into a well ) and some of the PE would be converted to kinetic energy ( KE - energy of motion ) . Because energy can neither be created nor destroyed , as the ball drops its speed increases and it has more KE but less PE . The ball will continue to accelerate until it reaches the center of the earth but with less attraction from the earth 's gravitational field because more and more of the earth 's mass is now above ( or behind ) it . At the very center of the earth the ball would have maximum KE but minimum PE . Passing the center the process is reversed and the ball slows as it reaches the other side of the earth 's surface , all the while reconverting KE to PE . At the opposite surface the ball would have maximum PE ( equal to the original PE but of opposite sign ( say - instead of + ) .The process could repeat forever if there is no wind resistance ( perfect vacuum - like on the moon ) and the hole was perfectly smooth exerting no friction as the earth spins on its axis constantly touching the ball to the sides of the hole.Of course this must be a mental exercise ; but it is an interesting demonstration of physics and energy conversion in particular . Good luck .",0

"How deep can a scuba diver descend before encountering a dangerous level of pressure ? Is there a way this is calculated ? If so , how ? The main dangers a suba diver are subjected to dealing with depth are not just because of pressure , but because of the pressure of Nitrogen or Oxygen in the lungs.Too much nitrogen forced into the blood causes nitrogen narcosis , which is like being drugged by a narcotic . How deep you go depends on how the percentage of nitrogen in your air and how long you are down.Too mush Oxygen forced into the blood is toxic , and can directly cause brain damage or death . Again , how deep you go depends on the percentage of oxygen in the tank and how long you are going to be down.http : //www.scubadiving.com/training/specialty_and_advanced/what % 27s_in_your_tank % 3f/Finally , the more air that gets dissolved in you blood , the more at risk you are of having the air boil out of your blood as you come back to the surface ( this is called the bends ) and is also very dangerous . SCUBA diver have tables or dive computers that let them know , based on how deep they have been and for how long , whether they are at risk of getting the bends and if so , how slowly they need to come up in order to let the gases gradually go back out of the blood and into the lungs.With helium and ( small amount of ) oxygen in a tank , Mark Ellyatt dived to 313 m ( 1025 feet ) . http : //www.inspired-training.com/depth_record.htmThe depth limit for a Los Angeles class nuclear submarine is only 950 feet.http : //www.navsource.org/archives/08/08688.htm",0

"why does society say the skinnier you are , the prettier and more accepted you will be ? I think it 's based off of society valuing what influential and rich people that they iconize look like . The `` elite '' have the time and resources to devote to looking their `` best '' and usually that best is the opposite of what the average person in society looks like.In the US it 's hard to stay fit because most of us do n't have jobs that keep us physically fit ( or in the case of kids , they do n't `` get out and play '' as much as they used to ) . Also the cheapest food that is available is the worst for you but is the highest quantity that most people in the US consume which leads to so many people being overweight . So the opposite ( being skinny ) is what 's idolized . Mostly it 's wealthy people who have time to excersize and `` personal trainers '' and such to help them stay fit ... the rest of us are on our own.Back a few hundred years ago , if you were overweight it was a major status symbol because adequate nutrition was hard to come by , and if you had enough food to be fat , you must have been really well off . Again , what was attractive was the opposite of the average person who had to work hard at manual labor and probably did n't get enough to eat and so was skinny.Tanning is another example ... a while ago it was considered unattractive because if you were tanned it meant you were some serf working outside all day instead of being able to stay inside away from the sun . Now it 's the wealthy that have the most leisure time to spend outdoors so tanning is what 's considered attractive .",0

"How can you ? how can you tell that chlorine is a gas at room temperature ? Well , do you know about intermolecular forces ? There are four types of intermolecular forces : 1 . London dispersion2 . Dipole-dipole3 . Hydrogen bonding4 . Ion-dipoleThe weakest of these four forces is the first one , London dispersion , which happens to be the only one that chlorine molecules exert on each other . Chlorine molecules ( Cl2 ) are diatomic and nonpolar ( two identical atoms bonded together can not have polarity because they pull on the electrons with the same strength ) . That means that they only exert London dispersion forces on each other , which is weak . That means that chlorine molecules are n't really attached to each other that well , so they can just fly away from each other as gas very easily . This is why chlorine is a gas at room temperature , and that 's how you can tell ( or at least make a smart prediction ; it 's hard to know for sure ) with chlorine and other molecules and compounds . Figure out what kind of intermolecular forces you 're dealing with .",0

"Would you ever want to attend the Super Bowl ? Why or why not ? I most likely would never want to attend the Super Bowl for three reasons . First , the cost . The cost of one Super Bowl ticket is expensive and with the money that I could pay for one Super Bowl ticket , I could purchase a High Definition Television . Second , I would have to deal with a lot of crowds at the event . Although it would be a dream to attend the Major League Baseball All-Star Game but with the Super Bowl , you have to get to the game early and there is going to be more people attending a Super Bowl than a baseball All-Star Game . Finally , it might be more expensive to attend at Super Bowl after you pay for accommodations for about three day and attending all the Super Bowl events that the host city has to offer . If I ever did want to attend the Super Bowl , I would like to see the Super Bowl in Detroit , Atlanta , Chicago , and in Cleveland . Yes if the Redskins were in it .",0
how to subtract using the left-over or add-on method ? There are many ways . For example to subtract 9 from 14 we add 1 to each number and then subtract . 15-10=5.Another way is to add numbers to 9 till we get 14.9+1=10 ; 10+4=14 ; and the answer is 1+4=5 . Another way is to subtract more than the number to be subtracted and add the excess . Subtract 10 instead of 9 from 14 to get 4 . Having subtracted 1 in excess we add 1 to 4 to get 5 .,0

"What is the best diet pill for weight loss ? Good question . I will answer by first saying that diet pills are a fraud . Any pill that says you can lose weight by taking it and doing nothing else is wrong.Losing weight is not losing weight if you put it back on . That ’ s what diet pills do , why do you think there is a new popular one every few months.Now if you wonder if there are any good supplements and my answer is yes.There are some supplements that you can take that can enhance a very healthy diet and fitness program and help you to stay committed to it . 7 Keto is an awesome metabolic enhancing compound that helps to reduce body weight and body fat by giving you more of a hormone that tells your thyroid to increase your metabolism . You may say wow , that ’ s what I need . No , the 7-Keto is all you need , not the other stuff . Yes but no , see the body can only take so much of it at a time before its eliminated by the blood and the rest becomes expensive urine . So you cant just take it alone , it must be part of a plan.Hoodia appears to affect the brain by making the stomach feel full and reducing the desire to eat . Offers safe , caffeine-free , non-stimulant weight management support . It also may help in metabolizing fats.Multivitamins - help you maintain the muscle that you have by providing nutrients your cells need . Understand if you don ’ t put enough nutrients in your body , you will lose muscle because your body will eat the muscle for those nutrients.These supplements should be part of an overall lifestyle change , to a healthier one.There are 5 most important things that must go together in any workout program . These are part of changing your complete lifestyle to one that is healthier . They also help you to naturally optimize your metabolism . The faster your metabolism the better your body uses your food for energy , instead of storing it as fat . I put them in the order of importance.1 . Eat more . Yes eat more . More meals that is . It is best to eat a small meal every 3-4 hours . The meal should be just large enough to where you are not hungry , as opposed to eating you are full . There is a difference . Eating 1 or 2 meals a day slows your metabolism down . You should have at least 4-6 meals a day . For most people , your food should be balanced between carbs proteins and fats in a 50-25-25 ratio . Throughout your day you should maintain this ratio 2 . Drink more water . Most of us don ’ t have enough water . This means our bodies are dehydrated . Two things a dehydrated body has trouble doing , one is releasing water . In order to lose fat you must be able to release water , because fat cells in your body are composed of mostly water . A dehydrated body can not build very well . Muscle tone indicates a constant building state in your body . If your body isn ’ t building that means it is losing muscle and it ’ s never good to lose muscle that slows your metabolism and makes you look flabby.3 . Maintain a balanced workout regimen of cardio and resistance ( weights ) . Cardio is good for fat burning and it ’ s easy to do and to progress yourself . Resistance is a little harder because it ’ s not as easy to know what to do . If weights aren ’ t your thing then try Yoga or Pilates . Both are very effective resistance and core training and can help you maintain lean muscle and increase your overall metabolism.4 . Smart supplementation of your diet is your best solution to making sure you get the nutrients your food doesn ’ t give you . I mentioned 7-Keto , Hoodia , and a multivitamin plus cleanse formulas , as well as detox formulas are awesome for eliminating toxins we take into our bodies without knowing.5 . Sleep is a very important part of any healthy lifestyle regimen . When we sleep our bodies and minds refresh themselves and allow us to function at an optimal level . Sleeping allows muscles to rebuild themselves and when they do that , it speeds your metabolism.You may ask why I gave you this long list instead of just telling you what exercises",0

"whats the most effective treatment to kill lice eggs ? killing the bugs has n't been the problem those eggs are.I just want her hair pretty and shiney again and for this problem gone for good .I know to wash everything and to spray bedding and furniture.Thanks The problem is that you ca n't kill the eggs . The nits are encased in a very strong type substance that can not be penetrated . The most important thing is to retreat the hair after 7 to 10 days and you HAVE to get all the nits out by hand or by comb . I find those plastic combs ineffective . I ordered a metal comb called medi comb from a dealer on ebay . It works the best but you will still need to hand pick some . They are such a pain ! Also using hair styling products ( after hair is nit/lice free ) daily helps prevent reinfestation from contant with others ( at school/bus/etc. ) . I also flat iron/or hot iron curl her hair at times or braid it . Anything that keeps it back or helps to kill those pests ! Also watch closely the friends they play with and if you see any kind of scratching check the child immediately and send them home to tell their parents if you find any nits or anything . Check over the ears and nape of the neck . Also they do make lice repellent spray that you can order ( search online ) it 's mostly tea tree oil , eucalyptus , geranium , and other essential oils mixed with water but it could help if your child is in close proximity of other children and lice is a reoccurring problem . Prevention is the best medicine .",0
"What are modern japanese attitudes toward suicide ? Suicide has been a very serious issue in Japan . There are many school kids ( not many but some ) committing suicide .

Also , there are many office workers in their middle age around 40 yrs old committing suicide . They are also usually very tired and stressed out under a great pressure at work . The trains in Tokyo often stop and delay because of the suicidal accidents . Workers commuting to work just get so depressed and there are ppl who just jump in to the rail while the train is coming . There are more and more help lines that they can call for help and talk to counselars . Like in high school , the school provides students listing of help lines . Teachers are pretty concerned about bullying at school . So Japaneses are very sensitive about suicide nowadays .",0

'Charging ' up a conductor may transfer charge to it , but it will easily 'conduct ' it away from itself.The plastic rod wo n't conduct , so as charge is transferreed to it , the charge is sort of trapped on the rod , and builds until a noticeable static charge builds .",0

"An ounce of high grade pot can have a street value higher than an ounce of gold . Why not legalize and tax ? It is less harmful than liquor and tobbacco . I could not possibly agree more with you . People are so reluctant to legalize marijuana because it has such a bad reputation . Of course , it gets that reputation because it is illegal and people pass judgment on it based solely on that fact . If you stop looking at the actual legality of it and just think about it morally it is a vice no worse than many others that americans find perfectly acceptable . Anything can be abused . People abuse alcohol , cigarettes , fast food , gambling and countless things which are perfectly legal and socially acceptable , but somehow so many people think smoking weed is just wrong.I can hardly see how continuing to make it illegal will benefit anyone . It only allows drug dealers to set the standards of production/regulation etc . all the while evading taxes . Making it illegal probably does not really curtail the use of the drug either . Did prohibition curtail the use of alcohol ? nope . did it increase crime ? yes.Legalize it and regulate it . Everyone wins . The potheads wo n't have to worry about getting locked up . The government can make some more cash . And we wo n't continue to whaste our time prosecuting potheads and enforcing rediculous laws that combat marijuana use at the expense of taxpayer 's dollars.aside from these reasons , weed just is n't that bad . It is not physically addictive ( as is alcohol/tobacco ) , it does not have the reputation of making people violent/abusive ( as does alcohol ) , it is not as closely associated with recklessness ( as is alcohol ) and when was the last time you threw up or had a hangover from smoking some weed ? never.Legalize it ! !",0

"how to increase self-esteem or confidence if you have acne scars and your classmates do n't have ? can you help me ? First recognize its not your fault . Its what makes you unique . You 're not sub-par , or defective , or less than others because you do n't have smooth flawless skin . You are different , but just as good . You still are beautiful/attractive . And others will think so too.Be happy . Have a pretty smile . Walk with confidence , knowing that you are beautiful/attractive . Focus on making others feel good about themselves . That 's really attractive . Walk with your head high . Shoulders back . Look at others in their eyes . Speak loud and clear . Smile often . Fake confidence until you feel it . At the same time , take good care of yourself , so that you can be your very best . Eat right . Drink plenty of water . Take vitamins . Get 8 hours sleep . Determine allergens , and eliminate them . ( I was seriously allergic to bleach , and it cause huge breakouts on my face ) Be proactive in treating your problems . Try products to help acne scars . ProActiv is very good on acne . But is you have deep scars , you need to resurface your skin . Try Obagi products . They work so well . You have to get them from a doctor or cosmetic surgen , and they are expensive , ( about $ 300 for about 3 months worth of supplies , after the initial kit , you just replace what you need at about $ 45 a month ) , but you 'll see beautiful skin . If you still feel down about yourself , try a bottle of the herb St. John 's Wort . You can buy it at Walmart . Its a mood elevator . It raises your melatonin and seratin levels and makes you feel better , so you can focus on the important things . Non-adddictive , and safe to use . Then do something that makes you feel proud of yourself . Stop doing things that you know are wrong . Set high goals . Volunteer . Teach a Sunday School class . Tutor children to read . Be nice to your family . Do other things to make you feel good about yourself . Your self esteem should be based on who you ARE and what you give to society . You want to look your best , and it makes you feel good , but your looks should NOT be the foundation of your self-esteem . How shallow is that ? And lastly , realize it could be a whole lot worse .

Or would it be all of those 3 ? increasing thickness , decreasing temperature , and decreasing length would all reduce the resistance of a metal wire . so the only thing that reduces it by increasing is thickness.a good way to remember this is just to reason it out . if the wire is thicker , current can move more freely and with less resistance then a thinner , more constricted wire . the electrons in the current would have more space to move around . if you increase temperature , it would cause more resistance , because with temperature , comes heat , and heat just makes more resistance . lower temperatures allow the current to move more freely , which is why superconductors work really well at low temperatures . and length , well the longer the wire is , the more the resistance is going to build up along the whole thing ... the electrons are just encountering more resistance because the wire is longer..",0

"When people talk about their `` relationship '' with Jesus , what exactly do they mean ? By characterizing one 's faith in Christ as having a relationship with him , a person implies that that there is an ongoing dialog of sorts ( perhaps non-verbal ) between the believer and the Lord.I mean , if you 've been touched in some way by Jesus once in your life , would n't it be more accurately characterized as an encounter , or an introduction ? Perhaps even an acquaintance ? I recently went to a Starbucks in an unfamiliar town . I paid the girl behind the counter $ 1.70 for my cup of coffee , and left . I do n't believe I will ever see her again . Does that mean I have a `` relationship '' as well ? And if you 've maintained ongoing contact with Jesus , then certainly , you would have sufficient personal experience with your savior to no longer characterize your beliefs as `` faith . '' After all this contact with the Lord , should n't you regard it as `` fact ? `` Just wondering ... It is okay if you think I am nuts but here goes.I talk to God by prayer , sometimes silently and sometimes outloud . God talks to me occassionaly at His time frame , In other words I do n't have to be in a prayerful or spiritual mood for Him to speak . I can not explain it but when He speaks to me , it is not silent in my head and it is not audible so that others can hear it but it is clearly audible to me.So yes , I have a relationship with Him . I also can feel His prescense in my life.Look to John 8:47 , & 10:26-30 Jesus stated my sheep hear my voice and they know me ( Jesus ) and follow me . God may not communicate with everyone the same as He does with me but if you do not hear His voice in some manner then you do n't know Him . My relationship with Him indeed started out as faith but you are correct in the change that takes place . I can not prove this relationship to anyone but to me it is fact . You can not achieve fact without first having faith .",0

"Are Space and Time continuous or are them quantized ? There are two major theories of modern physics : Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity . Both work well , with QM being applicable to atomic and smaller sizes , and GR to large ( Solar size , galaxy size , etc . ) things.The major question in physics today is : how do we combine QM and GR so that they are two aspects of one larger theory . This postulated theory is usually called a Unified Theory or Theory of Everything or something like that . String theories are attempts to do this ( so far all are still incomplete ) .The major difference between QM and GR is that nn QM energy comes in discrete levels ( all way to small for us to notice ) . However in GR space-time is continious . So it is not instantly clear whether space-time is continous or quantized in a unified theory.For consistency between these space quantization would have to be on extremely small scales . This would almost certain occur ( if it did ) at distances called the Planck length , which is ~ 10^-33 cm . ( This is about one billion trillion times smaller than an atomic nucleus . ) Quantization of time would then be the interval for light to cross this distance , about 10^-43 seconds . It is because of a lack of a unified theory that physicists ca n't say anything about the conditions of the universe before 10^-43 seconds after the Big Bang . ( Of course that is still pretty good . ) The short answer is : no one knows , but the scale of quantization would have to be much , much smaller than any known elementary particle .",0

"What kind of lies did the Ku Klux Klan tell ? An why did people go along with it for so long ? There are so many articles about the Klu Klux Klan that it boggles the mind . In a nutshell they - like Nazi Germany - beleived that the white race was omnipotent and that all other races are/were subservient or corrupt in some manner . Therefore they agreed that by process of elimination , they would rule as the all powerful white race . This misguided belief was fueled in part by the rife prejudices in the southern parts of the US . Since they beleived that blacks and other races were not in their white power plan , and these races were no better than dogs and should be treated as such , they proceeded with a process called culling . This is where they mistakenly thought that they could rule society and that everyone would go along with their beliefs . They used the bible and twisted its teachings to enforce their beliefs . A lot of people went along with it , in part , because of the slavery and its abolition in later years , but also because it was the `` Christian '' thing to do . Some thought that if they were true christians they had to go along with it , because they beleived the words of the Grand wizard . The Klu Klux Klan was a secret society for a long time . Mostly joined by angry white southern gentlemen who didnt like the abolition of slavery . I use the term gentlemen loosely . If you google the name it will come up and you can read all about it..",0

"Does anyone know who William Tyndale was ? Info from Wikipedia : William Tyndale ( sometimes spelled Tindale ) ( ca.1484 - October 6 , 1536 ) was a 16th century priest and scholar who translated the Bible into the Early Modern English of his day . Although numerous partial and complete English translations had been made from the 7th century onward , Tyndale 's was the first to take advantage of the new medium of print , which allowed for its wide distribution . Later , in October 1536 , he was killed by strangulation and then burned at the stake.Much of Tyndale 's works eventually found its way to the King James Version , which , though the work of 54 independent scholars , is based primarily on Tyndale 's translations.For more information follow this link : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tyndale",0

Yes , the books have descriptions of witchcraft . And yes , witchcraft is a sin . But why has this sin been singled out ? Lots of Christians watch movies and read books with cursing and extra-marital sex , and they 're certainly no more `` edifying '' than witchcraft .",0

"we need more things to show awereness for autism ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ? we have all kind of famous people doing stuff for cancer aids stim cell research why can some one do some for autism ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I think there is a lot of awareness that there is a thing called autism . But people are woefully ignorant of what autism is like . I know I 've mentioned that my niece has autism & people have said things like `` Have you ever taken her to Las Vegas ? '' Then I have to explain that `` Rain Man '' was FICTION ! Even though the character was inspired by some real people , Hollywood got a hold of the script & had to exsagerate . And `` Autism '' can mean so many things , too . One of the questions here included a description of `` geeks watching Star Trek '' as autism . I guess they were refering to Aspergers . When I hear people saying things like `` Autism does n't need treatment or a cure '' I ca n't help but think they must be refering to Aspergers.Then there 's strict autsim . My brother would keep his baseball mitt mearby for when his daughter would have fits . He 'd use it to `` catch '' her head as she was trying to bang it on tables , walls , or the floor . Thankfully , she does n't do that anymore & she 's finally out of diapers ( at age 8 ) but hardly has any words . She can understand a lot , but ca n't color in the lines , much less , write ! Sometimes I think it is a mistake classifying Aspergers & `` strict '' autism under the same umbrella of `` Autism Spectrum Disorders . ''",0

In Europe underfunded schools focus on Math and English , all else is sacrificed before these . However it appears social studies and other non-critical courses continue regardless of overall funding . ( 3 ) You must stream kids based on skills . It is ludicrous to think a `` no child is left behind '' system will work , a more apt name would be `` no child allowed to get ahead '' .Beyond this , I would suggest , get parents out of the class room , ( no idea why this is thought to be a good idea in the US ) and bring back discipline .",0

"How do you configure a tunnel ? I want to create a secure tunnel between two sites . They both have internet access and fixed IP adresses . What hardware and configuration do I need ? Thanks for your help Hey ! Great question ... What you are referring to is a VPN . Typically a VPN consists of a minimum of 2 pieces of hardware , configured to accept each other 's incoming traffic and ( un ) encrypt that traffic . If you do NOT already have a firewall on both ends now is the time to get them ! A good firewall will provide adequate , secure VPN services as well as NAT/PAT/etc.There are so many brands and feature sets I wo n't recommend a particular one . However , the first things you need to do are:1 ) Become familiar with what a VPN does exactly ( look at Cisco 's site for a really good primer ) 2 ) Decide what you want to do with the VPN . If you are looking at just accessing e-mail or simple file transfers that 's great . But if you want to get into running applications ( such as accessing an Access MDB ) over the VPN I think you will be quite disappointed . This is , of course , all dependent on your connection speed.3 ) Research some hardware by looking at both Professional and User reviews ( but remember to take them with a grain of salt ) ( Check out CNET.COM for hardware reviews ) . Be sure to pay particular attention to the type of encryptions it is capable of using . If you can , get 3DES encryption as it is the current industry standard and is relatively quick so it wo n't impact performance.4 ) Determine your budget for both ends , and do n't forget to include installation costs if necessary for the other end from where you are ( if you ca n't get there easily ) Also , if you have dedicated Internet connections ( such as Frame Relay or other type of T-1 ) you can call your ISP and ask if they sell a firewall/VPN package that works with your current connection.I just got through setting up a new VPN for my business so I could work from home , and with a T-1 circuit it 's pretty slow . So we use a Remote Control package on dedicated PC 's to do most of the work . This way only screen shots , keyboard and mouse controls are being passed . Not only is it blazing fast , but the remote control software adds an additional layer of encryption to the data being passed . Nothing like encrypting your data 5 seperate times for security ! Good look , and welxome to the world of VPN 's !",0

"What is the easiest way to get my wife a visa for entry to america ? If you are a US citizen and she is outside the US , you should apply for a K visa .

You should include some information that proves your relationship with her is not a fraudulent one , like pictures of your wedding , a letter explaining how you met and dated and why you decided to marry . Especially helpful are any children you have together or financial documents in both names . After she is here , she can apply for her permanent residence . I would suggest an attorney for that process because it involves a lot of paperwork , some of which is a bit complicated .",0
"What kind of psychotherapy works the best ? The answer to your question is not easy . Some therapists use a limited approach ( ie . only interpersonal , focused on your relationships with others . ) In my opinion , CBT ( Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy ) is often successful if other approaches have failed . I am the maintainer of a portal called http : //health.wikispaces.com that is helping to answer ( I hope ) precisely these kinds of questions . It is Invitation-Only , so that it is not open to misinformation . ( people who can access the site can also edit it to add their own research , and experiences . ) The answer to your question is that depending on the reason you are seeking psychotherapy , different methods will work best.I think this is really a multistep question , so I am going to give you some sources of information and then ask you to come back for a follow-up.WebMD.com , using experts from the Cleveland clinic ( WebMD uses different sources , some of which are not very comforting ) , has a detailed article on psychotherapy I highly recommend : http : //www.webmd.com/content/article/60/67128.htmI am going to add to this . The first thing you should discuss with any therapist is what brought you to see them , and what your goals are , and also billing . Insurance will often cover up to a certain amount ; some therapists or social workers ( both do therapy to some degree ) work on a sliding pay scale ( ie . they negociate on rate you pay . ) http : //www.webmd.com/content/article/60/67128.htmMy local counselor here at Earlham College in Richmond , IN says that eclectic therapists are the best -- ie . the ones that can use any approach that seems helpful . ( She has a Masters in Social Work . ) Therapists vary . Some are really good and give you specific directed guidance . Techniques are being researched all the time . I just saw a really good article on 'resellience therapy ' which sounded really cool .

Call her and ask her if she might want to get some tea or coffee or lunch or something . Do n't admit to what you did and at the same time do n't deny it either . Denying it will cause distrust on her part because she believes you did what ever it is you did n't do . That is what I would do . You are marrying her son .

"Which religion preaches most hatred & violence ? please Be honest and speak out even if it is ur own religion. ? All religions resort to hatred and violence . It just happens that Islam is the one doing it now . Christianity used to be the evil one , killing people who did n't `` believe '' for political reasons , invading the `` holy land '' for power grabs . Even today , Christianity still uses hatred for its unifying effect , labelling gays as evil , vile sinners - any religion gets stronger when it devises a common enemy . Religion is simply a way to control people , so violence and hatred go hand in hand with this - if you want to strengthen your hold on people , give them a common enemy - then they 'll do anything you ask . Works for Islam , works for Christianity .",0

"um..i got ta queston ? does anyone know of any kind of product , thats not that expensive for acne . Because i 've tried several different things , but they do n't want to seem to work . Okay 1. what causes acne ? 2.what should I use to clear it ? hormonesFor most people with acne , it begins at puberty . This is when the body starts to produce hormones called androgens . Androgens cause the enlargement and overstimulation of the sebaceous glands in people with acne . Sensitivity to these androgens also cause acne to appear during the menstrual cycle and sometimes in pregnancy . The extra sebum ( oil ) that the sebaceous glands produce mixes with dead skin cells and bacteria on the skin 's surface and this blocks pores . Inside the blocked pore , bacteria multiply and cause inflammation leading to the spots and pustules associated with acne.stressStress can also cause the production of hormones , such as cortisol , which can aggravate acne.other causes * Acne is often genetic * Some medications and steroids * Heavy or oily make up * Over abrasive cleansing o Astringent facial products can dry the skin out causing the body to create even more sebum to compensate o Use of harsh exfoliators can damage existing spots and spread infection o Picking or squeezing of blackheads , whiteheads and spots can send the infection deeper into the skin and cause scarring * A diet high in foods that can aggravate acneou really can get rid of acne , naturally . How ? By learning about the causes of acne and how to rebalance the body . By understanding that applying harsh chemicals to the skin can actually exacerbate the skin 's natural oil production and make acne worse . Why is it that people who do n't eat a Western diet do n't have acne ? You , too , can get rid of acne by understanding why it 's predominantly a Western problem . In parts of the world where a Western diet is being adopted , they are now getting acne.Our bodies are fine-tuned machines , continually creating new cells and getting rid of dead cells . There are three processes vital to human health ; appropriation ( taking in food , air , water etc ) , assimilation ( absorbing nutrients to create new cells ) and elimination ( expelling waste/toxins ) . If any one of these is unbalanced , this can lead to less than vital health . We need to take in the right fuel , use it effectively and get rid of by-products and waste . For example , we get rid of waste via the digestive system , the lungs and the skin ; if the digestive system is sluggish waste may have to be expelled via the skin as blocked pores and acne .",0

"Why is DSL never available in my area ? Why is DSL never available in my area ?

"when was the first time that butterfly stroke was done swimming ? Would like to know the first time that butterfly stoke was used in swimming and who invented it . In 1934 , however , David Armbruster , coach at the University of Iowa , devised a double overarm recovery out of the water . This `` butterfly '' arm action gave more speed but required greater training and conditioning . Then in 1935 , Jack Sieg , a University of Iowa swimmer , developed the skill of swimming on his side and beating his legs in unison like a fish 's tail . He then developed the leg action face down . Armbruster and Sieg combined the butterfly arm action with this leg action and learned to coordinate the two efficiently . With two kicks to each butterfly arm action , Sieg swam 100 yards in 1:00.2 . This kick was named the dolphin fishtail kick.Even though the butterfly breaststroke , as it was called , was faster than the breaststroke , the dolphin fishtail kick was declared a violation of competitive rules . For the next 20 years , champion breaststrokers used an out-of-water arm recovery ( butterfly ) with a shortened breaststroke kick . In 1953 , the butterfly stroke with the dolphin kick was legalized as a separate stroke for competition . Many swimmers say the `` wiggle '' is the key to the stroke and that a swimmer who can undulate through the water naturally can more easily learn the butterfly .",0

"Preparing a Solution ? How many grams of CaCl2 are needed to prepare 147.5 mL of a 1.270 M solution ? Please explain your answer so I can learn : D. Thanks ! 1 mole ( also represented as mol ) = 6.022x10^23 . This is just a number . Molecules are represented in mol quantities because they 're too small to work with otherwise . So that when you are dealing with CaCl2 in these problems , you 're actually using 6.022x10^23 molecules of CaCl2 . Additionally , when you see the molecular weight of a molecule , that is actually the weight of 1mol of that molecule.1M= 1mol/Litre . You need 1.27M . Divide 1.27 by 1,000 to find the number of mol CaCl2 per mL you need . ( 1.27/1,000=0.00127mol CaCl2/mL ) Multiply this by 147.5 to get the number of mol CaCl2 you will have . ( 0.00127*147.5= 0.187325mol CaCl2 ) Now multiply this number by the molecular weight of CaCl2 to get your answer ! ( 0.187325*110.984= 20.79g CaCl2 )",0

When the job was done he returned the broom to the garage , unaware that its brushes were still smoldering . A spark ignited a can of nearby gasoline , which exploded in front of him . His 11-year old brother , Barrett , saved him by rolling him around on the ground , but Frank was left with burns on the right side of his neck , chest and his shoulders . Over the next few years he endured dozens of painful skin grafts and was left with permanent scarring .",0

"What are charter schools ? Charter schoolCharter schools are semi-autonomous nonsectarian public school choice educational alternatives that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional state schools . Generally they are organized by educators , parents , community groups or private organizations with an express purpose or philosophy , and controlled independent of any local school district . Charter schools are generally financed by the same per-pupil funds that traditional state schools receive.In the United States , laws governing charter schools vary from state to state . The legal charter establishing each such school is a performance contract detailing the school 's mission , program , goals , students served , methods of assessment , and ways to measure success . The length of time for which charters are granted varies , but most are granted for 3-5 years . Charter schools are accountable to their sponsor—a local school board , state education agency , university , or other entity—to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract . The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability . They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups , including the sponsor that grants them , the parents who choose them , and the public that funds them . Charter schools can be closed for failing to meet the terms set forth in their charter.OverviewThe term `` charter school '' started in the U.S. , but many of the related ideas such as granting greater autonomy to local schools , independence from local school boards , and operating under a charter , have existed in and out of the U.S. for some time . Charters allow publicly funded schools to act and operate more like private schools , but still have public obligations that private schools do not have . Some charter school advocates believe that competition from charter schools provides choices to families , which will force the other public schools to perform better.The concept of public charter schools was first proposed by the Citizens League , a Minnesota political lobby group . The first charter school opened in Minnesota in 1991 , and as of the 2005-2006 school year , more than 3,600 charter schools are in operation in 40 states and the District of Columbia , enrolling more than 1 million students ( National Charter School Directory , The Center for Education Reform ) . Charter schools reflect their founders ' varied philosophies , programs , and organizational structures , and serve diverse student populations.Charter schools are commonly founded as schools for students that may not be served well by traditional public schools in their communities ( such as pregnant teens or teen parents , drop-outs , and other at-risk populations ) or those with special educational needs . Some provide a `` niche '' education , providing a strong focus on dual languages , technology , or the arts.Critics of charter schools claim they may siphon off the best students and leave regular public schools worse off . Supporters argue charter schools have been more likely to serve disadvantaged student populations . Many charter school administrators and parents argue that charter schools serve those students who are not getting their fair share at public schools . Most charter schools in big cities focus on Title I students.Opinions vary as to the success of charter schools , in part because of the philosophical outlook taken , and in part because—as may be expected—such schools vary one from another in quality , competence , and effectiveness .",0

The Last Farewell ( English version of Mi Ultimo Adios ) by Jose RizalFarewell , my adored Land , region of the sun caressed , Pearl of the Orient Sea , our Eden lost , With gladness I give you my Life , sad and repressed ; And were it more brilliant , more fresh and at its best , I would still give it to you for your welfare at most.On the fields of battle , in the fury of fight , Others give you their lives without pain or hesitancy , The place does not matter : cypress laurel , lily white , Scaffold , open field , conflict or martyrdom 's site , It is the same if asked by home and Country.I die as I see tints on the sky b'gin to showAnd at last announce the day , after a gloomy night ; If you need a hue to dye your matutinal glow , Pour my blood and at the right moment spread it so , And gild it with a reflection of your nascent light ! My dreams , when scarcely a lad adolescent , My dreams when already a youth , full of vigor to attain , Were to see you , gem of the sea of the Orient , Your dark eyes dry , smooth brow held to a high planeWithout frown , without wrinkles and of shame without stain.My life 's fancy , my ardent , passionate desire , Hail ! Cries out the soul to you , that will soon part from thee ; Hail ! How sweet 't is to fall that fullness you may acquire ; To die to give you life , 'neath your skies to expire , And in your mystic land to sleep through eternity ! If over my tomb some day , you would see blow , A simple humble flow'r amidst thick grasses , Bring it up to your lips and kiss my soul so , And under the cold tomb , I may feel on my brow , Warmth of your breath , a whiff of your tenderness.Let the moon with soft , gentle light me descry , Let the dawn send forth its fleeting , brilliant light , In murmurs grave allow the wind to sigh , And should a bird descend on my cross and alight , Let the bird intone a song of peace o'er my site.Let the burning sun the raindrops vaporizeAnd with my clamor behind return pure to the sky ; Let a friend shed tears over my early demise ; And on quiet afternoons when one prays for me on high , Pray too , oh , my Motherland , that in God may rest I.Pray thee for all the hapless who have died , For all those who unequalled torments have undergone ; For our poor mothers who in bitterness have cried ; For orphans , widows and captives to tortures were shied , And pray too that you may see your own redemption.And when the dark night wraps the cemet'ryAnd only the dead to vigil there are left alone , Do n't disturb their repose , do n't disturb the mystery : If you hear the sounds of cittern or psaltery , It is I , dear Country , who , a song t'you intone.And when my grave by all is no more remembered , With neither cross nor stone to mark its place , Let it be plowed by man , with spade let it be scatteredAnd my ashes ere to nothingness are restored , Let them turn to dust to cover your earthly space.Then it does n't matter that you should forget me : Your atmosphere , your skies , your vales I 'll sweep ; Vibrant and clear note to your ears I shall be : Aroma , light , hues , murmur , song , moanings deep , Constantly repeating the essence of the faith I keep.My idolized Country , for whom I most gravely pine , Dear Philippines , to my last goodbye , oh , harkenThere I leave all : my parents , loves of mine , I 'll go where there are no slaves , tyrants or hangmenWhere faith does not kill and where God alone does reign.Farewell , parents , brothers , beloved by me , Friends of my childhood , in the home distressed ; Give thanks that now I rest from the wearisome day ; Farewell , sweet stranger , my friend , who brightened my way ; Farewell , to all I love . To die is to rest .",0

"i want information on VLSI systems or paper on it. ? i want to present paper on VLSI systems . Very-large-scale integration ( VLSI ) of systems of transistor-based circuits into integrated circuits on a single chip first occurred in the 1980s as part of the semiconductor and communication technologies that were being developed.The first semiconductor chips held one transistor each . Subsequent advances added more and more transistors , and as a consequence more individual functions or systems were integrated over time . The microprocessor is a VLSI device.The first `` generation '' of computers relied on vacuum tubes . Then came discrete semiconductor devices , followed by integrated circuits . The first Small-Scale Integration ( SSI ) ICs had small numbers of devices on a single chip – diodes , transistors , resistors and capacitors ( no inductors though ) , making it possible to fabricate one or more logic gates on a single device . The fourth generation consisted of Large-Scale Integration ( LSI ) , i.e . systems with at least a thousand logic gates . The natural successor to LSI was VLSI ( many tens of thousands of gates on a single chip ) . Current technology has moved far past this mark and today 's microprocessors have many millions of gates and hundreds of millions of individual transistors.As of mid-2004 , billion-transistor processors are not yet economically feasible for most uses , but they are achievable in laboratory settings , and they are clearly on the horizon as semiconductor fabrication moves from the current generation of 90 nanometer ( 90nm ) processes to the next 65nm and 45nm generations.At one time , there was an effort to name and calibrate various levels of large-scale integration above VLSI . Terms like Ultra-large-scale Integration ( ULSI ) were used . But the huge number of gates and transistors available on common devices has rendered such fine distinctions moot . Terms suggesting more-than-VLSI levels of integration are no longer in widespread use . Even VLSI is now somewhat quaint , given the common assumption that all microprocessors are VLSI or better .",0

"Fibromyalgia ? Help ? ? ? ? 15 yr old with severe fibromyalgia ... any tips ? Find answers to these issues and you will live with less pain More effective , guilt-free communications with family and friends about symptoms Avoiding frustrations at the doctor 's office , which may range from discussing symptoms to requesting specific therapies Handling demands on limited time Keeping up with job duties or household tasks without causing a flare-up Striving for and maintaining a better quality of life—one that makes you both happier and healthier How to respond to hurtful comments from others TreatmentIn general , treatment for fibromyalgia is with a combination of medication and self-care . The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health.MedicationsMedications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep . The ones most commonly recommended by doctors include : Analgesics . Over-the-counter acetaminophen ( Tylenol , others ) may ease the pain and stiffness caused by fibromyalgia . However , its effectiveness varies with individuals . Tramadol ( Ultram ) is a prescription pain reliever that may be taken with or without acetaminophen . Your doctor may have you take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) — such as aspirin , ibuprofen ( Advil , Motrin , others ) or naproxen sodium ( Anaprox , Aleve ) — in conjunction with other medications , but NSAIDs have n't proven to be effective in managing the pain in fibromyalgia when taken by themselves . Antidepressants . Your doctor may prescribe antidepressant medications , such as amitriptyline , nortriptyline ( Aventyl , Pamelor ) or doxepin ( Sinequan ) to help promote sleep . Fluoxetine ( Prozac ) in combination with amitriptyline has also been found effective . Sertraline ( Zoloft ) and paroxetine ( Paxil ) also are effective if you 're suffering from depression . These medications may be beneficial by affecting serotonin levels in the brain . Muscle relaxants . Taking the medication cyclobenzaprine ( Flexeril ) at bedtime may help treat muscle pain and spasms . Benzodiazepines . These drugs may help relax muscles and promote sleep . Usually , doctors avoid benzodiazepines in treating fibromyalgia because they have n't been shown to have long-term benefit and have the potential for drug dependence . Prescription sleeping pills , such as zolpidem ( Ambien ) , may provide short-term benefits for some people with fibromyalgia , but doctors usually advise against long-term use of these drugs . These medications tend to work for only a short time , after which your body becomes resistant to their effects . Ultimately , using sleeping pills tends to create even more sleeping problems in many people.Doctors do n't usually recommend narcotics for treating fibromyalgia because of the potential for dependence and addiction . Corticosteroids , such as prednisone , have n't been shown to be effective in treating fibromyalgia.Cognitive-behavioral therapyCognitive-behavioral therapy seeks to increase your belief in your own abilities and teaches you methods for dealing with stressful situations . Therapy can be provided via individual counseling , audiotapes or classes , and may help you manage your fibromyalgia.Treatment programsInterdisciplinary treatment programs may be effective in improving your symptoms , including relieving pain . These programs can combine a variety of treatments , such as relaxation techniques , biofeedback and receiving information about chronic pain . There is n't one combination that works best for everybody . Your doctor can create a program based on what works best for you . Self-careSelf-care is critical in the management of fibromyalgia . Important aspects of self-care include taking these actions : Reduce stress . Develop a plan to avoid or limit overexertion and emotional stress . Allow yourself time each day to relax . That may mean learning how to say no without guilt . But do n't change your routine totally . People who quit work or drop all activity tend to do worse than those who",0

Historically , when coming to a camp , we would greet the sentry with `` shalom aleichem ! '' or `` peace be among you '' , ( almost a question and statement at the same time ) and the appropriate response from the sentry would be `` aleichem shalom '' or `` among us , there is peace '' This lets the vistors know that everything is fine at the camp , and that they are welcome to enter the camp . This is how it was done back then , and that form of answering with the subjects reversed remains to be the appropriate greetingUpdate : Toda , toda . Beruch ti hiyeh ! Update : Technically SFederow . In the example I used the senrty is speaking for the camp in its singular entirety .

I 'll be using the notebook for internet and typing papers . Thanks guys ! ! ! I work on an HP Compaq NC6000 that work supplied me and I like it . I 've had it over a year . It 's been reliable and fast . My wife has owned a Toshiba for over three years.I surf the internet , play music on it , write technical papers , send e-mails , write programs , and run numerical analyses on it.Battery life could be better . I can only go for about an hour and a half before the battery depletes.If you are going to be taking notes in classes , you may want to get two batteries for it so you can get several hours of uptime without connecting to a power supply.The rest of it ... Gigahertz , Pentium , Celeron , AMD really does n't matter these days . Almost any laptop will play DVDs ( with a DVD player ) , CDs , etc plenty fast.In fact , the lower the Gigahertz ( the clock rate which at which the processor ( AMD or Intel ) ticks along ) , the longer your batter life may be . Slowest Gigahertz you should go with is about 1.5GHz.I would make sure that the notebook has at least 512MB of memory , preferably 1GB . This is important if you run several programs at once ( e-mail , internet , music player , and word processor ) . If you do n't , things can slow down and wear down battery life faster as data is moved on and off disk.I would go with a 15 '' LCD . 17 '' is better if you are at your desk all the time , but if you are carrying the thing around a lot , the smaller display makes for a more compact laptop .

"Is Jesus Christ born on Christmas Day ? No one knows for sure when Jesus Christ was born , but many scholars believe it was probably around the first of October .

Higher density ( heavier ) snow typically results from warmer temperatures and/or winds while lower density ( lighter snow ) usually results from colder air with less wind .",0

Plasmas created in the lab do n't form into a stable sphere though . Maybe ball lightning holds itself together by controlling its own magnetic field . It could get its energy from nuclear fusion . The exact nature of the ball lightning is still unknown . Some UFO enthusiasts , however , believe them to be some kind of intelligence or come from some kind of intelligence .",0

"Would Bush eventually be impeached ? ? His spying has taken a vicious turn.Who knows what cat might come out of the bag in the coming days ? ? Unfortunately , since both houses of the legislature are controlled by Republicans , the liklihood of President Bush being impeached is virtually nil.In order for him to be impeached , the House of Representatives would need to file articles of impeachment , which are passed by a simple majority . In order for this to occur , some Republican representatives would have to cross the aisle and vote with the Democratic minority . In the remote chance that this would happen , the case would be forwarded to the Senate for trial.Once in the Senate , two thirds of the present Senators would be required . Once again , since the Republicans control this part of the House , the liklihood of an actual impeachment occuring is remote at best.And on another note , punishment is determined by the Senate . They can choose to remove him from office , or do nothing should he be impeached . Again , the odds of anything happening are slim and none.While it 's nice to dream , we 're going to have to wait for President Bush to leave office in eary 2009 , unless the political landscape shifts drastically between now and then.Read the Wiki below for more info .",0

"HOw do El Ninos warm water 's affect the weather. ? needs to be at least 80 words long okay , now that enough time has gone by to keep you from just copying this onto your homework : ( at least that 's what I read in when you say ..needs to be 80 words.. ) I quote : '' Because El Niño 's warm pool feeds thunderstorms above , it creates increased rainfall across the east-central and eastern Pacific Ocean.In South America , the effects of El Niño are direct and stronger than in North America . An El Niño is associated with warm and very wet summers ( December-February ) along the coasts of northern Peru and Ecuador , causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme . The effects during the months of February , March and April may become critical . Southern Brazil and northern Argentina also experience wetter than normal conditions but mainly during the spring and early summer . Central Chile receives a mild winter with large rainfall , and the Peruvian-Bolivian Altiplano is sometimes exposed to unusual winter snowfall events . Drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the Amazon River Basin , Colombia and Central America.Direct effects of El Niño resulting in drier conditions occur in Indonesia , increasing forest fires , in the Philippines , and northern Australia . Drier than normal conditions are also generally observed in Queensland , inland Victoria , inland New South Wales and eastern Tasmania during June-August.West of the Antarctic Peninsula , the Ross , Bellingshausen , and Amundsen Sea sectors have more sea ice during El Niño . The latter two and the Weddell Sea also become warmer and have higher atmospheric pressure.In North America , typically , winters are warmer than normal in the upper Midwest states and Canada , while central and southern California , northwest Mexico and the southeastern U.S. , are wetter than normal . Summer is wetter in the intermountain regions of the U.S . The Pacific Northwest states , on the other hand , tend to be drier during an El Niño . During a La Niña , by contrast , the Midwestern U.S. tends to be drier than normal . El Niño is also associated with decreased hurricane activity in the Atlantic.Finally , East Africa , including Kenya , Tanzania and the White Nile basin , experiences in the long rains from March to May wetter than normal conditions . There also are drier than normal conditions from December to February in south-central Africa , mainly in Zambia , Zimbabwe , Mozambique and Botswana '' source : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_nino",0

"What should I expect if I become a single parent. ? Explain the hardships and the joys of single parenting . What should I expect out of my future former spouse ? He is of the bullying , mentally abusive breed to both the kids and I . It really depends on whether you have a helpful , concerned family around and some close friendships . It 's also a consideration if you have work skills or not .

The numbers are not `` very nice '' , so the angle is n't as well.When you got the angle t , your answer will be , rcost + irsin t , where r is the radius sqrt ( 13 ) and the angle is the `` ugly t '' you found by applying arctan to -1.52 ) Present it in the trig form as well , as 2sqrt ( 2 ) [ cos3PI/4+isin3PI/4 ] .Apply De Moivre formula to elevate to the 8 power : R ( cost+isint ) ^n= R^n ( cos nt+isin nt ) 4096 ( cos 6PI + isin 6PI ) = 4096 ( 1+0 ) = 4096Alternatively , elevate first to the second power .

"are chiropractors legitimate doctors ? I do n't understand what they do . How is what they do considered practicing medicine ? Chiropractors are doctors in a sense that they have earned a DC ( Doctor of Chiropractic ) . But they are prohibited by law to prescribe medicines other then natural herbs and things like that . They DO NOT have to take the MCAT , they DO NOT have to go through residencies . There are 2 types of fully licensed doctors in the U.S. which are MD ( Doctor of Allopathic medicine ) and DO ( Docotor of Osteopathic Medicine ) . A Chiropractor is limited in what they can and can not do . For example , they are prohibited to practice in a hospital , they can not perform surgery or treat mental disorders . But the choice of whether a DC is a legitimate doctor will be up to the patient , someone with a PhD . can call themselves a docotor also.In closing , my opinion DO , MD or DC , they all must work together to achieve the one central goal which is to help imporve one 's quality of life . Only then will the patient have the best chance to be free of sickness . But I prefer to go to a MD or DO .",0

"How do you bind a vampire or a werewolf ? Aside from holy water , garlic , etc. , what do the myths say ? If werewolves can be killed with a silver bullet , with what material do you capture them alive ? Do plain metal chains work ? Or do they have to be made of certain materials ? The Slavs ( from around the year 300 ) believed that vampires were afraid of silver ( but could n't be killed with it ) and that one could kill them by cutting their head off and placing it between their legs , or by stabbing them with a wooden stake in the heart . During the Middle Ages , the myth transformed a bit . People used holy water , wooden stake , and cross to kill a vampire ( we can see the influence of the Christianity here ) . If people suspected that a dead person has turned into a vampire , they would dig them out and stick a stake into the heart . This was n't meant to kill the vampire but to bind it to the grave . Serbs believed that every single drop of blood had to be destroyed or else the vampire would still be `` alive '' ( they were more or less living corpses , but you get my point ) so they used to burn the vampire after that . Then butterflies would fly out of the vampire and people had to kill each one of them . Garlic can only scare the vampire because of its strong and unpleasant smell . In order to stop the vampire 's visits at night , people would hang garlic near every hole in the house ( for example keyhole , chimney , windows ... , because people believed that the vampire could enter the house even through the smallest hole ) . One could also throw some seeds before the vampire , since they had to stop and count them all . I 'm not really sure how they used to capture them . I know vampires could be captured by stealing that cloth they had over them in the grave , but I have seen this only in vampire stories . But in reality , people were just killing them and they were probably too scared to just capture them ( that 'd be pointless , would n't it ) . Although in Asia there were some kinds of vampires which people used to capture and then keep them in wooden cages and feed them eggs : P I have n't heard of any captured werewolves either . If you want to investigate a bit , try reading some legends and old beliefs from the Balkans ; I promise you 'll find it very interesting !",0

"How to protect yourself from the pain of love ? I avoided him for weeks because I just did n't feel an instant attraction or any chemistry . He was persistent and somehow broke through the brick wall . I fell for him and fell hard . He was everything I 'd asked God for - a Christian , strong , handsome , loving , caring and put me on a pedestal . I treated him like a prince , respected him , but held him accountable in the areas where he struggled ( something he said he wanted ) . Just when life could n't get any better , he decided that God was telling him to go back to his ex who treats him like crud . The joy was indescribable , but so is the pain ... and honestly , even moreso . I do n't think the chance of true love is worth the pain of rejection . How does one protect themselves from pain of this sort without isolating everyone and turning into the lonliest person in the world ? The pain of rejection is temporary . You feel it now because the wound is fresh . But wounds always get better with time . However bad it has been losing this guy for you , you will surely get over it . Because , pain is always temporary.Whereas , the joy of true love , when you do find it , is permanent . It is an eternal paradise . You have already had a glimpse of it . Just imagine how wonderful it would be if such a joy lasted forever . So dont think the pain is not worth bearing . It is . Not just once or twice but as many times it takes . Never lose faith in true love . Just because one person struck hollow , doesnt mean every other guy will . The only way to be happy is to believe that there is good and happiness and it is attainable.There is no way you can protect yourself from this sort of pain . It is a part of life . But so is the happiness . Someday it will be yours . All you have to do is hang in there , especially during the delicates moments like the ones you 're going through now . Dont lose hope.. the world is a beautiful garden with many wonderful flowers.You 'll find your rose . Time is all it takes .",0

"Is an american high school dipolma accepted/recognized in Germany , as being equal to the German school system ? I was told ( here in Germany ) that my High School Diploma is not offical regonized in Germany and that I may have to go back to school to finish the German 'Schulabschlus ' . Is that true ? Has anyone gone through this before ? ? ? It depends on what you need it for . For admittance to the University System in Germany , this is true . Not even some years at a US college are enough . You have to go through the certification process of the particular region for this . It is true , that the US diploma from high school is not the same because Germany has several systems for public education . I have never heard of people having to go 'back to school ' but I have heard of people having to take qualifying examinations for University admissions.See : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_school_system",0

If you have done well in high school the easier it is to get funding . You can also get scholarships from all over the place .

"If a person has a child in the US , and they themselves are n't citizens , are they entitled to any benefits ? Can they receive Section 8 or welfare benefits for themselves and their child ? Would they be forced to return to their country with the child ? Is citizen status of child enough to gain any benefits ? They are entitled to a limited number of benefits because the US will not take away the child from you ( do n't worry about that unless you prove that you are terrible parents ) Anyway returning to the question - Since the child was born in the US is thus a US citizen . You can confirm that because the child will be issued a Birth Certificate by the state and a Social Security Number by the SS Office . Based on your income your child and for a certain period of time the mother can qualify for medical aid by the govt . You need to get in touch with the hospital 's social workers or the local Social Services Department office . Do that ASAP as the child will need doctor 's visits and routine shots . There are also programs such as Food Stamps and such that will help in the financial for taking care of the child . In case the parents visas expire and have to return back to their country , they can take the baby with them . Just ensure that you have with you the ss , birth certificate , ( I am not sure about the US passport though ) . But rest assured worrying about the citizenship should not be the biggest concern as much as the care of both the `` little baby '' and the mother . Good luck .

"How is `` Evolution '' plausible or logical ? Simply because Darwin used well developed ( by humans , but well developed nonetheless ) , well proven , scientific methodolgy instead of relying on the dogmas of a belief system to base his observations on.Keep in mind that , in science , there are very few laws any longer . Everything is a theory because , especially after relativity , scientists discovered that our universe does n't stay consistent as you move into and out of certain states ( like the speed of light ) . However , this does not eliminate the theory as quackery or false . It means that the theory can only be applied in certain circumstances ( it 's relative to certain states ) so it can not be a `` law '' as laws are immutable.That being said , science only has observable evidence as it 's foundation ( or provable evidence through mathematics ) . Darwin observed the various species on the Galapagos islands and drew conclusions as to the nature of their adaptations ( long beaks , short beaks , etc. ) . He also observed that various birds with nearly identical characteristics had slight variations in their adaptations . This caused him to draw other conclusions . In short , he used a scientific process to develop early versions of his theory of evolution . It has been scrutinized since , and the only ones `` disproving '' it have been those who belive religious texts are God 's absolute word.I am a believer in Christ , yet I see no issue with believing there is truth to Darwin 's theories . Did God ultimately create all things ? Of course He did . However , is the Bible absolute in it 's description in the origins of life ? Probably not . Even Christ , according to the biblical record , spoke in stories ( parables ) most of the time so people would understand his message and have examples to work from . He rarely spoke in absolutes , and when he did it was usually only with the apostles.I belive that Genesis is a parable describing God 's creation of all that is , in an understandable way since it is unlikely that we will ever completely understand how He did it . However , even I admit it is only a belief , and may be wrong , like Darwin may be wrong , or literal interpretations of Genesis may be wrong .",0

But I do n't think so its enough..I am looking for something exotic..no birds..and something which is 'legal ' in the US . I always wanted a leopard ! ! I 'm particularly fond of reptiles . Snakes in particular , I like the large breeds . However , it is an awesome responsibility to take on many types of exotic pets . They require considerable financial and time investiments on your part . Just being `` crazy about animals '' is NO where near enough . You MUST be willing to take on the very special needs of the pet . My Red Tailed Boa , for example , is considered a `` giant snake '' . She will likely reach 10 foot long ( she is already 8 1/2 or so ) and eats two `` collossal sized '' rats every 10 days or so . Her cage is 2'X 2'X 8 ' on a 3 ' tall cabinet . Its roughly 300 gallons and is simply adequate for her size at this point . Her humidity and heat have to be maintained very precisely . The cage and all the environmental parts and necessities to maintain her in a healthy tropical space is about a $ 3000 investment ( she only cost $ 80 ) . If you have the means and the interest in such an animal , I do have some excellent designs for a humidification system that will manage a vented cage of this size.Here is a link to some specialty cages.http : //www.cagesbydesign.com/and here is the humidification system and some pictures of Pandora at home : http : //www.osagecollies.com/humid",0

"Do men and women see things differently ? The short answer is 'yes ' unless you are referring to sight.The right and left hemispheres of the human brain are connected by a huge nerve bundle called the corpus callosum . In the male fetus when male hormones are generated the corpus callosum shrinks reducing cross-communication . Because the left hemisphere deals with logic and the right hemisphere deals with emotion , women connect all logic better with emotion than men do . Although a man can chose , he is always either logical or emotional but rarely both at the same time . A man either flies off the handle or thinks the problem through . A woman can weep or laugh when she discovers something that makes sense . This explains why women are better at nurturing ( cranky ) children and men are better at hunting for bears ( or a six pack ) . Of course men can care for their children and women can hunt bare ; I mean bear .",0
"what does center do really ? i 'm new to this sport but i like it very much.can anybody teach me a little Typically , the center is the tallest man on the floor . Traditional centers stay close to the basket on offense , where they can use their size to get good shots because they are so close . Often these are dunks , layups , put backs ( shots off of a rebound ) , or hook shots . They 're also expected to be the best rebounders , since they are taller than everyone else.On defense , centers again stay close to the basket because if a guard or forward gets around the person defending them , the center can still slide over and block or alter the shot ( since presumably , he is taller than the player trying to shoot ) . They are again expected to rebound.Non-traditional centers , particularly those from foreign countries ( no idea why ) , move farther from the basket to shoot . Some , like China 's Wang Zhu-Zhu , are actually good three point shooters . Having a center like this is sometimes considered an advantage , since traditional centers are not used to guarding a player far from the basket .",0
"Where can I find a cheap LCD Monitor ? There are a ton of specs for monitors , which ones are important and which ones just make it cost more ? I 'd like to scrap my big monitor if I can find a good one . The main thing with LCD monitors is response time . If you play games a low response time causes ghosting effects which makes the image appear blurred , one with a fast response time ( 16ms or better ) will not have this problem . You are in luck , the prices of LCD monitors have plummeted in the past few years and you can get a very good one from either Viewsonic or Samsung for around $ 200 for a 17 '' LCD monitor which has a resolution of 1280 x 1024 and 15 '' monitors have a resolution of 1024 x 768 . I would get a 17 '' . There are n't many other factors to consider besides maybe contrast ratio which is measured in ratios like 450:1 but tests have shown each manufacturer uses their own scale and some 450:1 monitors made by Samsung and Viewsonic are actually brighter and sharper than 600:1 monitors made by off-brand companies.At any rate , you ca n't go wrong with Viewsonic or Samsung and you just ca n't beat Newegg for selection or service.17 '' Viewsonics here , http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp ?

If you are hoping for non-attributable material in essay form , you wo n't get it here.Answers ... The Holocaust , meaning the Nazi German program to eradicate `` undesirable races '' like Jews , Gypsies and Slavs , happened primarily in what is now known as Poland and Germany , although one could argue that the round ups and other terror spread throughout most of occupied Europe.The rough period of the Holcaust varies depending on opinions . I rather believe it started with Kristalnacht on November 10 , 1938 and did n't end until 1945 with the final liberation . Survivors and their familes might tell you that they still suffer , therefore it has n't ended.Why is more complicated . I would read `` Hitler 's Willing Executioners '' by Daniel Goldhagen for a fairly succinct answer . However , it was the result of Nazi Germany 's effort to `` purify '' the `` Aryan '' ( what toff , as though they were Aryan ) race by killing off the so-called `` sub-humans '' .",0

"Dose the moon orbit the sun ? If we just look at the sun , earth , moon system , all three bodies orbit the center of mass of this 3-body system . Since the sun is much more massive than the other two bodies , the location of the center of mass of this system is inside the sun , so the sun moves very little , while the earth and moon appear to orbit the sun.Now , the earth and the moon also interact gravitationally , and they orbit the center of mass of the earth moon system The center of mass of this earth-moon system is located inside the earth , so the moon looks like it orbits the earth . You can view the earth and moon as being in orbit around their center of mass , and the earth-moon system center of mass being in orbit around the earth-sun-moon system.If the sun , earth , moon had equivalent masses , and if there were no other gravity bodies in the universe , they would appear to have orbits around the center of mass of this smaller earth , moon , sun system.I think the term '' orbit '' can be a little confusing because it 's not always clearly defined . The gravitational attraction of the sun on the moon is greater than the earth 's attraction on the moon , so you could also argue that the moon really orbits the sun , with it 's orbit modified by the earth .",0

We have hope for a better world , believing that this is our one chance , and as such , our responsibility to future generations.You assumptions are much the same as a billionaire believing that a migrant farm worker can not be happy because he has no money . Or a farm worker believing that a wealthy man can not be happy because he is tethered to his work.It is very presumptuous to assume that just because someone has something ( or lacks something ) that they can not be happy.Anyone care to comment on this ? Whew -- Here 's a question to all those who post about religious folks and non-religious folks ... Are we ever going to settle this ? Yeah did n't think so.Still I commend Wrathpuppet and the more thoughtful responders by espousing their beliefs in as clear a manner as possible , and Schneb- That 's got to be one of your shorter replies , kudos on the mutual respect.I 'm going to shy away from a grandiose analogy , for a simpler one that might still fit.Ever went to see a movie the day it came out , was blown away by it , and when you told your friends they needed to see it , and right away , they blew you off ? Ya know like they 'd heard bad reviews , or just did n't think the material was something they were interested in . But it 's killing you because you love and respect these people and you wish them to share in this wonderful cinematic experience ... and you 're sure if they would just take the time and go , they 'd thank you for it later ? ** to carry this theme out ... it 's not that you believe these folks ( that you 're trying to tell about this great movie ) have never seen a good picture before or that they could n't discover it on their own , it 's just that it was SO good for you , SO moving , SO vital , that you really believed if they never saw it , their life would not be as rich as if they had.Shortest answer possible , they think they 're doing you a favor or a kindness , you may already have an interesting life that has happiness in it , but they fear for your eternal happiness . I for one will leave each to their own , and only try an help the ones who say they are unhappy or in some need , and the answer from me rarely will have religious overtones . My God is just love . Wrath , judgement , the need to be worshipped and obeyed are the attributes of other 's Gods . The afterlife does not hold auditions .",0

"Will an AGP8x graphics card work on a AGP4x slot ? I 'm interested in buying a graphics card for my PC . This card ( GeForce 6500A ) is labeled `` AGP 8x '' , but the AGP slot on my motherboard is 1x , 2x and 4x compatible.Is there a backward compatibility between 8x and 4x ? I just found this website ( http : //www.ertyu.org/~steven_nikkel/agpcompatibility.html ) giving explanations on voltage , but no real answer.Thanks . Sorry to say it wo n't . There are some cards that say 8x/4x compatibility , it will work in both , but if the card is only labeled as 8x , it will probably cause problems in a 4x slots , if it will work at all.The opposite can usually be done . If you have an 8x slot , a 4x will most often work just fine . However , if you have an 8x card , it requires a minimum of an 8x slot.The backwards compatibility in this case is higher slot to lower card , not the reverse .",0

"What is the difference between a desktop and a workstation ? I am thinking about alienware , any suggestions. ? I need lots of computing power w/ the option of using for media/games . Systems about $ 1500 . There may have been a distinction between a desktop and a workstation in the past but there 's only a faint gray line that differentiates the two today . A workstation can do anything a consumer desktop can and vice versa . So essentially , they mean the same thing.If you ask Dell or Alienware , however , they 'll probably say workstations are for business and desktops are for consumers . For computer manufacturers , a workstation usually means some of the latest technology . They tend to have SATAII , beefier minimum RAM than deskops , and stronger processors for their `` base systems '' . Of course , you could always configure a base consumer desktop with all of that , so the distinction is moot.If you look carefully , though , there may be one or two small differences . Workstations may prefer to use more expensive ECC RAM . Their video cards may be ISV-certified and use `` workstation-level '' video graphic cores ( nVidia Quadro instead of GeForces , ATI FireGL instead of Radeons ) . And almost always , their starting configurations tend to use a CDROM ( cause , you know , why would you need a DVD burner for work ? ! ) .Again , all of this can be changed . You can buy a workstation with a DVD burner , you can stick in a GeForce 7800GTX , and most likely you can use non-ECC RAM ( check motherboard requirements first though ) .So if you 're an avid gamer and need a good media machine , something from Alienware should do just fine . Personally I would choose a no-frills basic model like Dell 's XPS400 or E510 , get memory from Crucial.com ( or a good local store ) , and buy the video card from NewEgg.com . I 'm not familiar with molecular modeling programs but I would ask around if they are multi-processor enabled applications ( which means can more than one processor be recognized by the program ) . If so , you may want to get a dual-core processor as the modeling program can take advantage of the extra core and help with the number crunching . If not , then choosing a regular single-core CPU would suit you fine and save some cash ( it would be money wasted as games do n't effectively use a second core ) . For RAM , ask around about your modeling program because it would be primarily your task . For games , you 'll want at least 1GB of RAM . For video cards , I would chose whatever your budget allows you . The Nvidia 6600/6800/7800 lines are really good right now and I would n't suggest any ATIs at the moment except for the top-of-the-line X850/X1800 .",0

"What should I eat or not eat to help prevent a herpes outbreak ? Lysine is one of numerous amino acids that the body needs for growth and tissue repair . It is classified as one of the nine `` essential '' amino acids because you need to get it from outside sources such as foods or supplements -- in other words the body ca n't make it on its own . Researchers are exploring the value of lysine supplementation and the consumption of lysine-rich foods for lowering cholesterol , improving athletic performance , and enhancing recovery after surgery.Some nutritionally oriented physicians and dentists recommend taking lysine during an outbreak of canker sores to speed healing . The exact cause of these tiny but quite painful mouth ulcers is unclear , but most research indicates that a virus is responsible . However , there have been almost no clinical trials using lysine as a remedy for canker sores.The most promising application of lysine is its use in managing and preventing painful and unsightly herpes sores caused by the herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) .Specifically , lysine may help to : # Prevent and relieve cold sores ( herpes ) . Exciting research over the past several decades suggests that lysine may be helpful in controlling herpes simplex-related infections . There are two types of this virus : type 1 , which typically causes cold sores or fever blisters around the mouth , and type 2 , which tends to cause genital sores . However , both forms can cause eruptions around the mouth or on the genitals . Once infected with the virus , you have it permanently . It may lie dormant , but it does n't go away . Outbreaks are usually painful and unsightly , as well as contagious.A few years ago , researchers discovered that in order to grow ( replicate ) , the herpes virus needs arginine , another common amino acid . ( Foods high in arginine include chocolate , peanuts , almonds , seeds , cereal grains , gelatin , and raisins . ) Lysine competes with arginine for absorption and entry into tissue cells . And when lysine is present , it inhibits the growth of HSV by knocking out arginine.This makes a diet high in lysine and low in arginine a useful tool in managing HSV infections . In a recent study , participants consumed large amounts of lysine ( about 1 gram three times each day ) while restricting food sources of arginine . A significant number of participants ( 74 % ) noticed an improvement in their HSV infections and a decrease in the number of outbreaks.-As a side note , broccoli is also one of the better vegetable to help your body in keeping outbreaks at bay .",0

"What does sexual side effect mean ? Personal Side Effectsof StatinsImpotence , Loss of Libido and Erectile Dysfunction The pharmaceutical industry would lead us to believe that rapidly bottoming out our natural cholesterol levels through the use of their highly touted statin drugs is a relatively innocuous process of definite benefit to society . But as we learn more each day of this ubiquitous and unique cholesterol substance , we must question the veracity of their medical advisors . Cholesterol is perhaps the most important substance in our lives for we could not live without an abundant supply of it in our bodies . Researchers everywhere are learning how extraordinarily complex and often surprising are the pathways that produce and metabolize cholesterol . Cholesterol is the precursor for a whole class of hormones known as the steroid hormones that are absolutely critical for life , as we know it . These hormones determine our sexuality , control the reproductive process , and regulate blood sugar levels and mineral metabolism . This same substance that society has been taught to fear happens to be our sole source for our hormones , androgen , estrogen and progesterone .",0

"What is the different between Website and Weblog ? A weblog is an online personal journal that is regularly updated on a sometimes daily basis , with a timestamp ( date of posting ) and a byline ( credit of who authored it ) . In other words , it 's nothing more than a cyber version of a diary , in which the author will post thoughts , ideas , feelings , and stories whenever the mood strikes . As opposed to a regular web site , a post can literally be published in *real time* . As a result , blogs tend to be more spontaneous and freeform than regular web sites , since the authors can publish their thoughts instantaneously . They also tend to be more personal , since blogs are usually places in which authors talk about events in their personal lives , observations , or whatever feelings they may be having at the moment.But not all blogs are personal . Some have just been places for people to post news items that they are interested in , or a gathering place for more than one person to merely post their views about current political , social , cultural or other interesting news events of the day .",0

"Does the government have the right to order private internet companies to provide user 's search records ? Lately both Yahoo and Google where served a court ordered to hand over to the government some search records regarding porn Some good answers here . I 'll take a stab at it myself , though I do n't know anything about the incidents other than what the original poster included in his question.First , we 're talking about illegal pornography . `` Regular '' porn , the kind that is n't illegal depending on whoever 's standards we 're using , is n't going to be subject to a search warrant because it is n't a crime ... and search warrants can only be issued when they seek to provide evidence of a public offense ( a crime ) . So whatever porn we 're talking about , it 's evidently illegal according to whatever legal standard is being used ( and this varies , but things like kiddy porn are illegal everywhere in the US ) . Once the illegality has been established , then I do n't think there 's much left to talk about ... you can not hide behind a right to privacy if you are engaging in criminal behavior . That 's not to say you give up your right to privacy , it 's to say that if you 're engaging in criminal acts , the government has the right to ask a judge for a search warrant to gather evidence of those acts , and I would argue that you can not complain about your privacy being `` invaded '' when they do.And a word about search warrants ; they are not rubber-stamped documents that sail through the justice system to your front door . Law enforcement agents must prepare an application for them , outlining reasons to believe a particular place holds evidence of a particular crime . They must swear the things they 've said in that document are true , and then they must present the document to a neutral party - a magistrate ( or a judge ) . That magistrate ( or judge ) then reviews the information provided by the agent , and decides on his/her own if there is a more than likely chance ( i.e. , `` probable cause '' ) that the things the agents are looking for are in the places the agents say they are . Despite the rare news to the contrary , magistrates and law enforcement alike take this process seriously.About the `` third party '' argument made by the original poster : again - if you 're engaging in criminal behavior , you can not expect to hide behind the right to privacy just because you 've given the evidence of your guilt to a third party . The government has the right under our system of law to gather evidence of your criminal behavior , no matter where you have left it.If you want to deliver evidence of your involvement in criminal acts to a third party , press on ... and you do so at your own risk , obviously . The original poster 's comment is well taken ; if your third party is going to comply with an order of a court to disclose certain information relative to criminal acts , then perhaps you need to find another third party - one who will become a criminal themselves if they fail to comply with a lawful court order.Yahoo and Google have not betrayed anyone 's trust ... although it 's been a while since I 've seen them , I 'm fairly certain both corporations have privacy policies , and I 'm equally certain both of them talk about safeguarding your information except when ordered to release it pursuant to a court order . If the third party thing bothers you , do n't use a third party ... there 's a saying : `` three can keep a secret , if two are dead . '' Do n't want anybody to know what you 're doing ? Do n't tell anybody .",0

"How do I install memory into my computer ? My computer savvy friend left me hanging w/ RAM she ordered for me via Ebay and no instructions.Have Gateway system bought secondhand . PLEASE , help me ! Installing Memory:1 . Open the case . You can leave all of the plugs in place and components attached.2 . Get grounded . Before touching the new memory or anything inside the computer , you need to get grounded . The easiest way to be sure that you are grounded is to use an inexpensive antistatic wrist strap that can be purchased at a local electronics or computer store . If you don ’ t have a wrist strap , touch the inside of the chassis while the PC is still plugged in ; this will ground you . Once you are grounded , unplug the computer from the wall.3 . Find the place to insert the module . Look for other memory like the memory you have just purchased . You will see empty slots next to the memory that is already in place.4 . Pick up the memory module by the side edges . Don ’ t touch the flat surfaces or the contacts along the bottom . Orient the memory to match the memory that is already installed . Insert the memory module in the first empty slot next to the currently installed memory . Different types of memory install slightly differently.a . DIMMs and most newer types of memory are simply inserted into the slot with a gentle downward pressure . The clips on both sides of the module must snap into place for the module to be properly seated.b . SIMMs are a slightly older type of memory found in most computers more than three years old . They are inserted at a 45-degree angle and then rotated to a vertical position . Again , the supporting clips will snap into place.5 . Replace the cover , plug in the computer , and turn it on . In some computers , you will see the amount of RAM scroll by , confirming that the computer has recognized the new memory . If the memory has not been installed properly , there may be error messages , or the computer may freeze . If anything seems abnormal , remove and reinstall the new memory . Once everything is running properly , you can hold down the ALT key while double-clicking on My Computer to see the System Properties screen which will confirm the amount of memory that your computer thinks is installed .",0

"What are eyebrows for ? from straigtdope.com : '' The consensus is that eyebrows keep moisture ( sweat , mostly , but also rain ) from running down one 's forehead and straight into the eyes .

There have been one or two comments from people who were , for one reason or another , temporarily without eyebrows who claimed the difference was noticeable . I 've always been content with that explanation . It may not have much impact on a modern human 's life , but next time you 're hunting ( or being hunted ) on the African savanna , try shaving off your eyebrows and see if salty sweat running in your eyes makes the task any more difficult .

"can wood be liquified ? well , it depends on what you mean by `` liquefied '' . most certainly it can be ground or sanded into a fine dust ( sawdust ) and then mixed with water - voila , liquified wood.on the other hand , if you mean melted , the way you melt ice or iron.. not really , no . wood is a pretty complex substance , with lots of different kinds of chemicals arranged into cells . chemically speaking , it 's mostly carbon and water , and trace amounts of a bazillion other chemicals . if you heat it up , some other chemical reactions will happen first ( combustion , for instance , in the presence of oxygen ) . in the absence of oxygen , you make charcoal if you heat wood to around 300C - the water evaporates away , the bonds break and all the other chemicals are driven out . what 's left is a chunk of solid , mostly ( 90 % ) carbon in noncrystalline or `` amorphous '' form . if you KEEP heating it , always without any oxygen because it 'll burn otherwise - eventually this stuff will melt , but solid carbon melts at around 3800C , which is getting pretty close to the temperature of the surface of the sun . so it 's pretty difficult to do , though if you increase the pressure , the melting temperature will go down - this is how they make synthetic diamonds.otherwise , wood can be `` liquefied '' through other chemical processes , such as decomposition/rotting - this is where oil comes from - but by the time it 's liquid , it hardly qualifies as wood anymore.so , i guess the short answer to the question is no , it ca n't be .",0

"As a Christian , how do you find balance between ... . ( see the details ) ? In my life , God has put a large number of persons in my life from a vast array of Christian Cults ... some whom I know and love very much . However , I find it very difficult to deal with this group of people . I accept people of separate belief systems without this challenge . Mostly , because Christian cults are preaching something that parallels Christian beliefs , but unfortunately is still wrong . I feel the sense of urgency to debunk what they are saying so as to prevent the young and impressionable ( in the Faith , etc ) from falling in their trap and being lost . Yet , Jesus tells us not to throw the Gospel at these people to be trampled upon . Where is the balance in this ? Anyone found a useful text or exercise on this ? Obviously Prayer and reading the Word come first ! Any particular scriptures you find helpful ? Anyone else had to deal much with these troubles ? I would love to hear from Schneb on this if anyone has him on speed dial . : -p People mean well ( though they do harm ) when they approach potential converts to Christianity by , abrasively , reminding them of their sinful standard of living.In the beginning of witnessing such 'ministering , ' my reaction was vexation of spirit because Jesus was never harsh with hurting people . The woman caught in adultery was not condemned by Jesus.When people surrounded her to carry out the brutal punishment of death by stoning , I can only imagine the fear of having a crowd of people on a mission to kill me for bad judgment ... for a bad call ... for a bad ( correctable ) choice . I can also imagine her relief to hear the noise of the crowd diminish as they listened to a lone , quiet voice of hope ( gently calling attention to their times of bad judgment ) and how they escaped punishment.True believers have to be that lone voice of hope , ( that balance ) to potential new converts subjected to the noise of those who do not minister in meekness . Paul stated in I Timothy 2:24 `` And the servant of the Lord must not strive ; but be gentle unto all men , apt to teach , patient , :25 In meekness instructing those who oppose themselves ; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth ; :26 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil , who are taken captive by him at his will . `` Therefore , as a Christian , when my thoughts lean toward harsh rebuke of those who mean well ( but do harm in their zealous ministry ) , I understand they need more instruction on how to minister in meekness . Lifting them in prayer and supplication to God ( that they become more sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit ) grants me peace from the torment of a vexed spirit .",0

"Did the Broncos lose or did the Steelers just win ? That 's always a tough question . Did the Broncos just not show up or was it the Steeler 's amazing play that shut 'em down ? My take : while the Steelers did play extremely well , the Broncos failed in every aspect of the game . Aside from Bailey and occasional glimpses of Lynch , I did n't see a single Broncos player play well . Here are my top reasons why the Broncos lost on Sunday : # 1 reason : Jake Plummer . with two fumbles and two interceptions , he totally folded . Tough to overome that many turnovers . # 2 - defense . the Broncos could n't stop the Steelers ' running OR passing game # 3 - special teams . terrible by the Broncos . Seemed like the Steelers always had excellent position and the Broncos never did .",0

"Why are so many blacks calling each other the N-word when they hate it so much ? Seems like a double standard. ? Even the mayor of New Orleans called it a `` chocolate '' city . From my perspective , it has nothing to do with any one person or group finding a term `` offensive . '' It has everything to do with wanting POWER.One form or POWER is the `` double standard , '' in which one group of people can engage in some activity or speech which another group can not . There have been double standards since the dawn of time , and to this day , you will hear women complain about the double-standards about men 's sexual behavior and their general assertiveness as compared to that of women . A newer incarnation of the double standard is political correctness , in which one group of people attempt to control and limit the words or thoughts of another.When one group can effectively limit the ability of of another to do the same , the first group `` feels '' a sense of control or power . I say `` feels '' because any such quest for power , based in the desire to forbid another person from saying a particular 6-letter word is a misguided and inconsequential exertion of power . it really changes nothing ( at least in the short term ) . About the only thing it accomplishes is inflicting a sense of guilt on the intended target . If you 're motivated by guilt , it has worked . In the scheme of things , it 's minor . You can choose to fight it if you want , but to do so involves incurring the wrath of a politcally-correct society , who has accepted , for whatever reason , the argument from the messenger that this restriction should be enforced , not legally , but socially , via scorn , derision and ostracization . That may mean losing friends , losing your job , or quite possibly losing points on Yahoo Answers ( or even your entire account ) .So that 's the way I see it . And If the people who are trying to control the speech , be they black or female , or whatever , really look at it objectively , they ca n't help but admit that there 's a grasp for a modicum of power involved .",0

"Are there other active geysers in the world besides Yellowstone 's Old Faithful ? Here is an excerpt from a great reference on Geysers : A geyser is a hot spring that periodically erupts , throwing water into the air . Though that sounds simple , geysers are extremely rare . As of December 2005 , the total of active geysers on earth number approximately 1000.Conditions must be just right for geysers to occur . Three components must be present for geysers to exist : an abundant supply of water , an intense source of heat , and unique plumbing . Water is common in nature , heat can come from volcanic activity , but the plumbing is critical . For water to be thrown into the air , geyser plumbing must be water- and pressure-tight . Geyser scientists and observers have identified the volcanic rock rhyolite as being particularly effective at hosting geysers . Rhyolite is high in silica , which can deposit a water-tight seal along the walls of the geyser plumbing . Most of the geyser fields in the world are found in rhyolite or similar silica-laden rocks ( like ignimbrite ) . The mixture of water , volcanic heat , and plumbing is exceptional at Yellowstone National Park . Over one-half of the world 's geysers are located within the park 's boundaries.It is increasingly apparent that geysers must possess a fourth characteristic to exist : remoteness . Within the last fifty years , volcanic heat and abundant water have been increasingly harnessed to turn turbines for electricity production . Geothermal energy can be produced at any site where volcanic heat and water are readily available . Unfortunately , geyser fields are ideal for this type of energy production . Geothermal energy production steals the geysers ' water , and destroys geyser activity ( for example , Wairakei , New Zealand ) . A growing threat to geysers stems from mineral extraction . Hot groundwater may precipitate gold or other valuable minerals , and extraction may require removing the geyser plumbing itself . For example , in May 2003 , mineral exploration at South America ’ s second largest geyser field ( Puchuldiza , Chile ) , caused cessation in the field ’ s geysers . Few realize the actual rarity of geysers . As a result , many geyser fields have been destroyed and many others are being threatened . LocationsYellowstone National Park ( USA ) Valley of Geysers , Kamchatka Peninsula ( Siberia ) El Tatio ( Chile ) North Island , New ZealandIcelandBeowawe Geyser Field , Nevada ( USA ) Steamboat Springs , Nevada ( USA ) Umnak Island , Alaska ( USA ) Other World GeysersAt least a dozen additional locations worldwide are known to contain between one and fourteen geysers .

what is a double layer DVD burner ? Movie DVDs you buy in the store can contain up to 8.5 gigabytes of data . This is because they are pressed ( as opposed to burned ) dual-layer DVDs ( also called DVD-9 ) . The recordable DVD+-Rs that have been on the market for a while a single-layer DVD-5s and can store up to 4.7 gigabytes . This disrepency is why programs that copy movie DVDs need to compress the DVD content after unencrypting it before they can be burned to a normal DVD . Recently new DVD burners and media were introduced that allowed people to burn DVD-9 DVDs reasonably affordably.So a double-layer DVD burner is one that is capable of burning 8.5 gigabyte DVD-9 format DVDs.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd # Technical_information,0

"What is igneous rock ? The term comes from the Latin word `` Ignis '' which means fire . Igneous rocks are produced by melting within the earth and later cooling of the molten magma.There are two major subdivisions of igneous rocks : ExtrusiveIntrusiveExtrusive igneous rocks come from volcanic activity . They are `` extruded ' by being ejected from a volcano or being part of a slow moving lava flow on the surface of the earth . Examples : basalt flows , pumice , obsidian , ash , scoriaIntrusive igneous rocks are formed by these molten rocks as they cool within the earth . The slow cooling allows the rock to separate into different minerals and form grains . Large masses of intrusive rocks that harden within the earth are called batholiths and plutons , depending on the size . Examples of intrusive igneous rocks are granite , gabbro , and monzonite .

To avoid Indians , they traveled as silently as possible until they reached a settled area . Then they unmuffled bells hung around their horses necks to announce their arrival to outlying cabins . Hence , `` I 'll be there with bells on .

"what is the purpose of throwing of beads at the Mardi Gras mean ? New Orleans ' Mardi Gras revelers will spend today downing Hurricanes , gawking at naked flesh , and begging paraders for colored beads with the traditional plea , `` Throw me something , mister ! '' How did the bead-throwing custom begin ? The first recorded instances of Mardi Gras paraders tossing souvenirs to the crowd date back to the 1840s , when revelers costumed as aristocrats threw out baubles and sugar-coated almonds . Other , less savory characters preferred `` trick '' to `` treat '' and pelted onlookers with an assortment of dirt , flour , and quicklime . The dissemination of handouts—or `` throws , '' in Mardi Gras parlance—is widely believed to have derived from festival customs in Renaissance Europe , where pre-Lenten carnivals often involved projectiles ( hurled about after villagewide ale-and-mead binges ) . Some historians theorize that the tradition has roots in a pagan post-winter ritual , during which lucky peasants who 'd survived the cold months celebrated by throwing milled grain into the fields—an offering of gratitude to the deity ( or deities ) who had given them enough food to last.Glass beads did not become a New Orleans Mardi Gras staple until the 1880s , after Anglo-American `` krewes '' had formed to organize the loose-knit festivities . Legend has it that the first parade participant to use beads was a man dressed up as Santa Claus ; the ornamental strands were such a hit that other krewes picked up on the ritual . By 1900 , when at least 100,000 tourists a year flocked to the Crescent City for Mardi Gras , beaded throws were ubiquitous.Continue Articlewhy you fly nationalToday 's plastic-or-aluminum beads have earned substantial notoriety for their role in a sexual bartering system ; women often bare their breasts for a strand or two . ( And sometimes go the Full Monty for a particularly enticing throw . ) Despite claims that this custom dates back decades , a 1996 paper in the academic journal Social Forces could trace the beads-for-nudity movement only back to the 1970s.Bonus Explainer : A krewe known as `` Zulu '' has become famous for handing out ( not throwing ) Mardi Gras coconuts in lieu of beads . The practice ceased briefly in the 1980s , owing to liability concerns—no insurance company would cover Zulu , fearing that an errant coconut might dent a merrymaker 's skull . Zulu leaders appealed to the Louisiana state legislature , pointing out that beads and other Mardi Gras trinkets were exempted from liability laws . In 1987 , then-Governor Edwin Edwards signed the `` Coconut Bills , '' adding Zulu 's heavy , oblong handouts to the list .",0

"how dies gravity really work ? Just to expand on the answer by `` twertyto '' , the answer to your question is `` We do n't know yet '' . This is one of the major questions in physics right now . There are some ideas but none of them have been proven either mathematically or in laboratory experiment . It is believed by most leading minds in physics that once we learn the exact relationship between gravity and the other known forces ( electromagnetic , strong nuclear and weak nuclear ) , we will then understand how gravity works . To understand this relationship will take what is called the `` grand unified theory '' , which is not yet a theory at all but a hoped-for theory to be developed in the near future . The `` grand unified theory '' would explain how gravity is related to mass and energy and the `` known forces '' mentioned above , and would do for gravity what Einstein 's `` E=MC2 '' ( relativity ) did for understanding the relationship between mass and energy . ( Some quick background : E=MC2 explained the exact relationship between mass and energy , showing they are both different aspects of the same thing , and can therefore be converted into each other ) . To sum this up in a simple fashion : scientists believe that gravity , energy , mass and even time are all made of the same `` stuff '' at some super-fundamental level , but they have n't yet figured out this fundamental level . Once someone does ( which would pretty much be a guaranteed Nobel prize ) , we will know how gravity works . Until then , we can only speculate .",0

"Why do electrical outlets have 2 different sized sockets ? Wall sockets have AC voltages , so there is no positive and negative . One of the two prongs has what is called `` Hot '' , and the other is called `` Neutral '' . The Neutral is connected to ground back at a distribution center , while the Hot is 110 Volts AC ( in the U.S. ) . By the time it gets to your home , the Neutral is not quite ground anymore , but is still relatively safe- wheras the Hot is quite dangerous and potentially deadly.Some appliances are designed to have extra protection between the Hot and people . For example , a light socket has the 'threads ' ( the easily touched part ) connected to Neutral . As another example , most appliances and the light switches disconnect the Hot when they are off.The different sizes of the sockets prevent you from plugging an applicance in backwords . If you did this , then the switch would disconnect the Neutral instead , and leave the Hot on- making the device less safe .",0
"whats the difference between distance and gravitational pull ? whats the difference between distance and gravitational pull I think you 're asking about the relationship between distance and gravitational pull.Gravitational pull weakens as the distance increases . The farther you are away from an object , the weaker the gravitational pull will be.We say that gravity is `` inversely proportional '' to distance - meaning as distance increases , gravity decreases , and as distance decreases , gravity increases.More specificially , gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance - meaning that if the distance increases by a factor of 2 , gravity decreases by a factor of 4 , and if the distance increases by a factor of 3 , gravity decreases by a factor of 9 .",0
"is a person taking antispychotic medication allowed to take a polygraph test and get a resonable reading ? when a person has a mental disorder that requires antispychotic medication , be allowed to take a polygraph test ? Who is doing the test , and why is it being done ? I do not do polygraph tests , however , I have had clients take them . Usual protocol is for the examiner to ask what medications the subject has taken . If the examiner does not ask , volunteer the information . The test itself takes readings of blood pressure , respiration , etc. , which may be affected by the medication , and therefore throw off the results.The real question is what the mental disorder is , and whether it would affect the ability of the subject to tell truth from fiction . The polygraph is designed to show when the subject is stating something the subject knows is untrue . If the subject `` knows '' men from Mars are controlling his thoughts , he will show as truthful when asked if he knows whether there is life on Mars .",0

"What is gravity ? A simple answer : it is the force exerted by two bits of matter on each other , pulling them towards each other . The size of the force is F=G*M*m/r^2 , where M is the mass of one object , m is the mass of the other , r is how far apart they are , and G is the universal gravitational constant.Einstein described gravity as a `` well '' created by mass -- a deformation of the shape of the universe that changed how particles moved like the bumps and valleys in a miniature golf course change the movement of your golf ball.At another level , gravity is one of the four basic forces in nature ; it 's the one that , at the moment , is probably best described and perhaps least understood .

"What is a Rife Generator and how does it work ? I 'll post here my answer that I gave when another person asked the same question a month or so ago.The Rife machine is legit depending on what model or manufacturer you got it from . There was a company in the late 80 's to early 90 's called LER that made what they named the REM SuperPro Generator . Though I ca n't vouch for any of the newer models , I can say that Rife 's technology was right on if you can find an original model.YES it shattered cancer cells , YES he was heralded as having found the cure for all diseases , YES he had 100 % success rate on the patients in the Pasadena county hospital . A Rife machine uses scalar waves , along the now established fact that every organism operates at its own distinct frequency . By increasing the resonance , a particular organism can be destroyed without harming the tissue around it . Rife meticulousy recorded the M.O.R . ( mortal oscillatory rate ) for the thousands of micro-organisms he could see under his universal microscope . A properly built Rife frequency generator can not hurt , except for a brief healing crisis , followed by an incredible feeling of health and well-being taken from years of testimonials ( unless you have a pacemaker from what I 've heard ) . A good amount of reading on Rife 's story can be found at some of the links below.Unfortunately most of his work was destroyed because of the newly created AMA and FDA that came into power . They ruled Rife 's work did not fall under their now established guidelines for medical practice , and with the government to back them up , it was the end for his discovery .",0

"My 4th grade son is haveing MAJOR difficulties at school and I 'm considering homeschooling him.Any ideas ? I 'm having problems with the principal and I 've even talked to the superintendent . I do n't expect much help there but if they 're going to label my son as a `` troublemaker '' or someone who needs `` more counselling than just talking to a therapist '' ( the prinipal told me she thinks he should be `` institutionalized '' which the counsellor even disagrees with ) then I do n't see the point of putting him back into that situation . I live in a very small rural town with very limited counselling options which I am taking advantage of . I do n't have too many disciplinary problems with him at home but at school he 's been having `` meltdowns '' which have caused him to be suspended 2 times in the past 2 weeks plus a 5 day suspension for a comment he supposedly said . I ca n't move him to a nearby town 's school because they do n't accept kids after the start of the second semester . I just want him to pass 4th grade so he can go on to 5th grade with a different principal and hopefully a better prospect . HELP ! I went through a very similar situation and after months of being told by the teacher and the principal that there must be a problem at home , I found out another child was having the same problems mine was . The other mom and I got together and came up with a plan . We each got our child to tell us why the other child was having so much trouble.Turned out there was another child in the class bullying and intimidating ours so badly that there were days they spent all their time huddled under their desks . While I still could not get the school to admit to a problem , I did find a sympathetic vice principal who allowed my child access to her office at any time he felt he could not handle being in the class anymore . It was n't the perfect solution but it got us to the end of that school year and I made sure I had some say in what class he went into the next year . Things improved after that . If you truly are not having discipline problems at home and the only place there really seems to be a problem is at school , then I would be looking very hard at why there is a problem at school . Do n't take the teacher 's word for anything ... that teacher may very well be the problem . Talk to other parents and find out if anyone else is going through something similar to what you are . Make sure your child understands that you know there is a problem and you are doing your best to help . Let him know he has you on his side . Good luck . Sure would like to know the outcome of this one .",0
"is this sentance grammatically correct ? The subject of Shakespeare ’ s “ Sonnet 29 ” and Shelley ’ s Frankenstein find themselves in a state of loneliness , which incites strong emotions in them . Sonnet 29 has one subject and Frankenstein has another subject . That 's two subjects , so the noun `` subject '' should be plural instead of singular . Their strong emotions are incited by one thing , their `` state . '' Thus , `` incites '' should be singular , which it is.The 6:58 version is correct .",0

"World of Warcraft -- which class ? Hi ! what class out of mage and rogue do you think is the best ? i personally like rogue best , but lately i tried the mage , and it was kick butt . what do you think ? and what race ( and profession ) is the best for that class ? Both are played alot , and both do great damage . But I think later on it would be better to do Mage instead Rogue . A Mage will have an easier time finding a party for things like instances such as UBRS , LBRS , MC , ect . Human would be a good race because of the extra reputation they gain.. As far as profession , Enchanting is always good because either you can make gold off the enchanting supplies or enchanting other 's items or your own . Cloth working is another great profession beings you would wear cloth and you will be able to make yourself some awsome robes , ect later on . Mages are `` wtfpwn '' or so they say , also alot of fun ... I have alot of lvl 60 's on the Silvermoon server and Mage was always a fun class of mine , hardly anyone could beat me , as on my other alts I was hardly ever able to beat a Mage . If you ever go onto the Silvermoon server , I am always either on Druidess ( Druid ) on Alliance side or Kelpie ( Rogue ) on the Horde side . I 'm always willing to help . Just pick whatever you enjoy playing the most . All of them are fun in their own way.. and if you like to solo alot you would have an easier time on Rogue but later on when you want your class sets you would have an easier time as Mage to get them .",0

"Why does the days in the Georgian Calendar differ with the dates every year ? ? The traditional Chinese one isnt The traditional Chinese calendar does not contain “ weeks ” . In ancient China government officials enjoyed a day off for every ten days . The week system was introduced into China , I guess , only in early last century along with the Gregorian calendar . According to the Chinese calendar , a year has 12 months and a month has 29 or 30 days . If a month has 29 days , we call it the lesser month ; if 30 days – the greater month . Each of the 12 months of a certain year can be lesser or greater , depending on the astronomical calculation . There is no special name to each month ; they are identified by the ordinal numbers ( 1 to 12 ) . If you want to know , for example , whether the second month of the next Chinese year ( or lunar year ) is a lesser or greater one , you have to consult an almanac or a perpetual calendar . There is an intercalary month arranged for every three years ( approximately ) . An intercalary year has 13 months . That ’ s the outline of the Chinese calendar . And it may be obvious that the Chinese calendar can not match its dates to the week 's days .",0
"Who ran the fastest forty ever at the combine ? A couple of my guesses would be Deion , Darrell Green , maybe even Mike Vick . Also , who do you think ran the fastest forty ever ... .not just at the combine . There is no official world record for 40 yards.The shortest distance that the IAAF , track and field 's international governing body , recognizes for world-record purposes is an indoor 50 meters , or about 54 yards . It is 5.56 seconds and it was set by Canadian sprinter Donovan Bailey in 1996 . There is also a world record for 60 meters -- 6.39 seconds by American Maurice Greene in 1998.But it is another Canadian , Ben Johnson , who is believed to have run 40 yards faster than any human in history . Johnson is best known for injecting copious amounts of steroids and winning the 100 meters at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul in 9.79 seconds , only to have his gold medal and world record stripped after failing a post-race drug test.Timing officials have since broken down that famed race into 10-meter increments , and Johnson was so preposterously fast that he went through 50 meters in 5.52 seconds and 60 meters in 6.37 -- both under the current world records at those distances . He went through 40 yards that day in 4.38 seconds.He was running in spikes . . . on a warm afternoon perfectly suited for sprinting . . . with a slight tailwind . . . with years of training from arguably track 's top coach , Charlie Francis . . . with Carl Lewis and six others of the fastest men on the planet chasing him . . . with 69,000 people roaring at Seoul 's Olympic Stadium . . . with hundreds of millions of people watching on TV . . . with the ultimate prize in sports , an Olympic gold medal , at stake.And , as we learned later , with muscles built with the assistance of the anabolic steroid stanazolol.Four-point-three-eight seconds.Then again , maybe Ben Johnson is n't the fastest 40-yard man in the world.Maybe half the NFL is faster.o o oIt can be the most important few hours of a football player 's career . It is the day NFL scouts come to campus to determine whether prospects have what it takes to play at the next level.Players are measured to the quarter-inch . They 're weighed to the half-pound . They do a vertical jump and a standing broad jump . They see how many times they can bench-press 225 pounds . They do a 20-yard shuttle drill and something called a three-cone drill . They are put through a short workout specific to their position.But it is something else that commands everyone 's attention , something else that interrupts the businesslike atmosphere of players shuffling from one station to the next . Something else that causes scouts and spectators to snap to attention.The 40-yard dash.It is the day 's shortest event , and the most critical . No other statistic carries more influence for an NFL prospect , no single number has more impact on his draft fortunes . It 's not called Pro Scouting Day or Pro Prospect Day or Pro Workout Day . The sign taped to the weight-room door at San Diego State on March 19 says : `` Pro Timing Day . `` Or as local football agent David Caravantes puts it : `` There 's football speed and there 's 40 speed , and the scouts will all tell you they understand that and game film is the most important thing . But how many defensive backs who ran a 4.6 are left on the draft board ahead of guys who ran 4.3 ? `` I 'll give you another example . There 's this DB who was originally projected as a first-rounder . But he did n't run the 40 that fast -- something like 4.6 instead of in the 4.4s -- and now they 're talking about him slipping to the second round . Well , he 's looking at a minimum $ 4 million signing bonus if he goes in the first round and only about $ 1.6 million if he goes in the middle of the second round . `` You do the math . `` The players are inside the SDSU weight room being measured and weighed .

"How would a true antichrist act like , and are there any right now ? I want to know what differentiates an antichrist from a dictator . I think the ( or an ) antichrist would act in a pay of a pursuader . A sutle character who warms his/her way gaining trust only to abuse it . If the anitchrist is against christ then I think he/she would have these charateristics to get into the christians lives to test them most , with their love and trust .

I am a Bahai , it is not any branch of any other relegion .The Baha'i Faith is the youngest of the world 's independent religions . It is based on the teachings of Baha'u'llah ( 1817-1892 ) , Who is regarded by Baha'is as the most recent in a line of Messengers of God that includes Abraham , Moses , Buddha , Zoroaster , Christ , and Muhammad.Baha'u'llah taught that there is only one God and one human family , that all religions represent progressive stages in the revelation of God 's Will , and that humanity is reaching its long-awaited stage of maturity , when a peaceful and just world order can finally be realized.While restating the ethical and spiritual principles common to all religions , Baha'u'llah revealed new social principles and laws to lay the foundation of a global civilization . We invite everyone , regardless of race , religion or ethnicity , to study , worship and work with us to bring into reality the vision of humanity as one global family and the earth as one home.you might find a Bahai community or center in your city : )",0

"What kind of socks should I wear for a 6 mile hike ? A six mile hike is really no big deal , but you are prone to getting blisters in your feet , here 's a recomendation from a Marine medic ; wear thin silk socks , then thicker cotton socks directly over them .

"Is there a dallas bias ? Do the Dallas Cowboys have a bias against them with the media in the rest of the country ? I do n't think that a bias necessarily exists within the media , but among fans I believe there sure are a lot of Cowboys haters . There are several reasons for this . For one , there is a little bit of jealousy for `` America 's Team '' . These feelings are still carrying over from their dynasty in the 90 's ( and even the 70s ) . Also , the organization has had many abrasive characters : owner Jerry Jones , the Tuna , ex-stars such as Michael Irvin , and the myriad of criminals and druggies they 've paraded through in the last 10/15 years . As with any great sports organization , fans are very polarized ... you either love 'em or hate 'em . I love 'em , but conversely I despise great competing teams such as the Steelers and 49ers . Some in the media may have their beef with Jerry Jones or other people in the organization , but I think the strong anti-Dallas emotion is mainly among the fans ( which is a tribute to the Cowboys being one of the top teams in the sport ) .",0

"Why do non-smokers want to be around smokers , just to have it banned in clubs and pool halls ? ? ? ? In the Chicagoland area it is a ban in nightclubs , bars , pool halls and every where else that smokers goto to have fun . Its the same in Madison , Wis . There is a smoking ban just about everywhere you go . If you are a non-smoker then dont frequent places where smokers are and vice-versa for smokers . Everyone has the right to smoke if they want . They say smoking causes second hand Canser , well if that is so then seeing people eat to much causes eye canser . You all know what I mean . I do n't think that smoking should be banned in bars and in clubs . If they are banning things that are bad for you they would n't be able to drink there either . I think that if you are so health oriented you should n't be in the bar so if you do n't want to be around smokers do n't go in the bar . Drinking and smoking go hand in hand and some people that drink like to smoke only when they drink . I think it should be up to the bar owner . If the waitresses do n't like being around it , get another job at a bar that does n't allow smoking .",0

"while visiting Appomattox I noticed that the grave markers were covered with coins . What is the reason for thi There are many theories why people place coins and other `` offerings '' on headstones . I have seen this at many historic sites , Calvin Coolidge grave etc.1 . Some say money left at graveside goes back to the coins left at graves in ancient Greece to pay Charon , for ferry passage over the River Styx to Hades.2 . It is a widespread custom to leave a small remembrance as a sign of respect in many cultures.3 . It may be a secular version of the Jewish tradition of putting a pebble on the gravestone to show remembrance and respect.In `` The Jewish Home : a guide for Jewish living : by Daniel B. Syme it says the following : > > '' In biblical times , ... graves were sometimes marked by a pile of stones . Some scholars suggest that this may explain the custom of leaving pebbles . There is no religious basis for the practice . It serves to indicate that loved ones have been to the grave , and that alone is sufficient cause to justify it . At least one contemporary rabbi , however , has suggested that leaving a stone may also have therapeutic benefit for us , especially if we see it as a symbolic means of leaving behind some of the 'hardness ' of grief and pain .

"President Kennedy a gread pres. ? Why specifically is President Kennedy remembered as such a great President ? What was his greatest achievement ? He was charismatic , but he was n't a great president.His unplanned remarks to Nikita Khruschev , President of the Soviet Union , caused Khruschev to judge Kennedy to be weak . Consequently , he installed nuclear missles in Cuba . Kennedy reacted by blockading Cuba . For several days in October 1963 , the world was on the brink of a nuclear war.Shortly after taking office , he allowed plans for an invasion of Cuba to proceed . The invasion by Cuban refugees from Miami was a debacle that was a violation of international law and a humiliation to the United States.He continued the program of sending military advisors to Viet Nam . After his death , this was continued by President Lyndon Johnson and expanded into the Viet Nam war . The Viet Nam war destroyed Johnson 's presidency.To his great credit , he was aggressive about furthering the Civil Rights movement by supporting activists with Federal authority in several high profile integration efforts.If he had lived , almost surely he would have been elected to a second term . He seemed to grow wiser while in office . Would that wisdom have led him to become a great president ? Would the US have become bogged down in an unwinnable war in Viet Nam ? Would his philandering have brought him down ? Interesting questions.Wikipedia knows all.I was 10 when he was elected and 13 when he was assassinated . I will never forget the optimism he brought to the country . We believed he could lead us into the bright future . I will never forget the terror of the Cuban Missle Crisis . I will never forget the devastation I felt when he was assassinated . The United States has not been the same since . John Kennedy was the last president who _lead_ us . Presidents after him have been followers without vision.In 1989 ( I was 39 ) , I went to President Kennedy 's grave in Arlington Cemetary . Probably 15 or 20 people were there . I was amazed that people were moved to silence , even those obviously born after his presidency . I felt a great deal of reverence and had tears in my eyes .",0

"Will a turbo fit on a carburettor engin ? Will a turbo fit on a carburettor engin , and if so will it be as effective as with fuel injection engines ? If you know will you please tell me what mods I have to do on my engine if I put a low presure turbo on . Turbos can ( and have ) been put on carb 'd cars . However , due to the increased control using today 's electronics , I ca n't see them as being as effective as FI turbocharged . When you increase the airflow to the engine ( turbocharging and supercharging are forced induction ) you must increase the fuel as well , otherwise you will end up in an incredibly lean condidtion and damage the motor . Motors work best with a specific air/fuel ratio . With carbs you must re jet for the best compromised AFR . With FI you can `` map '' the fuel to maintain the best AFR over the entire range of RPM . Other mods will include oiling system changes ( you need to make sure the turbo will live ) . Hope this helps .",0

"Why is an abortion so easy to get ? Although I think abortion should remain legal , I think it should be harder to get one . All you need is $ 500 .

[ You ca n't even get your EARS peirced without parental consent . ] Maybe there should be mandatory counseling before and after . Before to go throught he options in handling an unwanted pregnancy ( adoption and so forth ) . And then after to deal with emotional effects of the abortion .

"was the 11th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , UN-Constitutionally adopted ? Was the Amendment UN-Constitutional because it was not in Pursuance of the Original Constitution ?

Can someone tell me when Google Earth update the Images ? Images on of my City Chandigarh are Six months old . Google gets its imagery from several different sources . It is my understanding that they buy the imagery from private companies such as DigitalGlobe and EarthSat/MDA . It is my understanding that they are able to get this imagery at a greater bargain since they do n't necessarily request high resolution of specific areas . Rather they just take the imagery that these company 's other clients have already requested and had tasked . As such Google rolls new imagery as it becomes more easily available from the companies . That is why areas outside of the US have less high resolution imagery -- because there are not other client requesting and paying for that information to be collected .,0

"Will someday the idea of human cloning will be legal ? Right now , it 's just an idea . But who knows in the future suddenly we found someone that looks very identical to us like our twin ! There is too much movie out there that depict this phenom , is n't it ? So how we can sure that this is not possible to be legal in the future ? Hi there , You are absolutely right . It is likely that Human Cloning will be accepted in the future . Just think of it ... Would n't it be wonderful to clone persons like Einstein , Socrates , and other great people who have influenced this world ? But I think there must be restrictions on whom to clone . If not , the population of this world will rise rapidly . Also , it will give rise to unnecessary chaos and disorder regarding who is who . And I also think the technology should be known to a limited number of scientists , because there is a likely chance of illegal cloning ( as in the movie 'The Sixth Day ' ) If every person gets to know the technology , he can take the creation into his own hands , and so all the unethical things are likely to happen . So , on the whole , Human Cloning is n't a bad idea , provided there are 'proper ' laws made and 'implemented ' , and people think rationally.rule wid style n luv @ vinnyEdit : Well , I do agree with you that a lot depends on the society and the brought-up of the person , but I was just trying to bring out a point there .

"What is Rational Unified Process ( RUP ) ? how does it relate to project management ? RUP is a standardized software development process . It had its origins in the unified modeling language . Rational Corp. took the UML and developed a standardized process for implementing projects in a series of iterations based on its UML tools . IBM bought Rational and continued RUP development . IBM recently donated part of its RUP intellectual property to the open source community . See link in sources for more info.The second part of your question is a little harder . How RUP relates to project managment is that RUP is a process . It defines the steps to be taken to produce a product and it defines the deliverables to be produced at each phase . So , the relationship between RUP and project management is RUP defines the artifacts to be produced and PM strives to manage the cost and schedule associated with producing those artifacts .",0
"How would you explain the word , Elysium ? and what other words mean the same ? In Greek mythology , Elysium was a section of the Underworld ( the spelling Elysium is a Latinization of the Greek word Elysion ) . `` Elysium is an obscure and mysterious name that evolved from a designation of a place or person struck by lightning , enelysion , enelysios . ( Burkert 1985 p. 198 ) The Elysian fields , or sometimes Elysian plains , were the final resting place of the souls of the heroic and the virtuous . Two passages in Homer established for Greeks the nature of the Afterlife : the dreamed apparition of the dead Patroclus in the Iliad and the more daring boundary-breaking visit in Odyssey . Greek traditions concerning funerary ritual were reticent , but the Homeric examples encouraged other heroic visits , in the myth cycles accreted upon Theseus and upon Heracles ( Campbell 1948 ; Ruck and Staples 1994 ) .The Elysian Fields lay on the western margin of the earth , by the encircling stream of Oceanus ( Odyssey ) , and there the mortal relatives of the king of the gods were transported , without tasting death , to enjoy an immortality of bliss ( Odyssey book iv : 563 ) . Hesiod refers to the Isles of the Blessed ( makarôn nêsoi ) in the Western Ocean ( Works and Days ) . Pindar makes it a single Isle . Walter Burkert notes the connection with the motif of far-off Dilmun : `` Thus Achilles is transported to the White Isle and becomes the Ruler of the Black Sea , and Diomedes becomes the divine lord of an Adriatic island . '' ( Burkert 1985 , p. 198 ) .In Elysium were fields of the pale liliaceous asphodel , and poplars grew . There stood the gates that led to the house of Ais ( in Attic dialect `` Hades '' ) .",0

"what do you do yourself to cut down your appetite ? The basics of most nutrition booksDon ’ t starve yourself . That ’ s the worst thing you can do in a diet because it slows down your metabolism and your body starts getting more fat from your food intake since , fat is the bodies fastest and easiest type of nutrition [ not the healthiest though ] . The reason this happen is because this helped us when we were no doing so good as hunters and gathers to keep us alive a bit longer . Before I continue let me explain protein , carbohydrates , and fats.Protein is easiest described as anything that comes from or was an animal such chicken , fish , sirloin , and milk . Carbohydrates [ carbs ] can be found almost in anything else even apples.Good carbs : Apples , wheat bread , sourdough bread , grains , and wheat Bad carbs : White bread , hamburger buns , hotdog buns , Doritos , and sodas ! Good fats : Avocados , pecans , almonds , and peanut butter The ratio in your diet varies but I think a good starting point is something like [ 50 % Protien:40 % Carbs:10 % fat ] This can sound meaningless . So in plain terms consume only good fats [ portioned ] and you should be okay . Something like a handful of almonds , or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [ separately . not consecutively ] . The reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because you are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [ Proteins are 4 calories , Carbs are 4 calories , Fats are 9 calories ] so theoretically if you eat less fats and more proteins you will have a less appetite because you will eat more . Another nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself . That ’ s how the Adkins basically works . If you consume more proteins and less carbs you will lose weight . I leave to you to decide if this is good you.I would also advice you to split up your day into 5 meals . [ warning : it will feel weird because you are not used to eating this decreased amount . Just keep in mind that you will eat in 3 hour and you will quickly noticed that you will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry ] if you do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla.You are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [ if you have been starving yourself or if you don ’ t exercise ] .",0

"what does an r3 code mean on a military dd214 in terms of re-enlistment ? It really depends on which branch of service you were in . In the Navy if you had an RE-3 it was usually followed with a letter code such as RE-3P which meant you got out on a physical . I got out with an RE-3Z which meant that I took SSB/VSI . As far as re-enlistment goes it really depends on the letter code that comes after . If you got an RE-3P for a shoulder injury and you want to come back in a few years after it heals ... maybe no problem . If you got out on a 3P for something more serious or dependancy ( drug/alcohol ) it seriously reduces your chances of re-enlistment . But do n't forget that each service has their own codes . So see your local recruiter first . The Marine Corps has only one code that is good for immediate re-enlistment ( RE-1A ) , anything other than that will keep you out of the Corps , but not necessarily out of the National Guard ( for example ) . If your particular RE code keeps you out of your original branch , check out other branches and do n't forget Guard and Reserves . Good luck in your military career .",0

Every single time she thinks about braking up with him she cant shes been saying the same thing for about for half a year and nothing happened some edvice please ? ? If she ca n't break up with him I believe that only means she has developed feelings for him , or else it would have been a lot easier for her . Otherwise , she might be feeling sorry for him assuming he might get upset and hurt , which also means she 's with him for the wrong reasons . If your friend has no feelings for him , and is not attached to him emotionally , then she should leave him and be fair to him , and most importantly to herself .",0
"Can someone please explain me the blowfish algorithm ? Hi , I am using the blowfish algorithm for my project . I read the paper that Bruce wrote , but couldnt understand it fully ... .Can please some explain it to me ? ? Please ... dont paste the same thing that is on the website , tell me what you understand ! Thankyou ! ! ! IT is a Copy Paste But may be of some use ... .BlowFishBlowFish/TwoFish is a widespread security algorithm , which was published by Bruce Schneier in the beginning of the year 1994 . This algorithm works similar to DES and it uses block coding with blocks of a size of 64 bit . BlowFish was spread very fast after its publication , due to the fact that Bruce Schneier is one of the most famous cryptology experts and that this algorithm can be used without licence fee . In addition , using this algorithm data can be en- and decoded with high speed . If the routine for BlowFish is implemented in software , a disk space of less than five kilobytes is sufficient . You can vary the size of the key as as you like up to 448 bit . That is why this algorithm with its 2 448 different possibilities is protected against any Brute Force Attacks . This is how the encryption algorithm BlowFish works : BlowFish defines two different S boxes , a P box and four S boxes . The P box P is a one-dimensional field with 18 32-bit-values . The boxes contain accidental values , which are implemented in the code or generated during each initialization . The S boxes S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 contain 256 32-bit-values each . The BlowFish initialization looks like this : The key string is converted into 32-bit-values . The entire content of the P box is substituted by the values xor ’ t . The P box is now encrypted like the S box . BlowFish encryption ( block size : 64 Bit , rounds ( r ) : 16 ) : The data element is divided into two parts L and R , each of 32 bit . L is xor ’ t with P r. R is xor ’ t with f ( L ) . L and R are interchanged . This is done 16 times , until r =16 . R is xor ’ t with P 17 . L is xor ’ t with P 18 . Explanation of function f : The incoming 32-bit-value ( L in this case ) is divided into four 8-bit-vectors X1 , X2 , X3 , X4 . With the help of these vectors a 32-bit-value is selected from every S box . The result is linked by addition and xor . For decoding data , the entire process is performed the other way round .",0

"Which would you be : rich or poor ? Rich , you are wealthy . Poor your the average citizen.Tell me why you would be either ( Rich-Good or Bad , Poor-Good or Bad ) . There really is no Black or White answer to this question . Even though , I am sure there are many `` rich '' people in the world who are nice , I 've seen many more who are not so much . In my experience , money has a tendency to change people , even when that person has the best intentions at heart . Although I would love to have more money , I would never wish to be `` rich '' , only comfortable enough to be able to support myself , with no loose ends . I may be going agains the grain , here with my answer , but I think I lean more towards `` poor '' . Those who are poor , or live from paycheck to paycheck , tend to appreciate the small things as we all should . `` Poor '' people do not care about having extravagant houses or 5 cars , one for each day of the week ; they are content with a roof over their family 's head , a meal for each night , and an old dependable clunker to get around in .",0

"A force of 12N is applied to the handle of a screw driver being used to pry the lid off a paint can.. ? As the force moves through a distance of 0.3m , the screwdriver does 3.2 J of work on the lid . What is the EFFICIENCY of the screwdriver ? How did you figure that out.. i cant not figure it out so if anyone can and explain how they did it that would be great . Thanks . ok , all you have to do is figure out how much work it should have been doing , then compare it to the amount of work it actually did by using a percentage . so first of all , W=Fx ( work equals Force times distance ) that means that W= ( 12 ) ( .3 ) =3.6 J of work . Ok , so since it only did 3.2 J , that means .4J were lost somewhere . the efficiency is calculating the efficiency in terms of what percentage of the work that was actually applied was translated into the work energy that was done on the lid . the way you do this is just divide the amount of work it did by the amount of work it should have done ( in an ideal solution ) and then multiply by 100 in order to find the percentage of work it actually did in relation to the work it should have done . 3.2/3.6= .88889 ( x 100 ) = 88.89 % . so basically , in cases with efficiency , you divide the number you solved for by the number they gave you . a good way to figure out which you divide by which is just to randomly try dividing and if the answer is above 1 ( 100 % ) , that 's impossible so you switch them ; )",0

This is a very good question.I do not think it should be required for citizenship , but I do think it could be tied into certain `` benefits '' . I firmly believe that true service would help most people , lower unemployment ( military training translates to outside employment ) , and lessen the `` gim me , gim me , gim me a handout '' crap that is very widespread . Why should people be given welfare when they are able bodied enough to serve in the military ? Why should people squeeze money from the Fed for schooling , when they can earn that benefit by serving in the armed forces ?",0
"how to computer work ? Here 's the simple version : Computers haveA brain ( CPU or central processing unit ) Memory StoragePeripheralsThe CPU is like an air traffic controller controlling all your requests and running all your programs.The Memory holds the programs - including your OS ( windows etc . ) and data temporarily for the CPU to access.Storage such as a hard disk drive holds information when it is too large or inconvenient to place in memory and when the computer is shut down.Peripherals : Keyboard , mouse , monitor , printer are what the computer uses to interact with the Human.The CPU manages all your interactions : running programs , copying files , surfing the web . It uses the resources it needs ( peripherals , memory , storage etc . ) to fulfill those requests . Imagine you have a private chef , who is locked in his own kitchen . You make a request to him . He produces the food and uses his resources , pots , pans ingredients , recipes etc . He 's like your CPU.It goes much further than that , but I hope that helps .",0

"why there is 28 days on Feburary ? February is the second month of the year in the Gregorian Calendar . It is the shortest Gregorian month and the only month with the length of 28 or 29 days . The month has 29 days in leap years , when the year number is divisible by four ( except for years that are divisible by 100 and not by 400 ) . In other years the month has 28 days.February begins , astronomically speaking , with the sun in the constellation of Capricornus and ends with the sun in the constellation of Aquarius . Astrologically speaking , February begins with the sun in the sign of Aquarius and ends in the sign of Pisces.February was named for the Roman god Februus , the god of purification . January and February were the last two months to be added to the Roman calendar , since the Romans originally considered winter a monthless period . This change was made by Numa Pompilius about 700 BC in order to bring the calendar in line with a standard lunar year . Numa 's Februarius contained 29 days ( 30 in a leap year ) . Augustus is alleged to have removed one day from February and added it to August , ( renamed from Sextilis to honor himself ) , so that Julius Caesar 's July would not contain more days . However there is little historical evidence to support this claim.February was nominally the last month of the Roman calendar , as the year originally began in March . At certain intervals Roman priests inserted an intercalary month , Mercedonius , after February to realign the year with the seasons.Historical names for February include the Anglo-Saxon terms Solmoneth ( mud month ) and Kale-monath ( named for cabbage ) as well as Charlemagne 's designation Hornung . In old Japanese calendar , the month is called Kisaragi ( 如月 , 絹更月 or 衣更月 ) . It is sometimes also called Mumetsuki ( 梅見月 ) or Konometsuki ( 木目月 ) . In Finnish , the month is called helmikuu , meaning `` month of the pearl '' .February is recognized as Black History Month in the United States and Canada . `` February '' is pronounced without the first r , as `` Febuary '' , by many speakers . This is probably elision , or an analogical change influenced by `` January '' .",0

"How many jumps are there in each set of volleyball match for each player ? At lower levels of play , e.g. , recreational leagues , the number of jumps varies by the player 's ability . The best players ( on recreational teams ) gets the lion-share of the sets , and thus , jumps a lot more than others . The ratio between best and worst players on the court could mean 25 jumps to zero . Additionally , the offense usually consists of `` high outside '' sets , with no `` quick attack '' in the middle , and thus , reduced the number of jumps required to block . However , at higher levels of play , the number of jumps varies by position more than ability . The least number of jumps go the outside hitters , both power and weak-side ( a/k/a , `` opposite '' ) . Their numbers are roughly inverses of each other , for obvious positional reasons . Figure 9-12 spike attempts for power hitters , and 4-7 blocks ; the opposite hitter gets the opposite numbers : 4-7 spike attempts , and 9-12 spikes . The lion-share of jumps go to the middle hitters , who ( usually ) jump on every volley , because they need to jump before the setter sets the ball . Additionally , they participate in every block . Figure they get about 12-25 spike jumps , and the same number of blocks . Hope this very un-scientific answer helps .",0

"can sata and pata raid work at the same time , so in `` my computer '' all the drives show up as a single space ? If you mean , can you combine both SATA and PATA drives in a single RAID , then the answer is yes , but not a hardware RAID.There are two kinds of RAID -- hardware and software . Hardware RAID is implemented by a hardware RAID controller , which is either part of your motherboard , or an add-in card . Software RAID is implemented by the operating system . Software RAID is slower than hardware RAID , but if you have a reasonably fast processor , it 's not using terribly much slower . If you have a slow processor , it will be slower , and more importantly , it will put a big load on your processor and make everything run slowly.To the best of my knowledge , there are no RAID controllers that will RAID an SATA drive with a PATA drive , but you can set up whatever RAID you want with software RAID . If you already have your drives in hardware RAID ( and intend to keep them that way ) then when you do this , you will be RAIDing the already-existing hardware RAIDs , since a hardware RAID is treated as a single drive on the `` software level '' .Here 's some info on software RAID in Windows : http : //www.techimo.com/articles/index.pl ? photo=149Here 's some info on software RAID in GNU/Linux : http : //www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.htmlHere 's some info on software RAID in Mac OS X : http : //www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/softraid3.htmlYou can find abundant info on doing software RAID on these and other operating systems by entering `` software RAID '' together with name of the operating system in a search engine .",0

"What is the speed of light in inches per second ? Hi Writholeen , the only flaw in JayNick 's answer is the accuracy part . As per the National Institute of Standards and Technology , the exact value of Speed of Light in vacuum is 299,792,458 m/s . By exact , I mean there is no uncertainity till the last digit . To be precise , what we usually call the `` speed of light '' is really the speed of light in a vacuum ( the absence of matter ) . In reality , the speed of light depends on the material that light moves through . Thus , for example , light moves slower in glass than in air , and in both cases the speed is less than in a vacuum . However , the density of matter between the stars is sufficiently low that the actual speed of light through most of interstellar space is essentially the speed it would have through a vacuum , so we do n't make much error by ignoring the difference.To make it easier for you to convert , here is the speed in alternative units : ( 1 ) 983,571,056.4304461 foot/second ( 2 ) 11,802,852,677.165352 inch/second ( 3 ) 1,079,252,848.8 kilometer/hour ( 4 ) 299,792.458 kilometer/second ( 5 ) 582,749,918.3585312 knot ( 6 ) 880,991.0899527 mach ( 7 ) 670,616,629.3843952 mile/hour ( mph ) These values are accurate to the 7th digit of decimal . Flaw in JayNick 's answer : The speed of light in kilometres per second is 279,600 kilometres/sec . Even if you approximate the actual value , 299,792.458 kilometer/second by round off the last three digit , the value would have been 300,000 kilometers per second .",0

"what is cancer ? Simple answer : A cell in the body that has gone out of control causing a disease.Cancer is a class of diseases characterized by uncontrolled division of cells and the ability of these cells to invade other tissues , either by direct growth into adjacent tissue ( invasion ) or by implantation into distant sites ( metastasis ) . This unregulated growth is caused by damage to DNA , resulting in mutations to genes that control cell division . Several mutations may be required to transform a normal cell into a malignant cell . These mutations are often caused by chemicals or physical agents called carcinogens . Some mutations occur spontaneously , or they can be inherited ( germ line mutations . ) Cancer can cause many different symptoms , depending on the site and character of the malignancy and whether there is metastasis . Cancer may be painless . A definitive diagnosis usually requires the histologic examination of tissue by a pathologist . This tissue is obtained by biopsy or surgery . Once diagnosed , cancer is usually treated with surgery , chemotherapy , or radiation.If untreated , cancers may eventually cause death . Cancer is mainly a disease of later years , and is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries . Most cancers can be treated and many cured , especially if treatment begins early . Many forms of cancer are associated with exposure to environmental factors , such as tobacco smoking , alcohol , and certain viruses . Some of these can be avoidable , and public health and vaccination programmes are important on a global scale.Another viewpoint : A general term for about 100 diseases characterized by uncontrolled , abnormal growth of cells . The resulting mass , or tumor , can invade and destroy surrounding normal tissues . Cancer cells from the tumor can spread through the blood or lymph ( the clear fluid that bathes body cells ) to start new cancers in other parts of the body ( metastases ) .",0

"How does the cold make you cough ? What 's the connection between bad weather and microbes inside us ? It 's simple . Our bodies system , especially the defense system , work best on a range of temperature . When the temperature outside ( that will affect the inside body temperature ) is changed , it changed the whole things that happened in our body , such as hormones , blood pressure , and especially , the lifosit ( the body 's defense `` army '' ) . Sure , if the lifosit ca n't work well , so does the entire body 's defense system . But why microbes still can live at its best ? Simple , because the microbes ' temperature tolerance is higher ( or `` cooler '' ) than our body.So in short , when our body is in cold , it 's just like a snow hurricane winter to our body 's defense system , but still a summer springtime for the microbes . When the microbes spread over the body , it then attacks the part of the body that it loves , such as the brain ( so that it makes you dizzy ) , the defense system ( and the body reacted with rising your body temperature to reactivate the lifosit ) , and the sponge organ within our neck ( that 's their fave place ) . That 's the reason why if you get cold , wearing a syal or drinking hot tea makes better .",0

"why are you a Christian ? honestly I was introduced to Christianity growing up , but that is n't why I 'm Christian . It is very obvious to me that someone had to create the world and universe . So many wonderful miraculous things happen to people that can not be explained by logic , or natural order . Even the complexity of natural order is too vast to be by impossible chance . This led me to know that there is a Supreme Being.As for why Christianity , there are a couple of reasons . The Bible has never been proven inacurate , which supports the fact that it is divinely inspired . Some good/interesting books about this topic are written by Lee Strobel `` The Case for Christ '' `` The Case for a Creator '' and a couple more . Even when the Bible has n't been believed , someone has come across ruins that disproves man 's theory , and inforces that the Bible is right . Creation interpretation of data makes sense to me , and having the world be ~6000 years old gets rid of lots of problems ( like there should be billions more people on the earth if it has been around for millions of years , the fact that trees that are buried in layers supposedly thousands of years apart should have rotted , not nearly enough fossils- let alone NONE that are inbetweens , etc ) . These are physical external reasons to me.There is also a much more important internal aspect to why I allow Christ to rule my life . Reading His Word , applying His principles ( which never contradict each other ) , and knowing that someone always loves me no matter how much I screw up has made a difference in my life . This change is so real that I can be certain of God , His Son , and the Holy Spirit . I now never have that 'does anybody care ? ' empty feeling , or the 'why am I even here/what is the point of existance ? ' attitude . This does not mean that I have the perfect life , and all is sunshine . I sometimes have down days , I still get frusterated at times and ask why , but there is always an instruction manual to go to , and He is always with me . That is a very comforting thought , that the God of the entire universe specifically loves me , cares about me , listens to me whenever I take the time to talk with Him , and can change my attitudes and bless me . How wonderful !",0

"what happen to a chicken egg in water vs a chicken egg in vinegar and why ? Several things can happen . Soaked in vinegar for several hours , the shell becomes pliable from decalcification , allowing you to insert it in a narrow necked bottle.When boiling eggs , adding vinegar to the water will coagulate ( denature ) the albumin if the eggshell cracks , preventing it from creating egg drop soup.And as vinegar has a higher density than watr , eggs will float more easily , expeially if the eggs are stale .",0

"How do i know if i have a hormone imbalance because of certain ... uh things ? in december of 2005 i didnt have my period all month , i talked to my firend but she said it would be a homrone imbalance , does it matter now that ive finally had my period ? It could be a hormonal imbalance , but it could be fine . Sometimes , when you are really stressed out or busy or not eating/sleeping/etc well enough , your ovulation will be delayed . So , try to think back to the time right after your last period ( before this one ) . If you were traveling a lot , or dealing with a lot of stressful stuff , maybe that 's the reason . I would say , just wait a few months and as long as you get back on a mostly normal schedule , do n't worry about it .",0

You can then refer back to this to always push your actions on a step at a time . Search for `` getting things done '' .",0

"Opinion of Marijuana v/s Alcoholic Beverages ? Should both be illegal or legal ? What are the differences to you ? Have you used both in your lifetime ? I find that alcohol seems to take whatever mood a person is in and magnify it ; so a person who is drinking in celebration becomes more exhuberant , the person who is drinking out of anger becomes more beligerant , and the person who is drinking out of depression sinks even lower . On the other hand , Marijuana typically mellows a person regardless of their mood going into it . It is common for people to become paranoid when using pot , especially with ongoing use . Both are used most often to relax and unwind ; but can become misused as a means to avoid problems . With both , the user builds a tolerance to the substance , so more and more is needed to have the desired effect with continued use . Both will alter the user 's perception and judgement.My opinion is that as long as cigarettes and alcohol are legal , there is no reason why marijuana should n't be -- it is no worse than either of those drugs . I do n't know from a medical/research standpoint , but it seems to me that alcohol is actually more harmful to the body than pot , and I believe that it is socially more harmful , because of the effects I 've observed that I noted above . If marjuana were legal , I would use it on a weekend night before watching a movie or something . In the past , I went through phases when I would smoke daily -- and it really saps motivation from a person . I used to drink , probably the most before I was of legal age . I got sick plenty of times . Now I do n't like the taste , and many alcoholic beverages actually give me a sinus/allergy attack . So it is rare for me to use either of these things now .",0

"Is the Brady Bill based on a Nazi Gun Control Law ? I was told it was the exact same - almost word for translated word . Ridiculous . Is the law requiring cars to stop at a stop sign based on a Nazi law ? Because the laws are remarkably similar to laws in Nazi Germany requiring cars to stop at stop signs . ( One group has claimed that the origin of the distinction between guns suitable for sporting use and other guns comes from Nazi Germany . And the group further claims that when the Brady Bill attempts to outlaw private ownership of semi-automatic weapons ( which are only good for killing large numbers of people quickly , in war or otherwise , or practising to do so ) it is applying this distinction first developed in Nazi law . But 1 ) that is a far cry from the Brady Bill being a `` translation '' of Nazi legislation , 2 ) the Brady Bill ban on selected semi-automatic weapons is not the same as a ban on private ownership of any weapon not suitable for sporting use , and 3 ) the concept of a ban on such weapons in private hands goes back way before the Nazis , and existed throughout Europe , back into the days of Kings and nobility . It was not invented by the Nazis.Oppose gun control if you like . But this is not a reason to do so .",0

"Which search engine is better and brighter ? My vote goes to Google.My answer is google for the following reasons : Pros of Google : As a seach engine , google has the best relevance and presents the results in a way that I find easy to decide what pages are best for me . Its the best in terms of researching information.For makin money , a # 1 on google is worth many times more than a # 1 on yahoo . Yahoo ! blocks the top of the SERPs with sponsored ads.Google also has a neat interface . Yahoo is not bad too , but its interface is not that neat . The reason for that being it to be a portal . I think a nice interface is very important since people will come back more often if so.The relevance of search results make its 'Feeling Lucky ' feature pretty useful . Firefox address bar by defaults goes to 1 site listed on your search results.Google has tried to stay away from Spam/ misleading sites better than other search engines.Cons of Google : However , few problems with google , its web crawler dose n't capture hyperlinks from PDF files stored on net , a feature which Yahoo provides.Also , Google at present does not provide an index for video aggregation through the web crawler , a feature which Altavista provided since 1999 . The problems include accuracy of the media file . That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.Due to a larger share of 'searching ' community , Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs . Because most bloggers mention the word failure with President Bush 's name , the # 1 site on searching Failure is the website of President Bush.Yahoo is doing pretty good research in Search Technologies , for example Grokker.http : //www.grokker.com/grokker.html ? query=Anirudh % 20Koul & Yahoo=true & Daypop=true & numResults=250",0

"Why do some states still have barbaric ways and have the death penilty and others do n't ? I notice that there is still legallized murder in some states and none in others . How can a civillized government allow this to happen in any states ? The short answer is that we live in a Democracy and death penalty laws are on the books because people ( or their representatives ) put them there . There are usually four distinct groups of people involved and it cuts across party lines . Large groups favor the death penalty and large groups oppose it for any number of good reasons . Small groups who have lost someone to murder believe that the death penalty is `` too good '' for the perpetrator , but are not allowed to take the law into their own hands . Small groups related to the murderer oppose the death penalty because of shame and the fact that they still love the perpetrator and find good excuses for him/her.On top of all that , sensational murders committed by those who expect to escape punishment spur on society to support the death penalty . Crimes against innocent children are particularly heinous . And news that someone convicted of murder has been proven ( by DNA tests ? ) to be innocent show the weaknesses in our judicial system.The question really is not all that simple . In New York state , the results of a close Governors race was likely determined on the death penalty issue . The winner favored the penalty while the incumbent never used it based on personal beliefs . Changing politics will always be involved . Many will always feel that a barbaric murderer should know that he/she might face a barbaric fate . And some feel that might save innocent lives .",0

"Why is the sky blue ? Light is a kind of energy that can travel through space . Light from the sun or a light bulb looks white , but it is really a mixture of many colors . The colors in white light are red , orange , yellow , green , blue and violet . You can see these colors when you look at a rainbow in the sky.Rainbow PictureThe sky is filled with air . Air is a mixture of tiny gas molecules and small bits of solid stuff , like dust.As sunlight goes through the air , it bumps into the molecules and dust . When light hits a gas molecule , it may bounce off in a different direction . Some colors of light , like red and orange , pass straight through the air . But most of the blue light bounces off in all directions . In this way , the blue light gets scattered all around the sky.When you look up , some of this blue light reaches your eyes from all over the sky . Since you see blue light from everywhere overhead , the sky looks blue .",0

Why not compair them to the KKK Christians or the Hitler Christians , or the wife and child beating Christians or the Mass murderer Christians who claimed that God and the Bible told them to murder . These people clearly Perverted the Christian religion to justify their own sickness . So why ca n't you understand that people do this with all religions.And why do Christians call everything a Muslim does Terrorism . I am sickened by true terrorism where innocent people are killed as we are taught if you kill one innocent person it is as if you have killed all of man kind . But I also believe people who are being attacked have the right to defend themselves . The way people act they would now define the US founding fathers were terrorists because they stood up against the English occupation .

"Why ca n't a praying mantis be enlarged 80 times its size and survive ? A giant mantis has two reasons not to survive.To sum the consequenses up , a giant prayer mantis has difficulty taking in oxygen ; can not fly ; and will collapse.The first , the oxygen thing . Just as the previous answer indicates , insects intake oxygen via diffusion.Picture a room with perfect still air , like a cellar . Suppose you put an open bottle of perfume at one end of the room . Some time later , you can smell the perfume at the other end of the room . There 's no air current in the room to bring the fragrant to you . It 's the perfume molecules , they wander around randomly . Some of them find their way into your nostrils so you can smell them . You will be able to smell the perfume sooner in a smaller room because the molecules have to wander through a shorter distance.The blood of insects does not carry oxygen , they have a series of air-filled tubes ( called trachea , plural tracheae ) all over their body , opening to some 'port-holes ' ( called spiracles ) along their abdomen . Most of insects are so small that the oxygen molecules , once entered the spiracles ( port-holes ) , do n't have long to wander along the tubes before reaching their destination -- the organs where they are consumed . Now , suppose the same insect is enlarged 80 times its length . The airway is also enlonged 80 times . It would take a LOT more time for oxygen to wander along this super long tube . During that time , the organs would have consumed all the oxygen around them without new oxygen coming in . So they die , and the insect dying with them.However this is only the case for small insects . Larger insects actually have air-bags withing their body to make a breeze along their tracheae ( air tubes ) to bring in oxygen . Quoting from the sourse page , `` Larger insects , such as grasshoppers and wasps , have internal air sacs connected to their tracheae . These insects speed up their gas exchange by squeezing the sacs to make them suck air in from outside . '' I 've no idea whether a prayer mantis has air sacs or not , but I 've seen one bigger than any grasshoppers or wasps I ever saw . Nevertheless , a giant prayer mantis would need much more powerful air sacs than the grasshoppers'.Now come to the second reason . Size . We will look at the two consequences of a super-huge size seperately.Think of a car on a highway . It can drive over 100 feet in a matter of seconds -- let 's say 2 seconds , so it 's speed is 50 feet per second . Now the car shrinks to the size of a prayer mantis . In the same 2 seconds , how far can it drive now ? 1 feet , more or less , so it 's speed is 0.5 feet per second . We see that the mini car is much slower . But the driver , who shrank with the car , he thinks he 's driving as fast ! Now think of the mantis , and think of a helicopter . The mantis flies much slower than the helicopter , just like the mini car is slower than the real car . And we have it that the faster things move through the air , the more resistance they experience . The helicopter flies fast , so its shape must be streamlined , as to reduce air resistance . The prayer mantis flies slow , so he does n't care much about air resistance , he can have any cool shape he desires . But for a giant mantis ? He would move much faster , and experience so much air resistance that with his cool shape ( not much streamlined ) he wo n't be able to fly at all.Let 's face the second consequence . Has anyone ever made a jelly block 5 feet long , 5 feet wide and 5 feet high ? What will happen if such a giant jelly is constructed ? It would collapse right away and flow like water . But any half-inch long , half-inch wide , half-inch high jelly block would stay all right in one 's spoon . What happens when the jelly grows in size ? For each bit of jelly in the bottom , there 's simply much more jelly on top of it ! And when that bit of jelly can no longer bear the burden , it breaks itself and flow away so that it wo n't have to support any more . So th",0

MistWing SilverTail adding water to potassium already causes it to explode . you are correct - the reaction releases hydrogen and forms an oxide of potassium , and the considerably exothermic nature of the reaction generates enough heat to ignite the hydrogen gas . so , mixing water and potassium solid typically causes a big-time explosion - just like mixing water and sodium.as for the powdered magnesium in there - i suspect that the explosion would scatter it , and it might ignite - the ignition temperature for magnesium metal is 450 C - so you 'd probably end up with white-hot burning magnesium shrapnel flying everywhere ! so , if you 're ever thinking about making a nasty bomb , sounds like a good way to do it .",0

Just from your question it does n't sound like you are on the level you need to be . However , do n't let me discourage you at all . Get your buddies together and try and film some of your skiing . Try to enter in half pipe , slopestyle , and big air contests . Or freeskiing contests if thats more your style . You need to get exposure . When you start winning the competitions you will get the sponsors . Also start talking to local shops . Local sponsors will open the doors to big name sponsors . Good luck .",0

"Why do Life Savers candy make blue sparks when you bite them ? It works the best with `` Wintogreen , '' rather than peppermint , and should be done with a fresh pack ( the moisture makes it spark better ) . The spark that comes from the Life Saver is considered as a type of triboluminescence , which the sugar in Life Savers contain . Here 's an excerpt from my source site : `` Wintergreen sparking , it 's believed , is actually a three-step process . Step One : When you shatter the sugar crystals with your teeth , electrons ( which are negatively charged ) break free . As a result , the atoms in which the electrons were formerly embedded become positively charged . In what amounts to a subatomic game of musical chairs , the free electrons dash around madly trying to find a new home . `` Step Two : Meanwhile , as the sugar crystals disintegrate , nitrogen molecules from the air attach themselves to the fractured surfaces . When the free electrons strike the nitrogen molecules , they cause the latter to emit invisible ultraviolet radiation , along with a faint visible glow . `` Step Three : The UV radiation is absorbed by the wintergreen flavoring , methyl salicylate . This then emits the fairly bright blue light you see . Pretty complicated , I admit . Clearly the planners in the Pentagon were n't the first to be obsessed with high-tech gimcracks . ''",0

The 45KVA is for 230 for 110 volts you would need half of the 45KVA or 22.5KVAAt least that is the way it calculated for me using those tools.So pretty much you need a generator that can deliver 150 amps .

"Are American Indians really sovereign , and should they be Americans ? If you call occupation of territory settled by people and taking their land while denying them their rights or even treating them as humans civilized I guess the US must be the most barbarious civilization there is . People have been condemning the Nazis for trying to wipe out the Jews , well the Americans have suceeded even more by almost wiping out an entire nation of cultured people who were long settled in the continent with their own culture , law and government . So yes technically American Indians or more precisely the various tribes are the first people here and thus should be sovereign and even ruling the white man not vice versa as it is . They have more right to be called Americans than the rat tag bunch of colonials that arrived here and started a wave of slaughter and massacres such as the force eviction of tribes along the trail of tears , force evacuation and settlement of reservations , gifts of smallpox infested blankets in an effort in biological warfare , broken treaties and senseless wars and killings . Think about that .",0
"What are the effects that ketosis has on the adult body ? A few yrs ago i began losing a substantial amount of weight , my drs did a battery of tests from diabetis to thyroid- they came up with ketosis saying that is what caused the weight loss and explains my neverending thirst and bouts with dehydration . I have researched and I still dont understand ketosis . Anyone else have this experience ? `` Ketosis , which is one of the body 's processes for the metabolism of body fat , should not be confused with ketoacidosis ( severe ketosis which causes the blood to become acidic ) , a medical condition induced by diabetes , that is usually accompanied by dehydration , hyperglycemia , and insulin deficiency . Since insulin is required to utilize glucose , lack of insulin causes an energy crisis and the body goes to extremes to produce more glucose and also provide ketones for energy . Glucose accumulates to the point that the kidney must use water to spill it into the urine , losing that water and causing dehydration in the process . The dehydration exacerbates the acidosis in a vicious cycle . Alcoholic ketoacidosis is also an energy crisis but of different origin . Because alcohol causes dehydration and blocks the first step of gluconeogenesis , the body is unable to synthesize enough glucose to meet its needs , thus the energy crisis begins.The breath of people in a ketagenic state commonly contains acetone , detectable as a sweet smell that may be mistaken for ethyl alcohol.Deliberately induced ketosis through a low-carbohydrate diet has been used to treat medical conditions . The ketogenic diet is an approach to treating epilepsy , and the Atkins Nutritional Approach is marketed for treating obesity . ''",0

"whats happens with egg pressure and how much can it take how do i messure it ? mike ? how do i messure egg pressure how can u make it so that u can make the question a science fair topic The pressure within a chicken egg may be rather nominal , because eggs breathe without lungs . Oxygen is free to diffuse through the shell . Water is nearly incompressible , the effect even seven miles down at the bottom of the sea is nil . Gas is highly compressible and you have to halve the volume to double the pressure at constant temperature , per the perfect gas laws.Most boiled eggs are not perfectly ovalic because there is an air space within the shell . That air space would resist any increase in `` hydraulic '' pressure and excess gas should diffuse out of the shell.Of course a spoiled egg may build up pressure due to rapid decomposition and an egg shell would be fairly strong to retain it . Never microwave eggs because they may build up steam pressure and make a real mess . Early microwave machines had perforated plastic doors rather than solid glass and I recall one unhappy fellow who received a polkadot egg spattered shirt . Good luck .",0

So what happens if you have one infinity , and remove bits of it to create another infinitity separated by a small space ? You 'd probably end up with two infinities , which means the concept has to be finite.So as an amount , its indefinite , but as a concept , especially as a singularity in math , has a definite meaning ( measurement was too confusing ) .For example , in trigonometry tan 90° = ∞ , and arctan ∞ = +/- 90° .

"What exactly is antimatter ? Howmuch of it has been produced till today ? Antimatter or contra-terrene matter is matter that is composed of the antiparticles of those that constitute normal matter . If a particle and its antiparticle come in contact with each other , the two annihilate and produce a burst of energy , which results in the production of other particles and antiparticles or electromagnetic radiation . In these reactions , rest mass is not conserved , although ( as in any other reaction ) energy ( E=mc² ) is conserved.Scientists in 1995 succeeded in producing antiatoms of hydrogen , and also antideuteron nuclei , made out of an antiproton and an antineutron , but no antiatom more complex than antideuterium has been created yet . In principle , antiatoms of any element could be built from readily available sources of antiparticles . Such antiatoms would have exactly the same properties as their normal-matter counterparts . The production of antielements in bulk quantities seems unlikely to ever become achievable , however.Positrons and antiprotons can individually be stored in a device called a Penning trap , which uses a combination of magnetic field and electric fields to hold charged particles in a vacuum . Two international collaborations , ATRAP and ATHENA , used these devices to store thousands of slowly moving antihydrogen atoms in 2002 . It is the goal of these collaborations to probe the energy level structure of antihydrogen to compare it with that of hydrogen as a test of the CPT theorem . One way to do this is to confine the antiatoms in an inhomogenous magnetic field ( one can not use electric fields since the antiatoms are neutral ) and interrogate them with lasers . If the anti-atoms have too much kinetic energy they will be able to escape the magnetic trap , and it is therefore essential that the anti-atoms be produced with as little energy as possible . This is the key difference between the antihydrogen that ATRAP and ATHENA produced , which was made at very low temperatures , and the antihydrogen produced in 1995 which was moving at a speed close to the speed of light.Antimatter/matter reactions have practical applications in medical imaging , such as positron emission tomography ( PET ) . In some kinds of beta decay , a nuclide loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron ( in the same event , a proton becomes a neutron , and neutrinos are also given off ) . Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a cyclotron and are widely generated for medical use.Antiparticles are created everywhere in the universe where high-energy particle collisions take place , such as in the center of our galaxy , but none has been detected that is residual from the Big Bang , as most normal matter is . [ 1 ] The unequal distribution between matter and antimatter in the universe has long been a mystery . The solution likely lies in the violation of CP-symmetry by the laws of nature ; see baryogenesis.how much produced it is on and on and on",0

"can someone explain the cell cycle to me in english please ... . ? my bio teacher makes no sense at alll ... . The cell cycle , or cell division cycle , is the cycle of events in a eukaryotic cell from one cell division to the next . It consists of interphase , mitosis , and usually cell division . The cell cycle is regulated by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases . Leland H. Hartwell , R. Timothy Hunt , and Paul M. Nurse won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of these central molecules in the regulation of the cell cycle.The phases of the cell cycle are : The G0 phase is a period in the cell cycle where cells exist in a quiescent state . The G1 phase is the first growth phase . S phase , during which the DNA is replicated , where S stands for the Synthesis of DNA . G2 phase is the second growth phase , also the preparation phase for the cell . M phase or mitosis and cytokinesis , the actual division of the cell into two daughter cells . A surveillance system , so-called `` checkpoints '' , monitor the cell for DNA damage and failure to perform critical processes . Checkpoints can block progression through the phases of the cell cycle if certain conditions are not met . For instance , there is a checkpoint which monitors DNA replication and keeps cells from proceeding to mitosis before DNA replication is completed . Similarly , the spindle checkpoint blocks the transition from metaphase to anaphase within mitosis if not all chromosomes are attached to the mitotic spindle.If this system senses a problem , a network of signaling molecules instructs the cell to stop dividing . They can let the cell know whether to repair the damage or initiate programmed cell death , a form of which is called apoptosis . Programmed cell death ensures that the damaged cell is not further propagated . For example , a certain protein , called p53 , acts to accept signals provoked by DNA damage . It responds by stimulating the production of inhibitory proteins that then halt the DNA replication process . Without proper p53 function , DNA damage can accumulate unchecked . A direct consequence is that the damaged gene progresses into a cancerous state . Today , defects in p53 are associated with a variety of cancers , including some breast and colon cancers.Some cells , such as neurons , never divide once they become locked in a G0 phase . However , recent data has shown that neurons undergoing cell death re-enter the cell cycle . Addition of cell cycle inhibitors prevent this type cell death called apoptosis .",0

"what is the function of stipules ? wha is the importance of stipules ? There are a number of interesting functions demonstrated for stipules of certain plant species.Also protection of emerging leaves . 1 . Stipules that are green may be leaf-like ( Examples : flowering quince , a geranium , and a sycamore ) , linear , thread-like , or reduced to minute scales , thereby requiring a hand lens to see . Plant biologists have assumed that green stipules are photosynthetic , but ecophysiologists generally have not determined how significant green stipules may be as temporary or persistent photosynthetic structures . Anatomical reports on photosynthetic stipules are exceedingly rare , so that we know little about the presence of stomates and the nature of the mesophyll in stipules . 2 . If hardened with lignin , a stipule may become modified as a spine , i.e. , a stipular spine . In many species , one stipular spine or a pair of stipular spines may be observed at each node , e.g. , among legumes , and for legumes , the stipular spine is the typical type of shoot armature ( Examples : coral tree , Chloroleucon , and a mimosa ) . Obviously , stipular spines were effective in their specific native habitat for many of these cases as an adaptation to reduce predation by vertebrate herbivores . Very large , hollow stipular spines in certain species of bull acacia ( Acacia , Family Mimosaceae ) serve as homes for ants , which defend the plant from all other herbivores . Stipular spines are extremely important forms of shoot armature for the succulent euphorbs ( Family Euphorbiaceae ; examples : crown-of-thorns , young stipular spines , and old stipular spines ) , most species of which occur in thorny scrub and woodland as well as desert habitats in Africa and southern Asia . Stipular spines also are present on certain climbers . 3 . In many groups of plants , stipules are short-lived , nonphotosynthetic structures that abscise before the leaf is fully expanded ( a legume ) . Such stipules tend to be nongreen , often hyaline ( an elm ) , off-white ( ramie ) , yellow , or brownish , but there are some remarkable cases where the stipule is brilliantly colored , especially with anthocyanins , red to purple vacuolar pigments ( Talauma hodgsonii ) . A nongreen stipule probably can be regarded as vestigial , lacking any function for the mature leaf and shoot but perhaps protecting the young leaf while it is at the growing tip . 4 . Sometimes stipules and stipels have evolved as extrafloral nectaries , utilized to nourish mutualistic ants , or other types of glands . 5 . In Smilax , a lianaceous monocotyledon , the stipule may develop as a tendril . 6 . For whatever function , corky stipules are known from certain dryland shrubs , for example , the species of creosote bush ( Larrea young stipules of L. tridentata and older stipules in L. nitida ) in New World deserts and the tough-leaved evergreen species of Ceanothus in California chaparral .",0

"did rachel carson work with animals ? if so what kind ? NAME : Rachel Carson BIRTHDATE : May 27 , 1907 BIRTHPLACE : Springdale , PA EDUCATION : 1925- entered Pennsylvania College for Women ( now Chatham College ) 1929- graduated with honors , earning a scholarship to continue her studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , MD . 1932- M.A . in Zoology from John Hopkins University . FAMILY BACKGROUND : The youngest of three children , Rachel Carson had a rugged upbringing in a simple farmhouse outside the western Pennsylvania river town of Springdale . She credited her mother with introducing her to the world of nature that became her lifelong passion . DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS : After completing her education , Carson joined the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries as the writer of a radio show entitled `` Romance Under the Waters , '' in which she was able to explore life under the seas and bring it to listeners . In 1936 , after being the first woman to take and pass the civil service test , the Bureau of Fisheries hired her as a full-time junior biologist , and over the next 15 years , she rose in the ranks until she was the chief editor of all publications for the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service . During the 1940s , Carson began to write books on her observations of life under the sea , a world as yet unknown to the majority of people . She resigned from her government position in 1952 in order to devote all her time to writing . The idea for her most famous book , Silent Spring , emerged , and she began writing it in 1957 . It was published in 1962 , and influenced President Kennedy , who had read it , to call for testing of the chemicals mentioned in the book . Carson has been called the mother of the modern environmental movement .

"How should one go about cleaning the anus after heavy anal intercourse ? Creams ? ... Gels ? ... ..Toilet paper with no salve ? The best way to clean after intercourse is..Females : after sex go and try to urinate ( pee ) , with this you will eliminate many of the bacteria that are on your urethra ( tube that evacuates urine from the bladder ) that can cause infections , and then take a shower.Males : take a nice hot shower and also trying to urinate might help to prevent infections .",0

"Has anyone done a study of the relationship between a woman 's mental health and the number of sex parteners ? The world encourages women these days to be more promiscuous than ever . Is there a price to be paid for this trend ? Has anyone done a study analyzing mental health in reference to the number of sexual partners a woman has ? Um , i strongly disagree with the person above me . But , the thing is , i too have not heard of a specific study done to analyze the mental health of women in relation to the number of sexual partners she has had . However , what i do know from speakers in various organizations , tell me that there is a real link to guilt and depression with the number of sex partners she has had in her life . Guilt when her husband knows that she has given away the gift reserved for husbands . ALthough her husband might not feel it 's a big deal , and has told her that , she still feels insecure . Depression may not be a direct cause of the number of sex partners , but it sure is related . Because when women have more sex partners , she increases her risk of becoming pregnant and contracting an STD with each partner she has . So , in the likelihood that she has become pregnant , she would most probably go for an abortion . And after the first abortion , she would be more likely to have more than one abortion . Increased abortions and HPV lead to cervical cancer and no children . And that leads to depression . It 's a sad state of affairs , but that is why more women are finding it hard to conceive and gets depressed because of it .",0

"what are everyday uses for calculus ? thanks ? Anytime you have a problem that is continuous , as opposed to discrete , you will need to use either integration or differentiation to characterize the solution . That means to say that every problem that involves time in one way or another will necessitate the use of calculus to find an answer at some instant in time . If the problem is such that you can approximate the answer , then you can discretize the parameters as small slices of time and come up with an approximate answer - without using calculus .",0
"what is the main ingredient in cocaine , where does it come from and what are the side efects of this drug ? it is extracted from the coca plant in south america , BUT there are so many other things that are in most batches of cocaine ( meaning cocaine is `` cut with '' other products ) such as analgesic drugs or even things like vitamin c or talcom powder , and most street coke is only around 40 % pure cocaine ... so its hard to say what the main ingredient is.the side effects depend on the frequency of use , how long you have been using , and how much you blow . an occaisonal user will probably experience little to no side effects , while a moderate user ( once or twice a week ) may begin to experince a `` drained '' feeling somewhere around 30-60 minutes after use , or a slight increase in irritability or other such things . a heavy user ( every day , multiple times a day ) will experience a pretty harsh come-down where one would feel exhausted , depressed , and like there is no point to doing anything because everything feels so BLAH and the only important or fun thing is drugs . they start to have mood swings , become irritated easily , paranoid , insomnia sets in which causes one to do more and more coke throughout the day to stay awake and live . it effects your life and your friends and at some point its hard to function in a normal day . pretty soon you NEED it , coke is all you think about . you think about when you can do it next , how much you have left , and where you can get it when you run out ... .i think that is probably all i can say at this point .",0

"Is LeBron James the next Michael Jordan ? Both number 23 ... Well , the thing that made Jordan great was not his skills . Yes he was a great player ( possibly one of the top two along with Wilt Chamberlain ) , he was a complete player . He could do everything excellently . He scored 30 points per game , grabbed over 5 boards , 3-4 assits , 2-3 steals , and even one season averaged a block per game . He was an all-around excellent player . There are other players even in his era who had just as many skills and were just as talented with natural ability . Scottie Pippen I think had more natural potential as was more graceful . Certainly Dominique Wlikens was more powerful.The thing that made Jordan great was his intelligence and his primacy ; his ability to get up for a game and take it to the next level . He thrived on pressure . He could get into another players head and totally shut them down from the inside out . When the game was on the line he took the game to another emotional level that had so much stress and pressure to it that every other opposing player was crushed by it and all his teammates fed off of it . Jordan 's natural talent was limited . He was n't even picked for his high school team the first time around . Lebron only went to high school . He is not mentally the same player as Jordan , and he never will be .",0

"How can we show the world that President Bush does'nt represent the american people. ?

But I worry about what people in other countries think about Americans when he speaks for us with that dumb redneck voice . He was not elected by the majority of Americans . We chose Al Gore . The supreme court appointed him president . In the 2004 election he did'nt win any primary elections . The repulicans did'nt let anyone challenge him . They made believe they were democrats and voted for Kerry , and the democrats were saddled with an unelectable candidate . Then they put a gay marrige thing on the ballot so people would go to the polls to vote against that , and voted for the more anti gay candidate while they were there . In the 2000 election Gore won the popular vote , i.e . the majority voted for gore . In other countries you win if the majority votes for you . The foreigners dont believe that story about how Bush won because he got more of something called an electoral vote , especially since it happened in a state run by his brother . The election in Florida was done by computer , and everyone knows that a really good hacker can get into a computer and make it malfunction , so you know when theres something fishy going on with a computer , a hacker has made it past the firewall . Streamcat did'nt say concentration camp , he said temporary concentration camp , its a metaphor .

"why do people generally get discusted with gay men but excited w/ the thought of two women ? About half of the guys I know are homophobic . One of my homophobic friends would say stuff like , “ I don ’ t have a problem with gay guys . I just don ’ t want them … around me , ” and “ Gay guys just wan na plunder my a*s. ” It ’ s so common for hetero guys to think that all gay guys wan na do is rape hetero guys . By definition , a phobia is an irrational fear . What ’ s to be afraid of ? Their scathing humor aside , homosexual men are the most harmless things on Earth . Have you ever heard of a gay murderer ? Or a gay thief ? Maybe I haven ’ t been around long enough , but I ’ ve never heard of a criminally deviant homo dude ( although I do know some pretty ghetto dyke hooligans ) . My point is I think most homophobic guys can ’ t explain why they ’ re scared of gay guys.What I think the reason is : The penis is the intrusive genital . Men brandish their penii with a subconscious feeling of superiority over women . And the idea that a man will use that power against his own kind repulses hetero men . Hetero guys like an*l sex ( with a female ) , not because it feels better , but because it shows ownership of the woman he ’ s sodomizing . The notion that they may be owned in the same way scares them.This is not necessarily fact . Just my take on the matter . Hey , I ’ m not man-hating . I ’ m just homo-defending.Guys , you should take it up the a*s every once in a while . Your g-spot is located next to your prostate , accessible only through the butth*le . I ’ m not suggesting having your butt plugged by another guy . If you ’ re not down for that , let your girlfriend hit it with a d*ldo . Don ’ t knock it ‘ til you try it .

Use one of the freeware internet programs to monitor your computer 's temperature . If all appears normal there , it might be another virus ( check for abnormal processes or cpu usage at your process manager ) or a recently installed DDR chip that does not quite agree with your computer or a software installation that did not complete quite succesfully .

'' Or , if someone says , `` Hey , is there something going on between you and Roger ? '' say `` we 've been dating for six months , actually .

We want to make sure everyone 's still comfortable . '' And then continue to act that way.The reason I say not to make an official announcement is that that is the most surefire way to get everyone gossipping ( even if you do n't think they will ! ) , and looking out for drama . Rather , if you just reveal quietly when asked , it 'll seem like `` no big deal , '' or , people will realize that you 've been acting so professionally , that 's why they 're surprised !

"Why do prisoners get to `` plea bargain '' for the crimes they chose to commit ? The way I see it , a woman does not get to say , `` Look , I really do not want to be raped , so can you just fondle me ? '' The clerk at the grocery store who is being robbed does n't get to say , `` I do n't feel like getting a serious injury or dying right now , so instead of shooting me in the chest or head , can you just shoot me in the leg ? `` So why do the criminals get to `` bargain '' and get to have the charges for the crime they committed made to be less than what they actually did ? It 's a very provocative question with a very mundane answer . I do n't think it 's fair either , but prosecutors sometimes need information about someone further up the line . If a rapist , for instance , also works with and has knowledge of a white slavery ring and can give credible testimony that will put the leaders and their underlings in jail a prosecutor may offer a lighter sentence in order to stop a larger criminal enterprise.The other reasons are more disturbing . Sometimes a prosecutor 's office is so overloaded that accepting a plea bargain is a way to make a dent in the case load that the office is carrying . Ideally , that would only occur with non-violent , first time offenders , but sadly that is not always the case.Finally , some victims are reluctant to testify or are so traumatized by the crime committed against them that they are unable to testify well and the D.A . 's office does n't want to risk an acquital . In this same vein are cases that can mount a credible reasonable doubt defense and cases where the evidence is weak or tainted.It a'int perfect , but its a better system than most others .",0

Some people are comfortable greeting others with a kiss , and a hug . while others are only comfortable with a polite handshake.Each couple has to establish boundries . It reminds me of an event about 4 years ago when a married couple went to a Lions Football game . they stayed at the same hotel as the visiting team . while down in the lounge one of the ( PRO ) athelets was trying to pick up the wife right in front of the hubby . the wife was all game for sex with a star and hubby was not happy . Her answer was this is a once in a life time event . if you ruin it for me I 'll make you regret it for the rest of your life . and he responded by saying `` if I let you then I 'll still regret be the one regretting it for the rest of my life and so will you '' He then asked her what 's more important to her sleeping with a star or being married to me ? Her responce was to turn and leave with the pro and , off they went . Hubby in a fit of anger went back to the room packed all his clothers and hers and checked out . and drove home . On the way he contacted his atty . and filed for divorce . as well as canceled all the credit cards , and placed a stolen report on the checking account . Wifey several hours later after her little adventure with the ( pro ) was trying to get back into the room . and could not figure out why the card did not work . She contacted the front desk only to learn the hubby had left . She went crying back to the ( pro ) , and he laughed and asked her what did she expect no `` man '' worth his salt would want any thing to do with a `` slut '' once he is done with her . well after getting pissed , and the hollering and screaming between the lovers . the ( pro ) had her tossed out of the hotel for stalking . Now crying , and feeling miserable she tried repeatedly to call her hubby , and only got the Answering machine . she tried to use the credit cards and learned they did not work . Now thourly pissed in her own right she calls hubby back and rips him up one side and down the other and called him every name in the book , but eventually she found a ride home . only to learn all the locks on the house had been changes . He left a note on the door for her along with some cash telling her to go back to her hotel maybe she could sleep her way into another man 's life . Needless to say they ended up divorced , and she was left holding the bag as he got custody , and did not have to pay Alimony . So basically each person has to weigh the options in the relationship .

"what do these college sports phrases mean ? 1 ) true freshman 2 ) fifth year senior 3 ) walk on 4 ) red shirt . Thanks The NCAA rules allow a player 5 years to complete his/her 4 years of eligibility.A true freshman is someone playing during the first year of eligibility.A fifth year senior is someone who sat out a year ( see red shirt ) and is completing the 4th year of eligibility during his/her 5th year in school.A walkon is someone who was not recruted and given a scholarship . The athlete just showed up , tried out , and was good enough to stay on the team.A red shirt is an athlete who is passing up a year of play to extend eligibility . Red shirted players are allowed to practice with the team but not take part in competition.Originally , red shirting was allowed if an athlete was injured severly enough to end his season . The team could petition the NCAA for an extra year of eligibilty , and the player was red shirted for the remainder of the year.The name comes from the practice of having injured football players wear a red practice jersey to protect him during practice . Today redshirting may be done to allow a player to gain an extra year of experience before playing in `` The Big Time '' . It also may be done as a personel management tool . If a coach has two equally good players competing for one position as quarterback , one may be redshirted . That way his eligability is n't used up sitting on the bench .",0

"where natural digits 0123456789 are coming from ? In mathematics , a natural number is either a positive integer ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... ) or a non-negative integer ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... ) . The former definition is generally used in number theory , while the latter is preferred in set theory and computer science.Natural numbers have two main purposes : they can be used for counting ( `` there are 3 apples on the table '' ) , and they can be used for ordering ( `` this is the 3rd largest city in the country '' ) . The natural numbers developed with some difficulty . The Peano postulates state conditions that any successful definition must satisfy . Certain constructions show that , given set theory , models of the Peano postulates must exist.Peano axiomsThere is a natural number 0 . Every natural number a has a natural number successor , denoted by S ( a ) . There is no natural number whose successor is 0 . Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors : if a ≠ b , then S ( a ) ≠ S ( b ) . If a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every natural number which possesses it , then it is possessed by all natural numbers . ( This postulate ensures that the proof technique of mathematical induction is valid . )",0

"why do farts smell ? So why do farts smell ? Fermented food produces different types of fumes , some of which smell . Flatulence contains odorless gases , such as nitrogen , carbon dioxide , oxygen , and methane , but it also contains the `` oh-so-nasty '' hydrogen sulfide , which causes the smell . If you have not noticed by now , some of the aforementioned fumes are flammable , like methane and oxygen , so you can , in fact , burn farts . Yes , you can set them aflame ; it is not a myth.How much odor is produced also depends on the food you eat . Vegetarians might fart as often as meat-eaters , but their farts do not smell as much because vegetables produce less hydrogen sulfide . The more sulfur rich the foods you eat , the more your farts will stink because bacteria will generate sulfides and mercaptans as they break down the nutrients . Beware : even though cauliflower is a vegetable , it also makes you stinky , so watch out !",0

"what is a brake lining ? Brake linings are composed of a relatively soft but tough and heat-resistant material with a high coefficient of dynamic friction ( and ideally an identical coefficient of static friction ) typically mounted to a solid metal backing using high-temperature adhesives or rivets . The complete assembly ( including lining and backing ) is then often called a brake pad or brake shoe . In this view of an automobile disc brake , the brake pad is the black material held by the red metal component ( the brake caliper ) . The brake lining is that part of the brake pad which actually contacts the metal rotor when the brake is engaged.Using a typical bicycle brake as an example , the backing would be the metal shell which provides mechanical support , and the lining would be the rubbery portion which contacts the rims when the brakes are applied . In most modern vehicular applications the system is conceptually identical , except the rims would be replaced with solid steel ( or sometimes exotic metal ) rotors . Furthermore , a metal tang is usually incorporated into the pad assembly . The tang contacts the rotors when the linings are worn out , causing an annoying noise designed to alert the motorist that brake servicing is required.Since the lining is the portion of the braking system which converts the vehicle 's kinetic energy into heat , the lining must be capable of surviving high temperatures without excessive wear ( leading to frequent replacement ) or outgassing ( which causes brake fade , a decrease in the stopping power of the brake ) . Due to its suitability , asbestos is often a component in brake linings ; as a result , brake dust should never be inhaled",0
"Is it official Roman Catholic doctrine that unbaptized babies do not enter Heaven ? What is the belief re : the fate of non-believers ? Children who have died without Baptism , can only be entrusted to the mercy of God . Indeed , the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved , and Jesus ' tenderness toward children which caused him to say : `` Let the children come to me , do not hinder them , '' allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without Baptism . All the more urgent is the Church 's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism . a baby is a person created by God and a baby who 's died did have a soul . God , if He is truly the God of love every Christian believes he is , would never forsake one who can not argue for themselves . St. Therese once said `` Knowing the loving God that I know , I believe hell is empty '' By the way , what I 've mentioned above is actually Catholic Doctrine . Whatever people may say about limbo is the doctrine stretched to extremes , usually catechists who 're not sure about things just exaggerate ...

"What exactly constitutes an assist in NBA basketball ? When a player passes the ball , is it time ? Steps ? What exactly constitutes an assist ? I could n't find it in the rule book . In basketball , an assist is attributed to a player who passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads to a score , meaning that he or she was `` assisting '' in the basket . According to the Official 2004 NCAA Basketball Statistics Rules , an assist has to be `` a major part of the play , '' which either finds the player already with a `` positional advantage '' , or helps him or her get one . There is thus some judgement involved in deciding whether a player deserves an assist .",0

"How can I get back together with my ex-wife ? Our split up was due to a really bad situation . No adultery involved . However the tust was shattered ! Not knowing the details , it is tough to answer , but there are various types of women out there , and for some , trust is everything . If you did enough to make her leave you , it must have been pretty bad . I would assume ( since I do n't know the circumstances ) that either there have always been trust issues , or that your infidelity ( of whichever type ) was long standing and ongoing , and so she felt betrayed . In both cases , I do n't know if there is anything you could do . If she left because of pure emotional reaction , you might have a chance , but if it was an intellectual decision , it is not likely to work . Emotion can be reasoned with - an overreaction can be dealt with , but logic is usually rock solid . You could offer therapy for you both , however if you are already 'divorced ' , it seems a little too final to try that . Apologies alone wo n't really get you anywhere . Not much of an answer , but without any details , it 's the best I 've got . My main advice though is to know when to give up . Some battles ca n't be won . At some point , you might have to just count your losses , consider this an expensive learning experience , and do n't make the same mistake next time .",0

"Is there a recursive algorithm that generates all the permutations of a given string ? Here 's a java solution that uses recursion . The permute function takes two arguments : a done portion and a todo portion . The basic idea is that each of the characters in the todo portion could be the next character . So , at each step , n recursive calls are made , where n is the length of todo . Each call chooses a different character as the next character to go into the done portion . So , the first time the number of recursive calls will equal the number of characters in the initial string . Each of these calls will make further recursive calls equal to the number of characters in the initial string minus one . And so on . Thus , the number of solutions will be n ! = n*n-1*n-2* ... *1 , where n is the number of characters in the initial string.The program below was tested with java 's sun compiler 1.4.2.public class perm { public perm ( String S ) { permute ( `` '' , S ) ; } public void permute ( String done , String todo ) { if ( ( todo.length ( ) ==0 ) || ( todo.equals ( `` '' ) ) ) System.out.println ( done ) ; else { for ( int i=0 ; i < todo.length ( ) ; i++ ) { String c = todo.substring ( 0,1 ) ; todo = todo.substring ( 1 ) ; permute ( done+c , todo ) ; todo = todo + c ; } } } public static void main ( String args [ ] ) { if ( ( args.length==0 ) || ( args [ 0 ] .length ( ) ==0 ) || ( args [ 0 ] .equals ( `` '' ) ) ) return ; perm p = new perm ( args [ 0 ] ) ; } }",0

"Why Were The Days of the Week Named After The Solar System ? I was just curious . I know that Sunday is named after the Sun . Monday=Moon , Tuesday=Mars , Wed.=Mercury , Thur.=Jupiter , Friday=Venus , & Sat.=Saturn ... But why exactly ? . Was it believed that those days revolved around each of those planets at that time ? or what ? Thanks . A long time ago in human history , people thought that Earth was flat , and at the universe 's center . They believed that seven members of the solar system forever circled around us—see graphic to the right , or view one from Censorinus - Sur le jour natal . Some Mediterranian peoples also believed that each hour of the day was ruled by either the Sun , Moon or one of five then-known planets , all of which were thought of as gods . The sequence in which they thought hours were governed was the inverse order of distance they believed those solar system objects to be from Earth . During this time , Egyptians thought that the most distant was Saturn , shown at the bottom of the graphic above . They thought that the order of closer members ( shown counterclockwise following Saturn ) was Jupiter , Mars , Sun , Venus , Mercury and closest , the Moon . So they believed that the first hour was ruled by Saturn , the second by Jupiter and so on . Egyptians also believed that after each seven hours the order in which these objects ruled was repeated , so it started again with Saturn . According to those ancient Egyptians , the planet that ruled the first hour also governed the entire twenty-four hour period , and gave its name to that day . The first ( and also the 8th , 15th and 22nd ) hours of the first day were sacred to Saturn , the 23rd to Jupiter , the 24th to Mars and the first hour of the next day to the Sun . Therefore , they believed that the first day was ruled by and named after Saturn ( Saturday ) and the second was ruled by ( and named after ) the Sun ( Sunday ) . Egyptians once divided all twelve 30-day months ( of their 360-day calendar year ) into three 10-day weeks in the same manner as Greeks of the same period . The epoch at which planet worship caused them to change its length to seven days is not known , but it must have been over twenty-five hundred years ago because Herodotus , writing in his History during the 5th century B.C . said : `` Here are some other discoveries of the Egyptians . They find ... each day belongs to a god ... '' Adherents of the cult of Sin at Harran , who were known as Harranians or Sabeans by Arabic and Syrian authors , named their days after the same solar system members as Egyptians and Persians . Like Hebrews and many other peoples , they considered the one named after Saturn to be the seventh day , so they began their week with a day named after the Sun . All seven days were named after solar system members in the same order as they were in Egypt . It is interesting to note that these exact same solar system objects , and in the same sequence , were also used to name days in ancient India , Tibet and Burma . This is also true of names for Japanese days of the week , but the custom there has been traced back only a thousand years . Roman soldiers stationed in Egypt became accustomed to the pagan seven-day week and began to introduce it into their own homeland to replace their eight-day marketing week . Octavian ( Caesar Augustus ) and succeeding Roman rulers permitted this practice but it was n't made official until the emperor Constantine took that step in A.D. 321 . English names for days of the week are derived from Anglo-Saxon names for those same seven heavenly bodies that were revered by ancient peoples . Compare those English and Anglo-Saxon day names in the table below . Other similarities between day and `` planet '' names in various countries can be observed there .",0

"is yahoo better or google ? My answer is google for the following reasons : Pros of Google : As a seach engine , google has the best relevance and presents the results in a way that I find easy to decide what pages are best for me . Its the best in terms of researching information.For makin money , a # 1 on google is worth many times more than a # 1 on yahoo . Yahoo ! blocks the top of the SERPs with sponsored ads.Google also has a neat interface . Yahoo is not bad too , but its interface is not that neat . The reason for that being it to be a portal . I think a nice interface is very important since people will come back more often if so.The relevance of search results make its 'Feeling Lucky ' feature pretty useful . Firefox address bar by defaults goes to 1 site listed on your search results.Google has tried to stay away from Spam/ misleading sites better than other search engines.Cons of Google : However , few problems with google , its web crawler dose n't capture hyperlinks from PDF files stored on net , a feature which Yahoo provides.Also , Google at present does not provide an index for video aggregation through the web crawler , a feature which Altavista provided since 1999 . The problems include accuracy of the media file . That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.Due to a larger share of 'searching ' community , Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs .

He is suggesting that he would like to do take this job as he is keen to get back into training horses which is what he has done before.2 . Yes . He is saying that he would be willing to accept less money than normal to do the job.3 . Beat a dead horse ( actually the real expression is - Flog a dead horse ) is an expression which means to do something which has no point because it is already settled . For example , if a child asked his mother for something and she said NO and would not change her mind , then to keep asking can be described as - Beating ( Flogging ) a dead horse . In your example it possibly is referring to the pointlessness of asking for work when none is on offer . But it is also meant to be funny in this case because the subject is actually about horses : - ) The expression probably comes from the pointlessness of beating a horse ( to make it work harder ) if it is dead ! !",0

"Is it better to rent , own or build a home in California these days ? Seems that renting is cheaper and you could save money . But at the same time , money depreciate , so may be it is better to invest ? So , if not renting , then build or buy ? And with the prediction of high interest rate and the buble burst , it is very difficult to make a decision . California is among the most overheated markets in real estate so buying now MAY get you into a financial mess by overpaying . Renting is always a waste of money .

"Although we see with two eyes a given object we see only one image.Why not two ? Although we see with two eyes , each of which creates its own , slightly different image , we normally have single vision , meaning we see only one image of an object . This is because your brain can normally control the muscles that move each eye carefully so that both are pointing accurately at the object you are looking at . When each eye produces its own image , your brain then joins them together into one . This gives us what is called ‘ single binocular vision ’ .Double vision can be an effect that you can create yourself . For example , if you hold your finger in front of your eyes and then look past it into the distance , you will experience double vision . This is normal .",0

"What is better NonCommissioned Officers or Commissioned Officers ? ( follow-up question.. ) It all depends on what you mean by `` better . '' The officer corps are the managers of the military and are granted that rank by the President ( at least indirectly ) . Usually they are better educated , normally requiring a college degree . Have completed some sort of military training such as Officer Candidate School , the Military Academy or ROTC . This is followed by several months , typically , of training in their branch of service . The pay for officers and the breadth of their responsibilities are normally greater than those of NCOs.If the officers are the brains of the military , NCOs are the backbone . They are more specialized in their jobs and typically have less overall responsibility . However , they have worked up through the ranks and know how things work . For this reason , they supervise soldiers on a day-to-day basis to ensure objectives of 'management ' are met . They will typically have more experience than the newly commissioned lieutenant and the wise officer will solicit their input . Personally , I had more fun and a lot less politics as an NCO.Another category , between NCO and Officer , is Warrant Officer . This is a highly specialized individual normally with expert technical skills but lacking a normal commission . Examples may include some pilots . I have n't been one of these , but that seems the way to go ; - )",0

"How do you play tennis ? First , you get a partner and get on a tennis court . Then , at the start of the game , choose who will serve first.EX : You serve 1st . Start behind the bottom line of the court on you side . Hit the ball into the opposite square on your opponent 's side of the court . Make sure you do n't pass the little white line in the center . If you do n't in the first try , that is a fault . If the ball hits the top of the net and goes over to the other side , that is a let . Redo . No faults , no points . You get a second try . Try to hit the opposite square on your opponents side of the court . If you miss again , that is a double fault and your opponent gets a point . The score would say 0-15 . ( server 's score is always first ) Now , you switch sides ( from one square to the other ) If you succeed , and he/she ca n't return it , that is called an ace . You get one point ( 15-15 ) Now you go back to where you started . ( It alternates each point ) Now , you serve , and your opponent hits it back to you . It has to go over the net , and in front the line from where you serve , and not in the two boxes at the sides of the court . ( Only in play for doubles ) It is 40-30 now . You score . You win the game . NOT THE WHOLE GAME ! The whole game is called a match . A match is seperated into sets , then games . You win the first set , ( out of your choise , 3 or 5 sets . ) 6-4 .

"how to concentrate a UV light to a coherent light ? this question does n't make sense ( it 's incoherent HAH ! sorry.. corny joke . ) light from a light bulb is called incoherent light because it 's made up of many different waves . waves as you know have a property called phase , which tells you where along the wave-front you are at a given position and time . incoherent light is a mixture of light waves with random phases.coherent light on the other hand , is used to describe light where all of the waves have the same phase - so the waves peak and trough at exactly the same time and position . coherent light is much more intense than incoherent light because all of the phase fronts add up constructively , and so you end up with a very large amplitude wave.so , if you `` concentrate '' UV light , by using a lens or some other sort of focusing device , it will be more intense than the spread-out light , but it wo n't be coherent . the only way to get coherent light is at the source - for instance , an excimer laser can be tuned to emit in the ultraviolet , and the light will be coherent . there is no ( known ) way to convert incoherent light into coherent light , though that 's not to say it 's impossible - such a thing just has n't been invented .",0

"what happens when you quit a job because of depression ? Can you get it back ? I quit my job as a teacher due to expected bouts of depression . I went to a doctor . I was told by a rep that I had to quit since I was so new . I mean I didnt get formally diagnosed or treated . I didnt want to quit , but I felt it was my only option . I want to be a teacher again in the NYC Teaching Fellows . They said they dont reinstate anyone , however , this was unexpected and it is a illness . With treatment , I can improve . What are the chances that I can plead for my job back ? When you quit a job for any reason , you do n't usually have the option of getting it back just by asking . You will probably have to reapply to the position -- if it 's still available -- and go through the whole interview process again.The only way this situation would have been different due to your depression would be if they had offered short-term disability . I 'm not sure if this was offered , especially since you were new , but this option typically puts your position on hold while you are recovering/going through treatment . However , doing this for mental illnesses is n't always the same as a physical injury/disability , as it 's usually more helpful for a person to keep working and going through a normal routine.Anyway , it seems like you will probably have to reapply to the position . If you were forced to quit though , rather than go on disability , you might have a legal case against them , but this is only a guess .",0

"do you know any history on offset printing , who it was invented by and when they invented it ? The first lithographic offset printing press was created in England around 1875 and was designed for printing on metal . The offset cylinder was covered with specially treated cardboard that transferred the printed image from the litho stone to the surface of the metal . About five years later , the cardboard covering of the offset cylinder was changed to rubber , which is still the most commonly used material.The first person to use an offset press to print on paper was probably American Ira Washington Rubel in 1903 . He got the idea accidentally by noticing that whenever a sheet of paper was not fed into his lithographic press during operation , the stone printed its image to the rubber-covered impression cylinder , and the next impression had an image on both sides : direct litho on the front and an image from the rubber blanket on the back . Rubel then noticed that the image on the back of the sheet was much sharper and clearer than the direct litho image because the soft rubber was able to press the image onto the paper better than the hard stone . He soon decided to build a press which printed every image from the plate to the blanket and then to the paper . Brothers Charles and Albert Harris independently observed this process at about the same time and developed an offset press for the Harris Automatic Press Company soon after .",0

"Why is Curling a sport much less and Olympic event ? Seriously ... .Curling ? ... My Brother in law ( who I love very much ) is a big , burly biker who co-owns a strip bar ... .and NASCAR , foootball and yes.. loves Curling ... .I do n't get it ... . I think because anything classified as a sporting event it requires a certain degree of athleticism , skill , practice , dedication , and ( in the case of team sports ) team-work ; add in an opportunity to test your levels against others to find out who is best and you have a sporting event ( you mentioned NASCAR in your question details ... driving a car in a big circle for a couple of hours does n't require much athleticism either , but it is still considered a sport , right ? ) Now why it is considered an Olympic event ... well , it is a sport with growing popularity in many countries that participate in the Olympics ( Canada , many of the northern European countries , and a growing fan-base in the northern United States ) , and the Olympics have been a fairground for countries to show off new and/or unusual sporting events from around the world ( Ice Dancing ... the poor-man 's figure skating OR `` I 'm just doing this until Disney-on-Ice calls me in for an interview ! '' ) . Some of the events catch on and become world-wide phenomenons , others fizzle and die. < Added > I added athleticism to the list of skills needed because there is a degree of athleticism to curling that you do n't find in other strategy games ( chess , for example ) . I mean , watch the curlers in the Olympics . They are running around on ICE for Pete 's sake ! Any time I step on ice I fall on my ... personality ... but these guys are running up and down the ice as if they were walking in the grass ! And it is n't just the shoes they wear . I saw a documentary on the U.S. Olympic curling team and they showed people trying to do it and they were falling all over the place .",0
"My BF lost his drivers liscence for 3 months ? He lost his liscence for a few months , a ticket from a few years ago finally caught up to him.He rented a trailer from a company and it turned out to be unregistered.He got a ticket , told the rental company and they told him they would take care if it . Now , a few years later , it turns out that it is on his liscence as an unpaid/unanswered ticket and his licsence is now suspended for 90 days . I work a lot of hours and do not want to be his taxi service for the next three months.He also has a daughter from a previous relationship who lives almost an hour away . I realize he should made sure the ticket was taken care of.His daughter is involved in lots of activities on weekends , but I have things I want to do also , and do n't think its fair to spend the next 12 weekends on call to drive them around . The girl 's mother is kind of uninterested in her and goes out partying every weekend.We get her every other weekend , the mom goes out regardless . Am I being unreasonable ?

"what is your definition of myoelastic-aerodynamics ? ? ? Myoelastic-aerodynamic TheoryEarly voice researchers in the 1950 's and 1960 's explained vocal fold oscillation with the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory . According to these theories , Bernoulli forces ( negative pressure ) cause the vocal folds to be sucked together , creating a closed airspace below the glottis . Continued air pressure from the lungs builds up underneath the closed folds . Once this pressure becomes high enough , the folds are blown outward , thus opening the glottis and releasing a single 'puff ' of air . The lateral movement of the vocal folds continues until the natural elasticity of the tissue takes over , and the vocal folds move back to their original , closed position . Then , the cycle begins again . Each cycle produces a single small puff of air ; the sound of the human voice is nothing more than tens or hundreds of these small puffs of air being released every second and filtered by the vocal tract . Let 's further examine the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory . Myo- means muscle ; the vocal folds , after all , are mostly comprised of muscle tissue . The -elastic suffix serves to remind us that the vocal fold is elastic and that we have active control over its elastic properties . Aerodynamic means that the theory deals with the motion of air and other gaseous fluids , and with the forces active on bodies in motion ( such as the vocal folds ) in relation to such fluids .",0

"i want to know everything about GENETICS. ? Genetics , scientific study of how physical , biochemical , and behavioural traits are transmitted from parents to their offspring . The word itself was coined in 1906 by the British biologist William Bateson . Geneticists determine the mechanisms of inheritance whereby the offspring of sexually reproducing organisms do not exactly resemble their parents , and the differences and similarities between parents and offspring recur from generation to generation in repeated patterns . The investigation of these patterns has led to some of the most exciting discoveries in modern biology.Soon after Mendel 's work was rediscovered , scientists realized that the patterns of inheritance he had described paralleled the action of chromosomes in dividing cells , and they proposed that the Mendelian units of inheritance , the genes , are carried by the chromosomes . This led to intensive studies of cell division.Every cell comes from the division of a pre-existing cell . All the cells that make up a human being , for example , are derived from the successive divisions of a single cell , the zygote ( see Fertilization ) , which is formed by the union of an egg and a sperm . The great majority of the cells produced by the division of the zygote are , in the composition of their hereditary material , identical to one another and to the zygote itself ( assuming that no mutations occur ; see below ) . Each cell of a higher organism is composed of a jellylike layer of material , the cytoplasm , which contains many small structures . This cytoplasmic material surrounds a prominent body called the nucleus . Every nucleus contains a number of minute , threadlike chromosomes . Some relatively simple organisms , such as cyanobacteria and bacteria , have no distinct nucleus but do have cytoplasm , which contains one or more chromosomes.Chromosomes vary in size and shape and usually occur in pairs . The members of each pair , called homologues , closely resemble each other . Most cells in the human body contain 23 pairs of chromosomes , whereas most cells of the fruit fly Drosophila contain four pairs , and the bacterium Escherichia coli has a single chromosome in the form of a ring . Every chromosome in a cell is now known to contain many genes , and each gene is located at a particular site , or locus , on the chromosome.The process of cell division by which a new cell comes to have an identical number of chromosomes as the parent cell is called mitosis ( see Reproduction ) . In mitotic division each chromosome divides into two equal parts , and the two parts travel to opposite ends of the cell . After the cell divides , each of the two resulting cells has the same number of chromosomes and genes as the original cell ( see Cell : Division , Reproduction , and Differentiation ) . Every cell formed in this process thus has the same genetic material . Simple one-celled organisms and some multicellular forms reproduce by mitosis ; it is also the process by which complex organisms achieve growth and replace worn-out tissue.Higher organisms that reproduce sexually are formed from the union of two special sex cells known as gametes . Gametes are produced by meiosis , the process by which germ cells divide . It differs from mitosis in one important way : in meiosis a single chromosome from each pair of chromosomes is transmitted from the original cell to each of the new cells . Thus , each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes that are found in the other body cells . When two gametes unite in fertilization , the resulting cell , called the zygote , contains the full , double set of chromosomes . Half of these chromosomes normally come from one parent and half from the other.For more than 50 years after the science of genetics was established and the patterns of inheritance through genes were clarified , the largest questions remained unanswered : how are the chromosomes and their genes copied from cell to cell , and how do they direct the structure and behaviour of living things ?

"Learning about Programming Data Structures ? I have been programming on my own for several months now . Using HTML , CSS , PHP and more recently C # .

"why is there only one timezone in china ? There is only one time-zone in China because the government there regulates it to be that way . Time-zones are largely a convention , and given the use of UTC time ( Universal Coordinated Time / Greenwich Mean Time ) , time-zones are not entirely necessary . They are predominantly kept because of familiarity and historical convention . That said , in China it is easier for the nation to function administratively with only one time-zone , so they have chosen that . In the United States , the government chose to have time-zones for the people over administrative reasons ... although some regions of the country ( such as parts of Indiana and Arizona ) have selected rules that do not follow the national norm ( i.e . they do n't use Daylight Savings Time ) .",0

"who discovered the atom ? Democritus and Leucippus , Greek philosophers in the 5th century BC , presented the first theory of atoms ( see article atomism for more details ) . The Greeks believed that atoms were all made of the same material but had different shapes and sizes , which determined the physical properties of the material . For instance , the atoms of a liquid were thought to be smooth , allowing them to slide over each other . This theory was not founded on experimental evidence.In 1808 , John Dalton proposed that an element is composed of a single , unique type of atoms , and that whilst their shape or structure was immutable , atoms of different elements could combine to form more complex structures ( compounds ) . Through his experiments , Dalton discovered the law of multiple proportions - that is , if two elements form more than one compound between them , then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers .",0

"why is the risk of semen-to-mouth transmission less than semen-to-vagina ? Risk of HIV transmission from semen to vagina is supposed to be because of vaginal mucus membrane absorbing the virus . Mouth surface is also mucus membrane . So why risk of semen-to-mouth transmission is less than semen-to-vagina ? OK , ignoring the overly-emotional responses that some people have had to this question , it actually IS true that semen-to-mouth sex carries less of a risk of HIV transmission than semen-to-vagina . One caveat , though : The risk is NOT zero . Oral sex DOES carry a risk . Smaller , but a risk.Why ? No one has 100 % figured out . However , it is postulated that the digestive enzymes present in the saliva do a number on the HIV virus and are able to knock out a fair amount of the infectious little buggers . The vaginal secretions do n't contain these enzymes.So , no , our youth are NOT being lied to .",0

"CAN ANYBODY CLARIFY ? If a person suffered from amnesia and then was cured would they remember that they forgot ? It is hard to say.The underlying cause of amnesia is critical to answer this question.If you are talking a traumatic event to the brain , then the memories could be permanetly lost . The physical structure of the brain could have been damaged beyond repair and the information contained there would be lost.Sometimes , the area is just injured and takes time to heal . In this case , over time the memories would begin to come back as the brain reroutes synapses to accommodate the injury.If it was a psychological amensia , then it may or may not come back depending on how the person can cope with the experience . In this case , there is usually very little physical brain involvment.In general , in a highly stressfulevent , adrenalize and stres hormones cause memory to be faulty at best . So in an crisis people rarely recollect events in the most accurate manner.For a whole lot of unsubsantiated opinion , see the Wikipedia entry : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmnesiaOr for Types of amnesia : http : //ahsmail.uwaterloo.ca/kin356/amnesia/amnesia2.htmlhttp : //www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php ? newsid=9673For a better reference check out http : //news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/a-b/167771.stm",0

"Nicolatians believe ... .. ? In the bible . The doctrine of the Nicolaitans was mentioned in the Apocalypse of John to the churches of Pergamos and Ephesus of the seven churches of Asia in Revelation 2 . It was a symbolic name of a party that represents the hierarchy of a ruling class over the rest of the people , developing a `` pecking order '' of fleshly leadership . Jesus hated this and warns the people to repent or else `` I will come upon you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth . '' The same warning illustration is applied to those that abused grace , which led to licentiousness from the example of Balaam , seducing Christians to fornication and tampering with idolatry . The individual overcomer is allowed to eat of the hidden manna and given a white stone with a new name written in it.The Early church father Iranaeus , identified the Nicolaitans in his treatise `` Against Heresies '' in the second century as they who are an `` offshoot of the knowledge which is falsely so-called , '' mentioning that they `` lead lives of unrestrained indulgence . '' There is no absolute proof that the heretic Nicolas was the Deacon of the same name from Antioch of the seven deacons in the book of Acts , but Iranaeus supposed him to be so . Ignatius mentions the Nicolaitans also , so there was in fact a heretical group existing at that time . Nicolas the deacon was perhaps confused with another Nicolas , the bishop Nicolas of Samaria who was a heretic in the company of Simon Magus.The root of the word Nicolaitans comes from Greek nikao , to conquer or overcome , and laos , which means people and which the word laity comes from . The two words together especially means the destruction of the people and refers to the earliest form of what we call a priestly order or clergy which later on in church history divided people and allowed for leadership other than those led by the spirit of the risen Lord Jesus Christ . A good translation of Nicolaitan would be `` those who prevail over the people . '' This clerical system later developed into the papal hierarchy of priests and clergy lording over the flock . The Council of Trent stated , `` If anyone shall say that there is not in the Catholic Church a hierarchy established by the divine ordination , consisting of bishops , presbyters and ministers , let him be anathema . '' It is not the question of the ministries but rather in the separation of them into a hierarchy over the people . This very idea was taken over by the Protestants with their own corruption of leadership roles and coverings . The Church of Ephesus was commended for hating the deeds of the Nicolaitans . The wrong separation of the clergy from the laity is a great evil in God 's sight and He hates the lust for religious power . There is an ungodly spiritual authority in the Church today , which is nothing more than the prideful spirit of control , manipulation , domination and intimidation and a rebellion of the rightful authority of God.Faithful believers who have put on Christ Jesus , are all God 's laity . Peter exhorted us to Feed the flock of God which is among you , taking the oversight thereof , not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind . Neither as being lords over God 's heritage but being examples to the flock . And when the chief shepherd shall appear , you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.Shepherds serve the sheep but the wolves that clothe themselves with so-called leadership and spiritual authority serve themselves , thinking that they serve God . In essence , this makes them false christs . Early church leaders were established as overseers , not a ruling hierarchy .",0

What is the difference between a savings account and a money market account ? Money Market accounts typically offer a much higher rate of return than savings accounts .

They also adjust to the current interest rate much faster than savings accounts which typically move like molasses on a winter day .,0

"where is euthanasia legalized ? authanasia is legalized in Australia Belgium The Netherlands Oregon ( United States ) However , there are two types of euthanasia - active and passive . 1 . Active Euthanasia : a positive action is taken to bring about someone ’ s death e.g . the administering of a deadly injection or the assisting in preparations for a suicide2 . Passive Euthanasia involves a refusal to intervene to change the course of events , where the result is the death of the person.All of these countries support Assisted Euthanasia -a second party ( usually a physician ) participates in bringing about the patient ’ s death , but is not the sole cause of the death . Netherland for example allows permits physician assisted dying when each of the following conditions is fulfilled : the patient 's suffering is unbearable with no prospect of improvement the patient 's request for euthanasia must be voluntary and persist over time ( The request can not be granded when under the influence of others , psychological illness or drugs ) the patient must be fully aware of his/her condition , prospects and options there must be consultation with at least one other independent docter who needs to confirm the conditions mentioned above the death must be carried out in a medically appropriate fashion by the doctor or patient , in which case the doctor must be present . the patient is at least 12 years old ( patients between 12 and 16 years of age require the consent of their parents ) these laws are different in each of these countries .",0

"What is Ash Wednesday ? Ash Wednesday , today , is the beginning of the Catholic religious season of Lent . Lent is a time period where most Catholics choose something to give up ( often sweets , dessert , porn , gambling ) that they tend to indulge in . It is a period of 40 days when Catholics remember the 40 days Jesus fasted in the desert and his ultimate sacrifice at the end of Lent , Good Friday . Marti Gras ( french for Fat Tuesday ) has traditionally become the time for celebration as a last big fling before Lent arrives and people try to restrict themselves more . Also , during Lent , Catholics are supposed to avoid meat other than fish on fridays . On Ash Wednesday , Catholics go to a church service during which the entire congregation processes up to have the priest place ashes on their forehead as a reminder that `` of dust we were made and to dust we shall return '' and our own mortalities .",0

"Why is this Alito guy such big news ? I 've been reading about this Alito guy but I do n't understand why is such big news . From what I understand he 's being interviewed for Judge of the Supreme Court . Is there a piece of information I 've missed ? Why is that such big news ? It just seems like a regular political process . It is a regular political process . True , the parties are bickering as usual , but there has always been controversy surrounding new Supreme Court justices . If everyone 's political party was swiched ( Bush would become a Democrat , for example ) , the exact same ranker would be going on . Justices are the top echelon of the legal system , so they are very important . Also , they are appointed for life , so you had better make sure you 're picking the right guy . Unfortunately , Mr. Alito is being confirmed during a particularly nasty period of political polarization , so many of the questions and issues are n't real questions , they 're sensationalist propaganda from both sides of the isle . In case you missed the memo , abortion is NOT the only legal question of the day , yet that seems to be what most of the fuss is about . Lastly , since they are appointed for life , this man has the potential power to influence American jurisprudential thought for perhaps the next 30 or 40 years . Needless to say , he 'll be making rulings long after Bush is gone , and the next guy , and the next guy . He 'll also survive Republicans losing their majority in Congress , then gaining it , then losing it , etc . So essentially , theres a big fuss because they are getting ready to install someone who is going to effecting law ( and by extention politics ) for many years to come . I personally think the Court will be fine with Alito because , unlike the talking heads on CNN and FoxNews who seem fixated on abortion and other trivial matters , I 've been watching the hearings live and reading the transcripts ( I 'm a law student ) , and he actually seems less polarizingly conservative and more qualified than even Republicans are admitting to .",0

"A child is suffereing from cardiac myopathy and she is given 24 hours medicne injected ( connected to machine ) D Doctors suggest she can live only with support of medicines . Is that true . Is there any other solution . she is only 1 year old . So surgery is not possible.Is there any cure for such patients how long they can survive , can they live without medicine . plesase advice Cardiomyopathy is a chronic and sometimes progressive disease in which the heart muscle ( myocardium ) , is abnormally enlarged , thickened and/or stiffened . The condition typically begins in the walls of the heart 's lower chambers ( ventricles ) , and in more severe cases also affects the walls of the upper chambers ( atria ) . The actual muscle cells as well as the surrounding tissues of the heart become damaged . Eventually , the weakened heart loses the ability to pump blood effectively and heart failure or irregular heartbeats ( arrhythmias or dysrhythmia ) may occur . The medication that she is being given is probably being used to help the heart contract or function better . The medication being given by machine is just to make sure it is n't given too quickly because of how small your child is.It is likely she will need some sort of medication the rest of her life . If she is a candidate for a heart transplant , she will still need to be on some sort of medication the rest of her life.You need to speak to your daughters Pediatrian or Cardiac Doctor if you have questions .

"If we are on earth , are weight and mass equal . why or why not ? No matter where you are , weight and mass are different things .

If you were to choose a set of units where either your mass or the acceleration due to gravity were equal to 1 at some point on earth , then your mass and weight would have an equal value , but that would only be true in those units , for your mass , at that point on earth , and does n't mean that the two concepts are equal .

"What 's the difference in modulo and remainders ? What 's the difference between the remainder and modulo in programming ? I know some languages use modulo while others use % .

I do n't think we 're helping Iraq . I do n't think we should be `` helping '' Iraq . In fact , the U.S. has a very poor track record `` helping '' other countries .

It may feed people for a short time , but it wo n't improve the economy . Mexico is poor because it is poor in natural resources , especially in arable land .

"what is `` strain ? '' ? Strain describes the % change in length of an object in the same direction of the load . Strain is almost always used with the word stress which is the reason there is strain . Stress is a force distributed over an area . If you take a 1/2 '' diameter steel pin and it is 1 '' long and you put 100 lbs on one end and the other end on the ground , you put 100lbs/.20in*in or 500 psi into the pin . Now visualize the pin being crushed under this load . The 1 '' distance between the end faces is no longer 1 '' . Say a measurement shows that under this load the pin is 0.998 '' . The strain , measured in inches per inch , is the change .002 '' divided by the length . In this case .002/1=.002 inches per inch . So the strain would be .002 in/in . ( In real life , the strain from a 100 lb load on a steel 1/2 '' pin would be very difficult to measure . ) See Poisson 's ratio which specifically deals with the different strain rates based on material properties .",0

"Before the Dodgers where brooklyn or Los Angeles they had 4 different names can you name them ? Names were a bit fluid then , and they were called by lots of names ( The official website lists `` Bridegrooms , Trolly Dodgers , Superbas , Ward 's Wonders , and Foutz ' Fillies '' ) : The moniker `` Bridegrooms '' was attached to Manager William `` Gunner '' McGunnigle 's 1890 ballclub because seven of the players got married around the same time in 1888 . Despite the success of the Bridegrooms , McGunnigle did n't last past the initial year and the team paraded through six different managers before the end of the decade . The skippers included John Montgomery Ward ( 1891-92 ) , Dave Foutz ( 1893-96 ) , William Barnie ( 1897-98 ) , Mike Griffin ( 1898 ) , Charles H. Ebbets ( 1898 ) and Ned Hanlon ( 1899-1905 ) . The term `` Trolley Dodgers '' was attached to the Brooklyn ballclub due to the complex maze of trolley cars that weaved its way through the borough of Brooklyn . The name was then shortened to just `` Dodgers . '' During the 1890s , other popular nicknames were Ward 's Wonders , Foutz 's Fillies and Hanlon 's Superbas .",0

"who is better clinton or bush ?

( opinion ) -Economy has been down for quite some time -Is much less liked internationally ( and domestically too ) They 've both done good things , I think too.CLINTON - -Economy flurished -US well respected in worldBUSH - -Willing to do what it takes to keep America safe . ( By attacking Afghanistan , something Clinton would n't do with previous attacks . ) -Has GREATLY increased free trade in the western hemisphere ( although there are some farmers in Mexico and other S.American places that say free trade hurts them . ) Overall , I think that both presidents did the best they could and that their actions ( especially Bush 's ) are more of a response to circumstances outside their control . I do n't think , for example , ( and many do ) that Bush intended to go to war when he was elected . I do n't think that Clinton thought he was lying . ( I think he thought he used clever words to hide what he actually did . He used the word 'sexual relations ' which he interpreted to mean 'sexual intercorce ' and he only had oral sex . ) So either way , I do n't think that either president has really hurt or help America in any appreciable way .

HUNDREDS OF WOMEN HAVE AN AGGRESSIVE FORM OF BREAST CANCER AND MANY OF THOSE HAVE HAD THE COSTLY DRUG PAID BY THEIR LOCAL NHS IN FEAR OF BEING SUED AND SOME HAVE LOST THEIR LEGAL BATTLE . sHOULD THE GOVERNEMENT SHELL OUT FOR ALL SUFFERES TO BE GIVEN THE 'WONDER ' DRUG You must be in the UK , as you mention NHS . A colleague of mine who is an SHO ( senior house officer=resident ) there , tells me there 's lot 's of waste in that system . If women with HER-2/NEU positive breast cancer ( which as you mention are a small percentage ) were to receive the drug free of charge , I do n't think it would break your system . From what I hear the NHS ( British National Health Service ) has more problems than giving away expensive drugs . The system probably wastes more money with unnecessary ambulance rides per year than herceptin . But of course this is just heresay on my part . Universal health care is great , however , like everything there need to be checks and balances . The bottom line is poor patients should receive the same standard of care as the wealthy patient . People who cry about paying higher taxes probably would n't even notice the difference . Our military ( in which I was a former member USMC ) wastes more money per hour than this drug would cost us in a year .",0

"what are the seven wonders of the world ? This gets asked daily ... .The 7 wonders of the ancient world : * The Great Pyramid of Giza It is the one and only Ancient Wonder which does not require a description by early historians and poets . It is the one and only Ancient Wonder that does not need speculations concerning its appearance , size , and shape . It is the oldest , yet it is the only surviving of the Seven Ancient Wonders . It is the Great Pyramid of Giza . * The Hanging Gardens of Babylon Some stories indicate the Hanging Gardens towered hundreds of feet into the air , but archaeological explorations indicate a more modest , but still impressive , height . * The Statue of Zeus at Olympia This is a statue of the God in whose honor the Ancient Olympic games were held . It was located on the land that gave its very name to the Olympics . At the time of the games , wars stopped , and athletes came from Asia Minor , Syria , Egypt , and Sicily to celebrate the Olympics and to worship their king of Gods : Zeus . * The Colossus of Rhodes The island of Rhodes was an important economic centre in the ancient world . It is located off the southwestern tip of Asia Minor where the Aegean Sea meets the Mediterranean . The capitol city , also named Rhodes , was built in 408 B.C * The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus Eight hundred years after its destruction , the magnificent Temple of Artemis at Ephesus , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , had been completely forgotten by the people of the town that had once held it in such pride… * The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is the burial place of an ancient king . Yet the Mausoleum is different - so different from the Pyramid that it earned its reputation - and a spot within the list - for other reasons . Geographically , it is closer to the Temple of Artemis ... And it was the beauty of the tomb rather than its size that fascinated its visitors for years . * The Pharos of Alexandria ( The Lighthouse of Alexandria ) Of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , only one had a practical use in addition to its architectural elegance : The Lighthouse of Alexandria . For sailors , it ensured a safe return to the Great Harbor . For architects , it meant even more : it was the tallest building on Earth . And for scientists , it was the mysterious mirror that fascinated them most ... The mirror which reflection could be seen more than 50 km ( 35 miles ) off-shore.Of those , opnly the Pyramids remain today.There are more modern wonders : * Great Pyramid of Giza* Great Wall of China* Taj Mahal* Serengeti Migration* Galapagos Islands* Grand Canyon* Machu PicchuModern world : * Channel Tunnel* CN Tower* Empire State Building* Golden Gate Bridge* Itaipu Dam* Netherlands ' Tidal Defences* Panama CanalNatural wonders : * Grand Canyon* Great Barrier Reef* Harbor of Rio de Janeiro* Mount Everest* Northern Lights* Paricutín volcano* Victoria FallsUnderwater wonders : PalauBelize Barrier ReefGreat Barrier ReefDeep-Sea VentsGalapagos IslandsLake BaikalNorthern Red Sea",0

Support your answer by drawing from a Sociological Perspective . I am not a sociologist but I will answer as an American who follows world events rather closely . If we do not do something to help defend this country then we will no longer cease to exist as a country . There are so many people that want America destroyed that it takes a lot of soldiers , marines , CIA , etc to avert total disaster in this country .

"When does state law supercede Federal law ? Federal law is , by virtue of the constitution , the `` law of the land , '' meaning that it supersedes in every instance where they may pass laws covering the same issue . On things like minimum wage , it 's not really an issue of superseding ; if federal law says it must be $ 5.15 or more , and state law says it must be $ 7.50 or more , the state law is within the requirements of the federal law . If the state law were less than $ 5.15 , the federal law would supersede it , because it would not be within the federal law 's requirements .",0

"what 3d geometric shape has 3 faces and 2 sides ?

"do you think us gov is going correct ? noooooooooo ! ! ! ! they are always arrogant and think they are superior to others By `` us gov '' I assume you mean the current administration . Or do you mean to include congress ? In either case , the answer is generally , no . I 'm terribly disappointed . Or rather , not really disappointed , because I did not expect much from GWB . But the structure of our government is still pretty good , and our Constitution is just fine , thank you . Do n't you wish the current crop of idiots paid attention to it once in awhile ? The problem I see in this country is that the vast majority of voters figure their choices are limited to the two largest parties . Problem is , they have been trading off power trips and making back-room deals between them for so long , that does not give us much in the way of a choice.But we have a strong and promising third party coming up fast : the Libertarian Party . We libertarians believe that a government should be small enough to fit inside the Constitution . We would disassemble the beaurocracy , stop butting into other countries ' business , and trust the individual adult citizen to make his or her own choices about private matters . We believe market forces would solve many of the problems that protectionism and favoritism only make worse . And we believe that taxes should be eliminated if possible , or at least reduced to no more than it would take to run those operations that can not be accomplished any other way . If the state can do it , then the feds should let them . If the county can do it , the state should let them . If the individual can do it , then let him alone . If the individual can not do it , let voluntary organizations and other structures at the local level help . Because the larger the unit set with the task of solving a given problem , the less efficient it will inevitably be . Perhaps the coordination necessary for defense operations would require a federal structure , but I personally can not think of anything else that needs to be done on such a scale . Can you ?",0

"16 year difference in age - college teacher/ former student . How long before it ends ? I am curious as to other 's ideas . My ex-husband , a professional ethics prof , left me for one of his former students . She was then 20 , he 36 . We 's been married 13 years , together 15+ and it was very sudden . She knew he was married , and she was in lesbian relationship living with lover ; never been with man . Huge power differential , and she is still a student so he pays for all her living expenses in the apartment they share . She went from her female lovers place , where she dropped the bomb , to my ex 's new apartment in one day.Part of me feels that it was a mid-life crisis , but he invested so much he ca n't ever tell me so or apologize to me.Thoughts ? Know of similar prof/student relationships that worked long haul ? ? ? She could have been just struggling financially and looking for a sugar daddy . Or she might be serious about him , who knows .

"why the police is not cancelling the driver 's lic of D U I ? Wow ! The police do not actually cancel the driver 's license . Not local police.The State Highway Patrol actually terminate your license . A court will normally decide on the suspension of a license for other than a non-payment of a annual license fee . The officer of the law simply writes the Citation , the `` Ticket '' . The State Police or Highway Patrol is the Agency responsible for the issue and control statewide for the license , and will simply carry out the orders of the Court . The `` Court '' is simply a Judge . Local Police do not ordinarily carry out these duties , but if a Judge so orders they will so act . Really nothing is unusual about it.So the Police Officer can give you a break only at the time when he is writing the Citation , or just prior to actual Court . Once a decision by a Judge has been rendered , it is out of the Officer 's hands . HE CAN NOT CANCEL ANYTHING ! APS",0

"How do you change direction when swimming freestyle in a pool ? You know what I mean : good swimmers just kind of do a 180 and then kick off in the opposite direction . It 's clear that you have to flip over and turn over , but I find it tricky . I 'm generally very coordinated , so I think I just need some tips . A flip turn is done by basically gliding into the wall and flipping into a back-stroke glid and eventually turning back onto your front . With your momentum carrying you into the wall , tuck your head under so your upper torso will be on its back . Your legs will follow over and the momentum will carry your legs into the wall . In the glide position on your back slowly turn back onto your front . As you improve and get your orientation you will be able to flip while on your side , and will be able to more efficiently do your turn . Things to watch when turning , work on your timing coming into the wall . You will need to be able to judge when you should start your flip turns , that 's what the T on the lane lines are for . Keep from going to deep when doing your turns . Keep your body stream lined into the wall and coming off the wall . Think of your body as hinged at your hips and keep both halves extended when flipping - only the hinge bends . Good luck .",0
"I can understand people not believing in God and Christianity or any other religion , but why insult it ? Why is it ok to curse , be mean to people , talk about and exploit sex , etc . in public and everywhere you go , but if you speak of God , Pray , or wear clothing with scriptures or anything like that you are offending people ? Even if you do n't believe in God and religion , look at the people who truly do believe and live their lives by the Word . Look at how they act . They are kind , caring , respectful and they donate money to charities and volunteer for things . So whether or not you think God is real , the people who do have become better people because of their belief . So in my mind 's eye , those who believe with their heart and confess with their mouth Jesus is indeeed our Saviour are 1 : If it 's all real then they are going to spend eternity with the Father 2 : Either way they are really good people.As for me I believe without a doubt but I struggle with living right . I have had a few experiences that made my belief stronger than ever . I still have to work on how I lead my life . Let 's face it -- it 's easier to insult or make fun of believers than to put that mantle on.You know what it 's like -- it 's not called `` the straight and narrow '' for nothing . I would n't say it 's true for all , but for many it 's just a case of not seeing any kind of benefit -- material , I 'm pretty sure -- to justify their committiment of time , let alone sacrifice.Why do you think so many people question God 's lack of intervention in natural disasters or tragic deaths ? These people all think it 's some kind of cause/effect relationship . You screw up -- God bails you out . If things go wrong , there ca n't be a God -- otherwise He 'd have stopped it.So many of these people are just jaded from the bombardment of so much content that they absorb -- TV , movies , the Internet . There 's plenty of crap to catch hold of , I have no doubt.They 're just so busy trying to disprove our beliefs they ca n't bother seeing the kinds of people they insult . As far as that goes , most of these folks see Christians as one big happy Pat Robertson family . Unfortunately , those that speak the loudest get the most attentio.I always figure every post from one of these folks is just another opportunity for me to witness . Maybe 99 times I 'll just be wasting my time . But who knows about the other 1 ? None of us are perfect , but you are certainly walking the right path . Let these lost souls both strengthen your faith and provide you a powerful incentive to keep witnessing God 's love and Jesus ' sacrifice for our sins . Go in peace and go with God.While I stand behind all the words I wrote above , I felt I had to add to this post in reaction to your additonal comments about prayer in school . I do n't know exactly what the context is , but I find it very troubling . As a Christian , I believe prayer to be the most direct link I have with God . But the notion that prayer should somehow be forced upon students or encouraged in a public school is not just unconstitutional but morally repugnant to me . Even voluntary prayer is patently coersive in my opinion . I think you are a well-meaning but misguided person who does need to work more on how you lead your life . A little bit more tolerance for those who do n't share your beliefs would be as welcome as others ' tolerance for yours .",0

"How do people steal and live with themselves ? Do n't you know you are the bottomfeeders of the earth ? There are two questions you ask.1 . ) -- Conciousness is strong feeling ( nature of which , by the way is impossible to describe from atheistic perspective ) which hardly gives you a break . Therefore it is hard to live if you steal . However , if someone repeats crime over and over again his conciouseness get used to it more and more so he/she lives pretty good with stealing. -- Also , ( it is not excuse though ) , people can steal for a different purposes ... self-preservation most powerful probably ... 2 ) -- Second question I do n't uderstand .

I 'm not from the US , but that animosity is reserved for obese ppl the world over ! ! I think it has to do with the misconception that fat ppl got fat cause they have no control over their eating habits and therefore appear to have low self-control , are indisciplined and weak.It 's wrong , of course . But its human nature to feel superior to any perceived notion of lack of discipline or weakness .

"When God created the world , He made one . Why then are our skins different & We marry when we should be sibbling There was a time when people were hunter-gatherers and lived a nomadic lifestyle . Because of this , the population spread throughout the world . Over time , peoples ' skin colors changed to adapt to the amount and intensity of the sun where they lived . For example , people closer to the equator developed darker skin because they got a lot of sunlight and people closer to the poles developed lighter skin because they got a lot less sunlight . That 's why people have different skin colors . Why do people marry when we are really all distant relatives ? Well , if the Biblical accounts are to be accepted , the simple truth is that we do marry our far-distant relatives . In fact , in the South , when a person marries , one of the questions on the marriage application is , `` are you related by blood ? '' . It is not uncommon in that area of the country , and is allowed by law , for second cousins to marry .",0

"what are nephillims ( ? ) are they the offspring of the fallen angels ? The Nephilim ( fallen ones , giants ) were the offspring of sexual relationships between the sons of God and daughters of men in Genesis 6:1-4 . There is much debate as to the identity of the `` sons of God '' ( see our article on this subject here ) . I believe the correct view is that they were fallen angels ( demons ) who mated with human females and/or possessed human males and then mated with human females . These unions resulted in offspring that were `` heroes of old , men of renown '' ( Genesis 6:4 ) . What were the Nephilim ? According to Hebrew and other legends ( the Book of Enoch and other non-Biblical writings ) , they were a race of giants and super-heroes who did acts of great evil . Their great size and power likely came from the mixture of demonic `` DNA '' with human genetics . All that the Bible directly says about them is that they were `` heroes of old , men of renown '' ( Genesis 6:4 ) . The Nephilim were not aliens , they were literal , physical beings produced from the union of the sons of God and daughters of men ( Genesis 6:1-4 ) .",0

It will be a word that you should have been studying in class.Ie. , Adaptation - mutations that give an organism an advantageMutation - alterations in genetic makeupEvolution - changes in organisms over time due to adaptationNatural Selection - conditions which select adaptationsI would go with adaptation , but no guarantees . The concept here is that as we take antibiotics we kill a lot of bacteria , but not all of them . The remaining few that survive are the `` tougher '' ones , at least ones that are n't affected as much by the antibiotics . These remaining bacteria may continue to grow in numbers . If they ever succeed in infecting more people , the antibiotics will now do nothing.P.S ... A lot of people think that bacteria randomly mutate until one of them becomes resistant . This is only part of the story . Antibiotics almost always originate from other bacteria , or some other organism trying to fend off bacteria . These antibiotics are not new , just new to medicine . Bacteria have been resisting these antibiotics for millions of years . Maybe not actively , but somewhere in their past it has probably been encountered .

Britain raising taxes on the colonist to help defray the costs of the French and Indian War-the colonist protested and refused to pay the taxes.3 . Boston Massacre in 1770 which was used as American propoganda against the British when in fact it was a large crowd threatening a small group of British soldiers who either fired accidently or out of fear for their lives4 .

"why is 13 considered unlucky ? Triskaidekaphobia is the fear of 13 , a number commonly associated with bad luck in Western culture . While fear of the number 13 can be traced back to medieval times , the word triskaidekaphobia itself is of recent vintage , having been first coined by Coriat ( 1911 ; Simpson and Weiner 1992 ) . It seems to have first appeared in the general media in a Nov. 8 , 1953 New York Times article covering discussions of a United Nations committee . This superstition leads some people to fear or avoid anything involving the number 13 . In particular , this leads to interesting practices such as the numbering of floors as 1 , 2 , ... , 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 , ... ( Sloane 's A011760 ; the `` elevator sequence '' ) , omitting the number 13 , in many high-rise American hotels , the numbering of streets avoiding 13th Avenue , and so on . Apparently , 13 has n't always been considered unlucky . In fact , it appears that in ancient times , 13 was either considered in a positive light or ( more commonly ) not at all ( Adams ) . The association of bad luck with the number 13 has been attributed to the fact there were 13 people at the Last Supper of Jesus , although this association seems to have originated only in medieval times . The association has also been linked to that fact that lunisolar calendars ( such as the Hebrew and Chinese calendars ) must have 13 months in some years in order to synchronize the solar and lunar cycles , while the solar Gregorian calendar in universal current usage always has 12 months in a year . Triskaidekaphobia also may be related to Norse mythology , which tells how the god Odin invited eleven of his closest friends to a dinner party at his home in Valhalla , only to have his party crashed by Loki , the god of evil and turmoil , thus giving a total of 13 people . The legend goes on to related how Balder , one of the most beloved gods , tired to throw Loki out of the party , resulting in a scuffle and ultimately Balder 's death with a mistletoe-tipped arrow . Fear of the number 13 also leads to fear of Friday the thirteenth ( a fear recently dubbed paraskevidekatriaphobia ) , despite the fact that Friday turns out to be the most common weekday on which the 13th of a month can occur in the Gregorian calendar . The association of bad luck with Friday appeared in Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales in the late 14th century ( `` and on a Friday fell all this misfortune '' ) , but references to Friday as a day associated with ill luck in general first appear around the middle of the 17th century ( Mikkelson and Mikkelson ) . In particular , it appeared in numerous publications as a particularly unlucky day to start a new venture ( beginning a journey , giving birth , getting married , moving , starting a new job , etc . ) beginning around 1800 ( Mikkelson and Mikkelson ) . While 13 is associated with the number of people at the Last Supper , the Crucifixion took place on a Friday , thus leading to an association of back luck with the combination of this number and day . Note that the association of Friday the thirteenth with the arrest of Jacques de Molay , Grand Master of the Knights Templar , on Friday , October 13 , 1307 by King Philip IV of France is a modern-day invention ( Mikkelson and Mikkelson ) . Paraskevidekatriaphobia is probably the most widespread superstition in the United States , possibly affecting tens of millions of Americans . Interestingly , a study by Scanlon et al . ( 1993 ) published in the prestigious British Medical Journal which analyzed the relation between health , behavior , and superstition surrounding Friday 13th in the United Kingdom by comparing the ratio of traffic volume to traffic accidents on Friday the 6th and Friday the 13th over a period of years found that , `` The risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52 % . Staying at home is recommended . '' While there does not appear to be hard evidence to support the claim , it has been suggested that $ 800 to $ 900 millio",0

I 'm in my 30 's now and am finally starting to get over the shyness . I still find it hard to talk to people I do n't know and to make friends . What I have found is that everyone else has insecurities just like me . Some people are just better at overcoming them.Some things I have found that work for me are going out with a best friend and some of her/his friends . That way you already know someone in the group and can gradually build relationships with the other members of the group . Go out and do something fun with them a few times so you can reminisce about those times to break the ice.I really have a tough time coming up with things to talk about with other people , so what I have done is read newspapers and magazines and watch TV that has interests like those of a person I am interested in getting to know . That way I have something to talk about . I never was one for meeting men . That is until one man at work caught my eye . We said polite hellos to each other , but that just was n't enough . I finally got up the nerve to talk to him . I walked right up , stuck out my hand , and said , `` I ca n't believe you have been here this long and I still do n't know your name .

"Does water evaporate faster in a warm room or a cool room ? 5th grade science project . We put equal aomounts of water in three plastic cups . One cup was put by a heat vent , another cup was put in the basement near a door and the third cup was put in the living room.The cups in the basement and the living room are evaporating at the same rate . The cup near the vent is evaporating faster . Why are the cups in the the basement and living evaporating and the same rate ? Why is the cup near the vent evaporating faster ? It 's to do with humidity of the air . If you watch the weather report you may notice that humidity is expressed as a percentage . This is how 'full ' the air is with water vapour . If the air is nearly empty ( low humidity ) then water will evaporate more quickly . If the air is full ( high humidity ) the water will evaporate more slowly ( it may even receive more water from the air ! ) .Here is the key : hot air can hold MORE water than cold air . So even if say a gallon of water is the most that some amount of air can hold , if you the air up the air will no longer be 'full ' ( for example it might be only 70 % full , hence 70 % humidity ) .This is not a complete answer as I do not know everything about it . It 's pretty advanced for 5th grade ( I learnt about it in the 11th grade ! ) . For more information look up EQUILIBRIUM in chemistry .",0

"why was the square deal so important ? During the 1904 campaign , Roosevelt called his actions in the coal miners ' strike a `` square deal '' for both labor and capital , a term that stuck to his administration . Roosevelt was not the first president to take a stand for labor , but he was the first to bring opposing sides in a labor dispute to the White House to settle it . He was the first to threaten to seize a major industry , and he was the first to appoint a commission whose decision both sides agreed to accept . `` Let the watchwords of all our people be the old familiar watchwords of honesty , decency , fair-dealing , and commonsense . '' ... `` We must treat each man on his worth and merits as a man . We must see that each is given a square deal , because he is entitled to no more and should receive no less . '' ... `` The welfare of each of us is dependent fundamentally upon the welfare of all of us . '' —Roosevelt , New York State Fair , Syracuse , New York , September 7 , 1903 . The idea behind the Square Deal was to be fair to every citizen in the United States . To create this fairness , corporations and the average citizen had to be equal . To achieve this equality , President Roosevelt created a series of laws and programs aimed at rebalancing the balance of power between labor , consumer , and safety interests against business , manufacturers and profit.To ensure market competition , President Roosevelt built into the Square Deal program the concepts that monopolies were wrong and that business should not cut corners to the point where public health is jeopordized . When consumer buying power has no means to induce change via market competition , chances are the corporation would cut costs or corners to achieve a higher profit via deceptive practices , poor quality control , or polluting methods , at the expense of the consumers health or lives.So a square deal had to be instituted to ensure that business cost cutting measures have a limit . To achieve this goal , extreme cost cutting measures , wanton corruption and instability had to be brought under contol . Railroads were no longer allowed to give rebates or kickbacks to favored companies . Meat had to be processed safely with proper santitation , and people were allowed to breathe the fresh air of national parks . Foods and drugs could no longer be mislabeled , nor could consumers be delierately misled to make a profit . Businesses were forced to accept the additional cost of these reforms as a part of the their cost of doing business .",0

"Can a state to state relationship turn in to a life long relationship together. ? Yes , it can . It depends on how hard you work at it , and how much they are working at it . You have to keep your commitments of calling when you promise , being on line when you promise , of coming down when you promise , and vice versa . Sometimes starting out in long distance relationships actually make them better . One reason is that you know from the beginning it is going to take work and are ready to take that on . Second , you learn to communicate verbally with each other on every topic , and that will last through your relationship if it leads to marriage . Also , it forces you to take things slow , and really get to know the person over time . Sometimes if we can see the person every day , we fall too fast , and fail to recognize the warning signs that we would see if there were some distance put between us . I know of a couple that dated from Scotland to Canada for two years , and just got married . You know what ? They would n't have traded the past two years for anything , because now they talk to each other every day about everything , and it has taught them a lot about confiding in each other and trusting in each other .

"Why is alcohol legal ? In the UK the number of alcohol related deaths soars past 20 , 000 per year , and in the USA , the figure is more than double that . It was once illegal in the US , during a period known as prohibition . However , while alcohol use dipped initially , prohibition 's negative effects outweighed the positive ones . One problem is that despite the fact that alcohol was illegal , it was easy to make and import alcohol from outside the US . As well , prohibition did a great deal to contribute to organized crime , which profited of sales of alcohol . Since alcohol consumption was and is still well established in American and British culture , the demand is such that underground organizations would thrive . As such , we would see an increase in crime and probably not a tremendous fall in alcohol-related crime.To add to that , the alcohol-making industry has much more resources than the prohibitionist movement and thus prohibition is also less politically viable for financial reasons.For more info on prohibition , check out the Wikipedia article below .",0

"What the meaning of `` CALIFORNIA `` ? In the greek language `` CALI `` means `` NICE `` Some suggest that the word California may signify that a place is `` hot as an oven '' ( cali > hot , fornia > oven ) . It may be derived from caliente fornalia , Spanish for hot furnace , or it may come from calida fornax , Latin for hot climate.Another possible source may be kali forno , an indigenous phrase meaning `` high mountains '' . There is no agreement among scholars.The name California comes from a mythical Spanish island ruled by a queen called Califia that was featured in a Spanish romance ( `` Las Sergas de Esplandian '' ) written by Garcia Ordonez de Montalvo in 1510 . The Spanish explorers originally thought that California was an island .",0

"What are some good ways to stop smoking cigarettes. ? Methods of quittingCold Turkey methodNicotine Replacement Methods ( Patch , Gum , Nasal Spray ) Behavioral MethodsCognitive Therapy MethodOther Methods and adjuncts ( acupuncture , hypnosis , medications ) Factors for relapse while in the process of quittingPredictors of successful quittingCold turkey methodThis is the prefered method used by so called self changers , people who quit on their own and without any nicotine replacement by gum , patch or nasal spray . Little is known about this method as any research study would influence the results as it would no longer be a spontaneous process . Strong motivational factors are believed to play the foremost role in successful quitting using this method.Nicotine replacement therapyIn this method the nicotine delivered by the cigarette is replaced with nicotine delivered through the skin ( transdermal nicotine or nicotine patch ) , the nasal mucosa ( nicotine nasal spray ) or the buccal mucosa ( nicotine chewing gum ) . Several well designed clinical trials have shown the efficacy and safety of nicotine replacement the goal of which is to reduce cravings and ease withdrawal symptoms . Transdermal Nicotine Patches The nicotine patch is usually well tolerated , and provides constant , steady nicotine blood levels throughout the day and night when worn . They are quite simple to use , help prevent weight gain , cravings , and nicotine withdrawal symptoms and are socially acceptable Side Effects of the patch Patches may cause a local skin reaction , and insomnia with nightmares may occur . Overdosing in nicotine is possible , especially if a person smokes while wearing the patch . Smoking while wearing a patch is dangerous and may lead to stroke or heart attack . Use of the patch requires abstinence from tobacco products ... i.e . no smoking or chewing tobacco . Cost Patches are expensive and cost close to $ 100 per month of use . However bear in mind that smoking 1 ppd costs $ 1000 per year , which multipied by 10 years approximates the price of a car . Some people are tempted to cut the patch to save money . Nicoderm is the only patch that can be cut without destroying the patch 's ability to deliver nicotine through the skin to the bloodstream reliably.. It is not unsafe to cut the other patches as far as I know . However cutting the other patches impairs the transdermal drug delivery system , and may not provide reliable blood levels of nicotine . the key word here is reliable . The total dose of nicotine in the patch does not correlate at a milligram to milligram equivalency to the dose delivered to the bloodstream . The drug delivery system of the patch ensures that nicotine is transported thru the skin at a constant rate , and e ach manufacturer uses a different patented technology to do this . Only a portion of the total nicotine contained in the patch is transported thru the skin . Individual differences in skin thickness , location of the applied patch , and other related factors play a role in the total dose delivered . 3 Step Tapering Method of using the patch o The 21 mg patch is worn daily for 6-8 weeks for quitters who smoked an average of 1 ppd ( 2 ppd quitters may require 2 patches to alleviate cravings and withdrawal symptoms ) o The 14 mg patch is then worn daily for the next 2 to 4 weeks if the ex smoker remains confident in his or her ability to not smoke and if urges or cravings to smoke are controlled . o The 7 mg patch is then worn for 2-4 weeks if the same criteria as above are met . o In the absence of cravings and urge to smoke the patch is then stopped entirely . It is important to individualize the tapering method . . . Some people require longer periods of use , others shorter . If cravings intensify , return to the next higher dose of the patch . Types of nicotine patches Nicotrol 15,10,5 mg 16 hour patches",0

"how can i help others who have lost loved ones recentlyas people have helped me online ? 1 lost my 60 yr old sister in sept and 4mo greatgrandson in dec and 32 yr old daughter in jan.people here have helped me to get on with life and that i will not know why this has happened till i see god.i go to church and that has helped.i pray to god several times a day.i am raising my daughter 's 10 yr old daughter and know i have to go on for her.i have a husband and 4 sons 8 other grandchildren.i know all this that has happened will take time to get through which is not easy and that i will never forget.we go to counseling which has helped.just thought i could help someone like others have helped me and still do . That is so awful . They say you always lose people in 3 's . Anyway , it is important for me to tell you this ... Before we all came to this place we had a plan already written . In that plan we have 5 ways we can chose to leave this earth to go to the other side . You sister was needed by God at that time . She left to help God . You great-grandson was never meant to come to earth yet , so God took him back until it was the right time . Our world just was n't ready for the great being he will now be in another life . Your daughter had to go to the other side because it was in your life plan to take care of your granddaughter . I know this all sounds really freaky but believe me ... you are doing a great job holding it together . You should n't be worried about helping other people especially on Yahoo ! Answers , because your family is going through thier own grieving process and they need you . You are their rock . This is your plan .",0

"do other premenopausal women have incredibly painful high-flow periods after skipping two or three months ? Consider this ... It 's possible that your `` high-flow periods '' are not actual periods at all , but just your body becoming unable to hold all the blood that has collected in the uterus due to not having a period for two to three months . The body `` releases '' the blood , and then goes back to not having `` periods '' until there is again too much blood to hold . This is one of the experiences caused by an endocrine disorder called PCOS ( polycystic ovarian syndrome ) that can cause erratic or skipped periods , and can cause exactly the painful high-flow `` periods '' of which you speak . You should visit an endocrinologist and have the doctor check your hormone levels to make sure that everything is normal . PCOS can be treated with medication and diet . There are other symptoms to the disorder as well , and if left untreated , the disorder can cause long term health problems such as diabetes or heart disease .",0

"Why does like charges repel each other ? This is a very good question . Ultimately it comes down to being one of the fundamental features of our universe . But it can also be broken down a bit.Like charges repel , and opposite ones attract because of differences in their electric fields . But the electric fields are really part of the larger electromagnetic force . This force is mediated by photons ( light ) and , indeed light is a self-propagating electromagnetic wave.But there are also three other fundamental forces : gravity , the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force . The strong nuclear force is well , strong , but very short range . It holds the protons and neutrons together in a nucleus ( otherwise the like charges from the protons would break up every nucleus except hydrogen ) . The weak nuclear force is sort of a miscellaneous , and comes into play in certain radioactive decay sequences.In the 1980s it was shown that the electromagnetic and weak forces are actually the same thing . The difference we observe is that the universe is , relatively speaking , `` cold , '' and these two parts have separated out . It is sort of like having a glass of steam ( one thing ) which cools down until there is water and ice ( two things ) . The water and ice look a lot different from each other , but are fundamentally the same . In the same way in the very , very early universe when things were a lot hotter , the electromagnetic and weak forces were identical - like the steam in the analogy.More recently it was found that the strong force can also be linked to the `` electroweak '' force in the same sort of manner . The mathematical and physical details are different from `` electroweak unification '' but the basic principle is the same . It was from this Grand Unification of the electromagnetic , weak , and strong forces the the theoretical notion of quarks came . This GUT has been tested and the experiments show it is right on target.The next step is to connect the electro-weak-strong force with gravity . This is a lot harder because the first three are understood in the context of Quantum Mechanics and gravity is understood with General Relativity . QM and GR are not compatible on some basic principles.One approach that is being tried to combine QM and GR is with string theory . To make this work the universe is composed of 11 dimensions , the usual 3-spatial and 1-temporal dimentsion , plus 7 very , very small spatial dimensions . If these extra 7 are looped around themselves so that they are vastly `` smaller '' than a proton , we 'd never really notice them.What string theory seems to suggest is that there are just some ways to make stuff in the universe , and one of these ways is to create the `` force particles '' that mediate the fundamental forces.So , extrapolating that , and realizing that string theory is in no sense proven , we can say that `` like charges repel '' because of the geometry ( the 11-dimensions ) of the universe.But string theory remains far from being complete mathematically , and no one can really make solid predictions yet to test it . So , you can also fall back on the answer in the first paragraph .",0

"Does Koran recognize Jews ’ ‘ Deed of Ownership ’ regarding Palestine as the Promised Land ? `` That land , the Promised Land , was given by God to the Jews in the Bible , which is our Deed of Ownership , an ownership recognized in the Kuran itself ! `` I asked a question 2 hours ago . Although not being an answer to my question , got an interesting answer including the sentence above . For details , please see that answer . http : //answers.yahoo.com/question/ ; _ylt=Am9iPSwhQW.CBlEttT2gKzwjzKIX ? qid=1006021203731 Koran recognizes Jews and their prophet , Mosa as well as Christians and their prophet Jesus . Koran also recognizes that Jerusalem is the Holy Land of Jews . But this ca n't interpreted as a deed of ownership . Jews always try to distort it by purpose in order to make Moslims to serve them for the establishment of Big Israel State between two rivers , exactly like how they convince Christians that it is a Christian duty to support Jews cause they are chosen , etc.Moslims are not taught to be hate Jews . Moslims respect them and the fact that Jerusalem is their Holy Land . Their greedy unrealistic Big Israel Utopia which is covering whole Middle East and their violance in Palestine make Moslims hate them . See , we respect them , their Holy Land , but as usual , it is not enough , they ask for the deed of ownership . [ 62-6,7,8 ] : Say ( O Muhammad ) : O ye who are Jews , if ye claim that ye are the favoured of Allah apart from ( all ) mankind , then long for death if you are truthful . But they will never long for it because of all that their own hands have sent before , and Allah is Aware of evil-doers .

"Can i adddepreciation expense in cashflow even Der is no accumulated depreciation in balnce sheet.will it blan I am having a problem in forecasting a financial statement about adding a depreciation expense in cashflow even though there is no accumulated depreciaiton in the balance sheet under fixed asset it will not balance on the actual amount , on the other hand if I did n't include the depreeciaiton in cashflow the balance sheet will balance . Can you help me on this ? Depreciation is added into every cash flow statement that I have ever seen where a company has fixed depreciable assets . Since it reduces net income but does not currently rely on the use of cash , you add it back . The purchase of the asset would be handled seperately as a use of cash .

"can i have a child if i have crohns and what are the risk ? can i have achid if I have crohns and what are the risk ? Most women with Crohn 's disease are able to deliver healthy , full-term babies ; however , many people have questions about the impact Crohn 's disease will have on a pregnancy . Women who have Crohn 's disease may be concerned about whether or not they have the physical capacity to carry a pregnancy to term , while men with Crohn 's disease may worry whether medication has affected the viability of their sperm.Will we be able to conceive a baby ? Women with an active case of Crohn 's disease may have difficulty conceiving . Men who use sulfasalazine , a commonly used drug to treat Crohn 's disease , may become temporarily infertile because the sulfa compound can decrease sperm production . If a man is trying to father a child , he should ask his physician about 5-ASA medications which can treat Crohn 's disease without risking fertility . Women with Crohn ’ s disease who are planning to become pregnant should consult a doctor.How can Crohn 's disease affect my pregnancy ? While most women with Crohn 's disease are able to carry a full-term pregnancy and deliver a healthy baby , it is important for you to know that your disease may affect your pregnancy in the following ways : A cesarean section may be required for some women who have Crohn 's disease with complications , including abscesses or fistulas of the rectum or vagina.If a woman is experiencing an active bout of Crohn 's disease during pregnancy she has a 2 to 3 times increased risk of miscarriage , delivering the baby prematurely , or stillbirth.If a woman has active Crohn 's disease at the time of conception , the disease usually runs its course in a similar way to the pattern that was experienced before pregnancy.If a woman is experiencing active Crohn 's disease prior to a pregnancy , she may notice that the symptoms of her disease worsen right after becoming pregnant and during the first 3 months of the pregnancy . The disease may also intensify right after the delivery of her baby . It 's important to remember that every pregnancy is different . There is no evidence showing that if you experience severe symptoms during your pregnancy , subsequent pregnancies will also be difficult.Should I change my diet now that I am pregnant ? It is important for all pregnant women to eat a healthy and well-balanced diet . As a woman with Crohn 's disease , in addition to eating a standard diet recommended during pregnancy , your obstetrician and gastroenterologist may also recommend some special foods , vitamins , and minerals . If your Crohn 's disease is being treated with sulfasalazine , it is important that your diet be supplemented with folic acid , since this is an essential nutrient in preventing certain birth defects.Are medications for Crohn 's disease safe to take during my pregnancy ? All women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant should avoid taking any unnecessary medications . However , if you are experiencing active Crohn 's disease , it may be necessary for you to be treated with medication.If you ’ re a pregnant woman and considering drug therapy , you should speak with both your gastroenterologist and your obstetrician , so that each healthcare provider is well informed about current health issues when recommending treatment options.Are any diagnostic tests safe during pregnancy ? All pregnant women should avoid having X-rays , especially during the first 12 weeks , unless it is absolutely necessary . Presently , MRIs are sometimes used , but more information is needed . The following tests may also be used for pregnant women who may have Crohn 's disease for the management of their disease : Abdominal ultrasoundSigmoidoscopyRectal biopsyUpper endoscopyColonoscopyWill previous surgery for Crohn 's disease affect my pregnancy ?

"What is the wicca religon ? I have always wondered . Wicca is a Neopagan religious movement found in many different countries , though most commonly in English-speaking cultures . Wicca was first publicised in 1954 after the repeal of the British Witchcraft Act , by a British civil servant named Gerald Gardner . He claimed that the religion , of which he was an initiate , was a modern survival of an old witch cult , which had existed in secret for hundreds of years , originating in the pre-Christian Paganism of Europe . Wicca is thus sometimes referred to as the Old Religion . The veracity of Gardner 's claims is now much debated , and it is thought that much if not all of Wiccan theology was established no earlier than the 1920s . Since its founding , various related Wiccan traditions have evolved , or been adapted from , the form established by Gardner , which came to be called Gardnerian Wicca . These other traditions of Wicca each have specific beliefs , rituals , and practices . Most traditions of Wicca remain secretive and require members to be initiated , however there is a growing movement of Eclectic or Solitary Wiccans who adhere to the religion but do not believe a traditional initiation is necessary . Gardnerian Wicca is perhaps the most popular of the traditions excepting Solitary Wicca . you can find more information also in the address that i give you",0
"How is Holi celebrated in India ? Holi marks the beginning of the spring season and the end of the frosty winters .

It heralds the end of the winter and the beginning of the spring and marks the rekindling of the spirit of life . It is a festival of joy when all is forgiven and it is a time to break free.The night before full moon , crowds of people gather together and light huge bonfires to burn the residual dried leaves and twigs of the winter .

"what is meant by `` heat balance '' in steam boilers ? with reference to the second year mech . engineering thermodynamics 2 syllabus Heat balance is a mathematical way of summing all the heat inputs and outputs to zero . Just as in statics , all the forces on a point must sum to zero if it is stationary . For a boiler , there is heat going into it , the heat of the burner exhaust going out , the thermal loss from all the piping and external surfaces heating the local atmosphere , the heat leaving the boiler by the mass flow rate of steam , and the entropy of the hot water under pressure inside the boiler . Sorry this is wordy , but I ca n't write an equation for you in this window . Heat is usually referenced by Q , so look for 0=Q1+Q2+ ... . blaa blaa blaa .",0

"Is something wrong with YAHOO Fantasy sports ? ? I am not sure what exactly you mean . If you mean technical problems ? well sometimes the log in page doesn ' load and I have to refresh the page a few times . That seems to be a Yahoo problem in generalif you mean the game itself , it is generally good but I would suggest some improvements.1- the number one improvement that is absolutely necessary is the IR/IL lists . Sometimes other website report that certain players , eg . Ed Jovonavski or Amare Stoudomire have been put on the IR . Yahoo however , does n't follow suit immidiately , they are a few days late . They have to keep in mind that those few days are very important for some of us . 2- KEPPER LEAGUE OPTION : I play Keeper leagues , meaning that I have inherited a team and its minor league system ( in case of hockey ) . I get to trade draft picks , prospects and active players . I think it would be better if Yahoo had a keeper league option . a ) That way we would n't have to set up a new league every season . b ) I 'd also suggest that they have a minor league section as part of this keeper league option . We could then keep our prospects who are not yet part of the NHL on our minor league roster . That way no other GM accidentally picks these guys up and also we wo n't forget about one of our many prospects . c ) When trades occure , they need to announce to the other GM 's all parts of the trade . As you know , when you trade in Yahoo leagues , it also gives the GM an comment box in which people that play keeper leagues put names of prospects or draft picks . As it 's currently set , these comments do n't appear to the other GM 's when the trade is accepted . For us the active players that are exchanged is one thing , most of the time it 's the draft picks and prospects that are the real deal makers . Right now GMs have to post extra comments letting everyone else know of the trade . IMO that needs to change.that 's it for now till I think of other things .",0

Not so fond of Washington politics , he resigned from the Senate in 1842 and returned to New Hampshire to practice law . He turned down political offers to serve in the Mexican War , and was eventually made a Brigadier General . In 1852 he attended the Democratic national convention and , much to his surprise , won the nomination and the election . He tried unsuccessfully to promote conciliation between the North and the South and served only one term , losing in 1856 to James Buchanan .",0
"What is the temperature of an absolute vacuum ? No one can give me a good answer to this . i never really thought about it and so i was just going to say that temperature doesnt matter because its a vacuum and is dealing with the pressure ... but when i thought about it ... come to think of it , i do have an answer for you . the temperature would be zero kelvin , absolute zero . in an absolute vacuum , the pressure would be 0 if there were no particles , because the more particles you cram into one place , the more pressure there is because p=F/A pressure equals the force of the particles divided by the area of the wall of the container , so with no force of particles ( since there are no partiles ) , the pressure would be zero . in an absolute vacuum , there are no particles . Now , if the pressure is zero , then according to the formula PV=nRT ( which is just the ideal gas law formula , ) if P ( pressure ) equals 0 , i think that means that T ( temperature in Kelvin ) would also be 0 which would mean that the temperature would be at absolute zero ( which is defined as the temperature where all matter stops moving.. not that this would make a difference because there are no particles there because it 's an absolute vacuum . This is what i suspect and to confirm my beliefs , it is consistent with the fact that someone else said that outer space was 3K , and although it 's very close to an absolute vacuum , there are a few particles and atoms of gas floating around there , and so it is not quite an absolute vacuum , and the temperature is 3K , meaning it 's not quite at absolute zero . so it stands to reason that since temperature decreases when pressure decreases , that in an absolute vacuum the temperature would be absolute zero , 0 kelvin.i hope this is a `` good answer '' and that i made sense while i took you through my reasoning : )",0
"Where can I learn all about the basics of credit cards ? i know almost nothing about them except that you use them to pay for things . i want to know first the basics , and then strategies to avoid having bad credit ( i dont have any credit yet ) . I 've been searching all over , but the websites i find are always using terms and acronyms that i 'm not sure i know the meaning of . can someone help me out ? I agree with VaTreasures - the best thing you can do when using a credit card is to discipline yourself to pay off your balance on time . If you get into a habit of not paying on time you start to acrue more and more interest fees ( I know all about it ) . Paying back on time will also avoid any missed payment penalties.Apply for a credit card with an interest free period , this will cut down on costs . Getting an interest free period is important.If you are unhappy with the idea of running a credit account , then I would recommend a prepaid card or direct debit card . Prepaid cards can be loaded with funds so you can not overspend , which keeps your finances in good shape . Debit cards withdraw funds from your bank account instantly when you make a purchase , again these do not require managing a credit account and help discipline your spending.More helpful tips from round the web :",0

"will the usa ever win the soccer world cup ? I believe the USA can win the World Cup this year . Noone is writing us off this time around . We are ranked in the top 10 by FIFA . To go along with our ranking , we have some of the best goalkeeping in the world ( Keller , Howard , and a number of MLS keepers like Reis and Hartman ) . We have a solid defense with Bocanegra , Onyewu , Hejduk , and Pope ( and maybe even Pablo Mastroeni ) . World-class midfielders in Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley will be stepping onto the pitch ( not to mention the solid job players like Kerry Zavagnin put forth each and every time they take the field ) . Up top , we have the emergence of Taylor Twellman in the international game and the return of Eddie Johnson to the fold . We have a coach in Bruce Arena who , I believe , if he leaves after the tournament , should get a top-flight European league job next fall ( Malcolm Glazer hiring Bruce Arena at ManU if Sir Alex Ferguson were to leave ? A long shot maybe , but intriguing. ) . Add to that , one of Italy 's best players , Francesco Totti , recently went down with a serious injury and will be out until at least May . Even if he does come back for the tournament , will he be at full strength ? Ghana 's midfielder Laryea Kingston will also miss the tournament through suspension . While we have a tough road to travel both in our group and with the possibility of Brazil lurking in the round of 16 , I believe the USA has the ability to take on the world 's best and win it all .",0

"Allows you to minimize , maximize , and restore windows ? You can use the three buttons in the upper right corner of the screen on a Windows machine - not sure about Linux or Mac . The `` X '' ( red on WinXP and some flavors of Linux ) closes the window . To Maximize , click the middle button ( the `` square '' ) and to minimize , click the `` _ '' looking window.Optionally , you can click the icon on the LEFT top of the screen , select either Minimize , Maximize , and Restore ( among other functions . ) Another tip to restore and maximize windows is to double-click the top window bar ( that 's the upper edge of the window . ) OR , you can right-click on the minimized icon in your systems tray / start toolbar ( usually on the bottom of your secreen ) and select which function you 'd like to perform on that window ( Minimize , Maximize , Restore ... ) again , among others.Alternately , you can use the task manager ( right click on the start bar [ usually ] on the bottom of the screen , and click Windows for functions which will affect all windows . ) Finally , you can cheat , using your keyboard - to do the following commands : Alt-Space , n = MinimizeAlt-Space , x = MaximizeandAlt-Space , r = Restore.I hope that answers your question - Good luck !",0

"What 's the best diet to loose weith in 1 month ? ? i need to loose some weith ! Any minding of the fat & calories , coupled with adequate exercise , will help you drop a little something.Increase your activity . Start walking , jogging , or biking for 30-60 minutes at least 3 or 4 times a week.Drink like a camel . I try to drink about 15 glasses of water a day , plus coffee ( the extra water is to counter the caffeine dehydration ) .Use a calorie-free sweetener instead of sugar . Try to be active in the morning , and try to eat breakfast . Both will kick-start your metabolism.Get adequate sleep.If you 're a carb addict like me ( bread , pasta , etc . ) , opt for whole grains . I eat whole grain cheerios for breakfast , and use 1 % milk . 1-3 times a day , I eat buttered vegetables ( California or Italian Style frozen vegetable mix from Wal-Mart : 25 calories per serving ) .If you like kool-aid or other sweet drinks , try fruit2o ( fruity water ) , Propel ( fruity water by gatorade ) , or CRYSTAL LIGHT drink mixes . I once traded in my kool-aid for crystal light while I was pregnant , and did n't gain any weight between visits with my doctor.If you want a little help , go invest in a good OTC diet pill like TrimSPA or Propolene . I do n't recommend Stackers , but that 's only because I do n't know many people who can take stimulants the way I do . DO NOT take more than the recommended dosage , and do n't take them too late in the day , or you wo n't sleep.And last ... COMMIT to changing your lifestyle , NOT just dropping a few pounds for whatever happens in a month , and thinking it 's going to be forever . If you can not commit , then do not complain .",0

"why is the child support system not more fair to the fathers who are in their child ` s life ? What cheermom stated demonstrates that there are similarities between California and Iowa . The point to keep in mind is that the Child Support Systems are usually divided into multiple sections . For those who work with individuals involved in the various cases , those who look out for the interests of the children , those are involved in the getting payments form the State to the primary care giver of the child , and those who collect money owed by a parent of record who is mandated by the court to make payments . These departments must follow the orders of the court . That is , a parent who is working to be involved in the life of the child is a great thing , but if they are not paying their court ordered child support payments , these departments have no choice but to act for the court and collect the funds from the delinquent parent . If a parent disagrees with the amount owed ( for whatever reason ) , their argument is not with the State departments but with the court and they must go back to the court to have a new order issued.Here in Iowa they will go after the delinquent parent irregardless of their job position and this includes working with other States . Only the court can change this reality.I realize that it can be frustrating , but the parents are best served if they do not try to mix things such as visitations and child support payments , the courts view them as two different actions .",0

"what is prolactaine ? no spasm Prolactin is a hormone synthesised and secreted by lactotrope cells in the adenohypophysis ( anterior pituitary gland ) . Prolactin is made up of 199 amino acids , and has a molecular weight of about 23,000 daltons . Prolactin has many effects , the most significant of which is to stimulate the mammary glands to produce milk ( lactation ) .Increased serum prolactin during pregnancy causes enlargement of the mammary glands of the breasts and increases the production of milk . However , the high levels of estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy acts directly on the breasts to stop ejection of milk . It is only when the levels of these hormones fall after child birth that milk ejection is possible.Sometimes , newborn babies ( males as well as females ) secrete a milky substance from their nipples . This substance is called Witch 's milk . This is caused by the fetus ' being affected by prolactin circulating in the mother just before birth , and usually stops soon after birth",0

"More Question to Muslim ? I am sorry this is just for My Knowladge.I do n't mean to provoke anything.Thank for a good answer.==========================What is women in Islam think about poligamy . I made some studies in Modern Muslim country it look like they do n't like poligamy.At what age Muhammad married Aishah ( Hope I am writting correctly ) and how many wife he have ? ? Why and what is the reason behind that . Dear SellCar , i really hope you got a good reason behind those questions , anyways ill answer your question.i read some strange answer above ; ( , so i hope i can make it clear Ofcourse every woman hates polygamy , God created woman to hate anyone that shares her love , but in Holy Quran it says and made it clear for men that they should not take more than one wife unless they have their reasons , like for example some wives dont have the ability to be pregnant , its no body 's fault of course but as a man everyone likes to be a father , therefore he can marry another wife.another reason for men might be that some men need more than one woman and he is not getting enough , therefore he could make sin with other woman which is bad for Islam teachings and social life and reputation , or he can marry another woman that will give him more pleasure and in the same time he is not making any sin.Moreover , if you now make a study you will find that number of men is much more less than number of women in the world , years ago in Germany they where surprised to find that 1 man is being borned for every 4 women ! ! for a reason that no one knows except God he knew that this will be the case , therefore he authorised to have more than wife , or else we will have more than half of the woman not married for the rest of their lives . ( speaking about Islam societies only , western countires men and woman stays with no marriage usually for the rest of their lives ) God authorised polygamy for more better reasons ofcourse , but i only know these.and of course there is no polygamy for men in Islam ; ) , because at that stage we cant know who is son or daughter of whom.and for a man being with a legal woman is ofcourse much better than being with a new woman everyday or month ; ( Islam makes a great social life by its teachings.============i really dont know the exact age of Muhammad ( PBUH ) when he married Aisha , but i think in 40's.God didnt authorise for muslims to marry more than four wives and in a certain conditions , but for messenger of God ( Muhmmad PBUH ) he authorised for him to marry more , i do know one reason now for this is that Mohammad ( PBUH ) wanted to make links with the arab tribes across arabia to spread Islam , and as a messenger of God marrying one of the women in a tribe it was a very good impression to make for those tribes , which later he made friendship with them and they followed Islam teachings , therefore marrying more than one wife helped the spread of Islam at that time , and it made for Islam a good base in Arabia .",0

"why did terry bradshaw not appear with the mvp 's in the super bowl ? When the NFL unveiled its MVPs from the previous 39 Super Bowls , only three living members skipped the ceremony.Former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana and former Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw decided to stay home , while former Dolphins MVP Jake Scott was traveling in Australia.Montana , the league 's only three-time Super Bowl MVP , and Bradshaw reportedly turned down the invitation over money.Both denied the reports.In a phone interview with ESPN2 's Cold Pizza on Monday night , Montana vehemently denied forgoing the ceremony over money and reiterated that his absence was due to his preference to see his son 's basketball game.He 'd told Cold Pizza last week he was n't going to be at the game because his son had an important basketball game he wanted to attend . Bradshaw , according to the Chronicle , told league officials he wanted to be with his family.Montana said money was never an issue and that he would not have attended the Super Bowl ceremony even if the appearance fee had been greater than the $ 100,000 he was reported to have requested.Former MVPs were given $ 1,000 for incidental expenses while in Detroit , along with other amenities such as plane tickets , car rental and game tickets.Sources told each paper that Montana asked for a guarantee of at least $ 100,000 in appearance money.When the league balked at Montana 's demands , the quarterback declined to be in attendance .",0

"Why is The ocean salty ? [ be specific ] ? All water , even rain water , contains dissolved chemicals which scientists call `` salts . '' But not all water tastes salty . Water is fresh or salty according to individual judgment , and in making this decision man is more convinced by his sense of taste than by a laboratory test . It is one 's taste buds that accept one water and reject another.A simple experiment illustrates this . Fill three glasses with water from the kitchen faucet . Drink from one and it tastes fresh even though some dissolved salts are naturally present . Add a pinch of table salt to the second , and the water may taste fresh or slightly salty depending on a personal taste threshold and on the amount of salt held in a `` pinch . '' But add a teaspoon of salt to the third and your taste buds vehemently protest that this water is too salty to drink ; this glass of water has about the same salt content as a glass of sea water.Obviously , the ocean , in contrast to the water we use daily , contains unacceptable amounts of dissolved chemicals ; it is too salty for human consumption . HOW SALTY IS THE OCEAN ? ... How salty the ocean is , however , defies ordinary comprehension . Some scientists estimate that the oceans contain as much as 50 quadrillion tons ( 50 million billion tons ) of dissolved solids.If the salt in the sea could be removed and spread evenly over the Earth 's land surface it would form a layer more than 500 feet thick , about the height of a 40-story office building . The saltiness of the ocean is more understandable when compared with the salt content of a fresh-water lake . For example , when 1 cubic foot of sea water evaporates it yields about 2.2 pounds of salt , but 1 cubic foot of fresh water from Lake Michigan contains only one one-hundredth ( 0.01 ) of a pound of salt , or about one sixth of an ounce . Thus , sea water is 220 times saltier than the fresh lake water . What arouses the scientist 's curiosity is not so much why the ocean is salty , but why it is n't fresh like the rivers and streams that empty into it . Further , what is the origin of the sea and of its `` salts '' ? And how does one explain ocean water 's remarkably uniform chemical composition ? To these and related questions , scientists seek answers with full awareness that little about the oceans is understood.Illustration : Sources of salts in the ocean.THE ORIGIN OF THE SEA ... In popular language , `` ocean '' and `` sea '' are used interchangeably . Today 's seas are the North and South Pacific , North and South Atlantic , Indian and Arctic Oceans and the Antarctic waters or seas.Scientists believe that the seas are as much as 500 million years old because animals that lived then occur as fossils in rocks which once were under ancient seas . There are several theories about the origin of the seas , but no single theory explains all aspects of this puzzle . Many earth scientists agree with the hypothesis that both the atmosphere and the oceans have accumulated gradually through geologic time from some process of `` degassing '' of the Earth 's interior . According to this theory , the ocean had its origin from the prolonged escape of water vapor and other gases from the molten igneous rocks of the Earth to the clouds surrounding the cooling Earth . After the Earth 's surface had cooled to a temperature below the boiling point of water , rain began to fall and continued to fall for centuries . As the water drained into the great hollows in the Earth 's surface , the primeval ocean came into existence . The forces of gravity prevented the water from leaving the planet.SOURCES OF THE SALTS ... Sea water has been defined as a weak solution of almost everything . Ocean water is indeed a complex solution of mineral salts and of decayed biologic matter that results from the teeming life in the seas . Most of the ocean 's salts were derived from gradual processes such the breaking up of the cooled igneous rocks of the Earth & # 39",0

"Has anybody had annemia from hepatitis c treatment , please relate ? I have not personally been treated with Pegylated IFN and Ribavirin , but anemia is common with Ribavirin treatment . It is the leading reason Ribavirin doses are decreased during treatment for Hepatitis C. Hopefully you doctor is comfortable using Epogen or Procrit to allow you to maintain the highest possible dose of Ribavirin during your therapy . Using `` growth factors '' or agents such as Epogen ( or `` epo '' ) or Procrit to boost red blood cells and keeping the dose of Ribavirin as high as possible will increase the liklihood of clearing the virus and achieving an SVR.Best wishes and good luck !",0
"Why does the heavy part of a class ring spin on top when the ring is spun but stationary moves to the bottom. ? When a child 's top is spun , the point is down and the heavy part up while spinning but when it slows down it topples over , the same happens to a class ring when spun . Why ? The rotational energy you impart to the object when spinning overcomes the force of gravity that would topple a stationary object . A total layman 's explanation : A perfect stationary top perfectly balanced will not fall over . In real life though , it 's impossible to perfectly balance a top . It 's shape practically guarantees that its center of gravity will not be directly over the balance point for any practical length of time . Imperfections in the material will cause a slightly uneven weight distribution , air currents will introduce a small force , and mechanical vibrations will be transmitted through the medium the top rests on . The upshot of all this is that as soon as the center of mass is no longer over the resting point , gravity is going to pull the top over . Now gravity has an acceleration of 32 feet per second squared ( if I remember my ancient high school course correctly ) . It can only topple the top at a specific speed . If you spin the top fast enough , any side that gravity tries to `` pull down '' will translate around so quickly that it literally has no time to fall . If you were standing on a planet with a much higher gravity , you 'd have to spin the top far faster to achieve stability , and if you were on the moon , it would spin for a much longer time . Eventually , however , the top starts to slow and the tip will inscribe little circles . That action is called `` precession '' . And of course , eventually the thing drops to the table and the game is all up once it slows enough.Again , that 's a layman 's view of how it works . Some college physics major is probably going to come in here and make my answer look really foolish .",0

Quadrilateral ABCD formatted like this : A DB CGiven : < A is congruent to < C < B is congruent to < DProve : ABCD is a parallelogramHow do I do this ? Thanks in advance . this is difficult to do without drawing . but here 's the gist of it.1 . < a + < b + < c + < d = 360 ( definition of quadrilateral ) 2 . < a + < b + < a + < b = 360 ( since a = c and b = d ) 3 . 2 ( a + b ) = 3604. a + b = 1805 . < a and < b are supplementary anglesnow extend the line AB and include a new point X , so you have a picture that looks like : XA DB C < XAD and < BAD are supplementary since XAB is a lineabove we proved that < ABC and < BAD are also supplementaryso < XAD + < BAD = 180and < ABC + < BAD = 180which means < XAD = < ABCso now we can conclude that AD || BCbecause the corresponding angles < XAD and < ABC are congruent.you can use this same logic to show that AB || DChope this makes sense..",0

Each kua number has 8 directions , we all have 4 good directions and 4 bad directions . Also the date of building is very important , that way one can know in which period the house is being built or was built , right now we find ourselves in period 8 ! Let 's say U want to built a house and your very best first direction is North , then U will orientand design your home plans according to these directions . A total Feng Shui house can be design by this Kua number and also with the help of different formulas e.g Land Scape Feng Shui,8 Mansions , Flying Star , Etc.Plan the layout of a house by identifying the good sectors and not so good sectors after examining the flying star natal chart of a house . Identify if there are any specials such as parent string combinations in your flying star chart , and plant to augment their good luck by incorporating an open-spaced concept within your house . Then work with shapes when activating the feng shui of the different sectors of your house.Actually Feng Shui is becoming more and more popular with the years and many architects are already working together with Feng Shui Consultants to design floor plans of a house , building or residential complex !

"What would we have to do to end Daylight Savings Time ? Changing the clocks twice a year messes with our productivity . People are late to work , people are sleepy etc .

You may want to take your direction from the `` End Daylight Savings Time '' campaign ( see link to web site below ) .Unfortunately , things appear to be moving in the other direction as an amendment to an energy bill passed by Congress in Aug. 2005 , Daylight Saving time will be extended by about a month . Beginning in 2007 , Daylight Saving Time will begin on the second Sunday in March and end on the first Sunday in November.The sad reality is that both sides in this argument have mired it down with exageration and statistics which can not be verified .

"I need to know the physics behind a helicopter 's flight. ? I need to know how a helicopter flies ( with equations , if possible ) and the possible problems a helicopter may experience in-flight . Thanks . Well , the physics of a helicopter is a very complex subject , but in essence it is only the blades of the helicopter pushing air down on the ground to lift it . The reason it starts to become complex is because the weight of the helicopter is thrown into the equation and the blades of it work in circular motion . The helicopter does have a coefficient of friction against it , which does not help the simplicity . The blades are angled to enhance the lift momentum . they´re 3 types of blades for helicopters and planes : BLADES WITH NO ANGLE ATACK , WITH SLIGHT ANGLE ATACK AND WITH STEP ANGLE ATACK.Also the blades spin in one direction , forcing the helicopter to actually spin in the other direction : Without the rear blade the helicopter would just spin due to Newton 's third law and action-reaction forces . The third law states that `` when one object exerts a force on a second object , the second exerts a force on the first that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction '' Action-Reaction forces means that for every force that the blades exerts , the body of the helicopter will spin proportional.The Rotor , blades in the rear , keep the helicopter going straight . They always oppose the force made by the blades.IN THE SOURCE PAGE I GAVE YOU YOU´LL FIND ALL THE EQUATIONS AND ANSWERS YOU NEED ABOUT THIS TOPIC .",0

"Do they really have govt . grants anyone can get ? It is hard to find grants to start a business . Unlike the myths that some perpetuate , federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business . And yes , grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it , that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.Nonetheless , you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance ( CFDA ) http : //www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http : //www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants . Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.Even if you buy books on `` how to get grants '' or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has , albeit packaged differently . But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.Even SBA does NOT give out grants . From the SBA website http : //www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html '' The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses , although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs . ( See http : //www.sba.gov/financing for more information ) While SBA does offer some grant programs , these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management , technical , or financial assistance . These grants generally support non-profit organizations , intermediary lending institutions , and state and local governments . `` Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements ( e.g . minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant # 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities ( grant 59.043 Women 's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women 's business center that will train women entrepreneurs For private grants , you may want to check the Foundation Center 's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online . It 's a subscription based website ( $ 9.95 per month ) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for `` students , artists , academic researchers , libraries and financial aid offices . '' Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them , so I take it they also do n't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.http : //www.cfda.govhttp : //www.grants.govhttp : //gtionline.fdncenter.orghttp : //www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htmhttp : //www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html",0
"Is mastarbation harmful for health ? Health and psychological effectsIt is held in many mental health circles that masturbation can relieve depression and lead to a higher sense of self-worth . Masturbation can also be particularly useful in relationships where one partner wants more sex than the other—in which case masturbation provides a balancing effect and thus a more harmonious relationship.Both from the standpoint of avoiding unwanted pregnancy and that of avoiding sexually transmitted diseases , masturbation is the safest of sexual practices . There is no credible scientific or medical evidence that manual masturbation is damaging to either one 's mental or physical health.A man whose penis has suffered `` an invasive procedure , blunt trauma or injury during intercourse '' [ 2 ] may suffer later in life from Peyronie 's disease . Usually in the context of an abnormal tunica albuginea , the rare event of penile fracture [ 3 ] may occur . Phimosis is `` a contracted foreskin ( that ) may cause trouble by hurting when an attempt is made to pull the foreskin back '' [ 4 ] . In each of these cases , overly aggressive manipulation of the penis can be problematic.Contrary to popular myth , masturbation does not cause blindness . There is some basis , however , to the myth : zinc is required both to transport vitamin A from the liver to the retina and is excreted in relatively high amount in semen . Thus , it is not inconceivable that in zinc-deficient or vitamin A-deficient environments excessive male masturbation could have caused night blindness ( in which case sexual intercourse has an equal probability of causing blindness ) . Given a normal contemporary diet , however , this is extremely unlikely to happen . There is also the more modern issue of staring at a computer screen while watching pornography for extended periods of time as the pupils tend to dilate during arousal.The only side-effects recorded are that repeated masturbation may result in tiredness or soreness , which tend to make repeated masturbation self-limiting in any case . For men , the volume of ejaculate is temporarily reduced after multiple ejaculations until normal seminal volume is regained in a day or so . Nevertheless , people may experience feelings of guilt during or after masturbation , especially if they come from a socially conservative or religious background.Solitary masturbation carries no risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases . Masturbation involving both a man and a woman can result in pregnancy only if semen contacts the vulva . Any masturbation with a partner can theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted disease by contact with bodily fluids , and such contact should be avoided with any partner whose disease status is uncertain . Objects inserted into the vagina or anus should be clean and of a kind that will not scratch or break . Care should be taken not to fully insert anything into the anus—any object used should have a flared or flanged base ; otherwise retrieval can require a visit to the emergency room . Most modern dildos and anal plugs are designed with this feature.In 1994 , when the first woman appointed Surgeon General of the United States , Dr. Joycelyn Elders , mentioned as an aside that perhaps it ought to be mentioned in school curricula that masturbation was safe and healthy , she was forced to resign , with opponents asserting that she was promoting the teaching of how to masturbate . Many believe this was the result of her long history of promoting controversial viewpoints and not due solely to her public mention of masturbation . Her case led to the coining of a new and humorous slang term for masturbation : Firing the surgeon general.On July 16 , 2003 , an Australian research team led by Graham Giles of The Cancer Council published a medical study [ 5 ] which concluded that frequent masturbation by males may help prevent the development of prostate cancer . The study also indicated that this would be more helpful than ejaculati",0

Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea ! for the devil is come down unto you , having great wrath , because he knoweth that he hath but a short time . 12:13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth , he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child . 12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle , that she might fly into the wilderness , into her place , where she is nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent . 12:15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood . 12:16 And the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth . 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman , and went to make war with the remnant of her seed , which keep the commandments of God , and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .",0

"How can I overcome fear of rejection ? I have a gigantic fear of rejection so it ultimatly leads to me not making decisions that could change my life for the better . I live in this kind of fear all the time trying not to disappoint others , not asking my dream girl out , putting up a barrier that covers up my flaws and makes others see a person I am not .

"Does conditioner damage hair ? Does regularly using conditioner contribute to alopecia ( receding harline ) ? *Noddling solemnly* While many disagree I have to say yes , chemicals ( even in conditioners and shampoos ) can damage hair . One should only wash their hair often enough to keep it clean . Daily doses can over do it , especially if you use the rinse and repeat method.Now I can not say if this is the cause of your problem , but beware products that contain alcohol or lauryl sulphate as they dry out hair and make it brittle.Most people routinely lose between 70 and 150 hairs from their scalp each day , mainly through washing , brushing , and combing.Scalp hair starts to thin when more hairs are lost through normal shedding than the scalp is able to renew . About 40 % of the density of scalp hair has to be lost before thinning of the hair becomes noticeable.Hair loss can be caused by : * Heredity . Most balding is caused by a genetic predisposition - in other words , it 's part of a person 's genetic makeup . This is called male pattern baldness , or hereditary balding or thinning . It is the most common cause of thinning hair . * Illness , certain physical conditions , or their treatments . This can include high fever , thyroid disease , childbirth , inadequate protein in the diet , iron deficiency , cancer treatments , the use of certain medications , and other causes.For more see http : //www.ehealthmd.com/library/hairloss/HL_whatis.htmlSome good alternatives are found here http : //www.answerbag.com/c_view.php/1654",0

"When I read Isaiah 53 , I see the saving death of Jesus perfectly described there . Why do n't the Jews see Him ? It is not that the Jews are blind , it is that Christians see the Hebrew Scriptures through Jesus-colored glasses . Since they read the Christian 's New Testament first , then the TaNaCH , they see the TaNaCH through the lens of Christianity . If read on its own , with no knowledge of , or belief in , Christianity , the Hebrew Scriptures would not be seen as being about Jesus.Jews dont see the Christian interpretation in Isaiah 53 , because it contradicts what the Hebrew Scriptures , the Bible says , clearly and consistently , in at least 3 places : In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself as an atonement for the sins of the people . To be written out of God 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . God 's response was `` No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : '' Exodus 32:30-35And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Eternal ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Eternal , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Eternal said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book ... nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the father . Every man must die for his own sin.The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for God 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and God will forgive us . Nowhere in this chapter does it say that we have to have a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins.Ezekiel 18:1-4 ; 20-24 ; 26-27 ... ..Behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul that sinneth , it shall die ... .The soul that sinneth , it shall die . The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father , neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son : the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him , and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him . But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die . All his transgressions that he hath committed , they shall not be mentioned unto him : in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live . Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die ? saith the Eternal God : and not that he should return from his ways , and live ? So , either Deuteronomy 24:16 , `` Every man must die for his own sin '' does not mean that 'every man must die for his own sin , ' and the Christian interpretation of Isaiah 53 is correct , or the Christian interpretation of Isaiah 53 is not correct , and Deuteronomy 24:16 , 'Every man must die for his own sins ' means exactly what it says.Furthermore , Jews read Isaiah up to ( and including Isaiah 53 ) and Isaiah repeatedly refers specifically to the Jews as Gd 's servant . Read Isaiah 41:8 ; Isaiah 44:21 ; Isaiah 45:4 ; Isaiah 49:3 ; Isaiah 44:1 ; Isaiah 48:20 and Isaiah 49:7 Lets concentrate on Isaiah 43:10 : :Isaiah 43:10 `` You are my witnesses , saith the Etrnl , and my servant whom I have chosen : that ye may know and believe me , and understand that I am he : before me there was no Gd formed , neither shall there be after me . '' The above verse refers to the Jewish People in the plural , when Gd",0

"What are the sympthoms of macular oedema ? An eye disease that diabetics might get . History : Ocular historyDiabetic history - Specific inquiry should be made into risk factors for the development of DR.Type of diabetes - After 20 years of disease , nearly all patients with type I and 60 % of patients with type II have some degree of retinopathy.Duration of the diabetes - Increased risk of DRAge of patient - DR is more likely to present in patients older than 40 years.Diabetic control - The Diabetes Control and Complication Trail ( DCCT ) has clearly demonstrated that tighter control of blood sugar is associated with reduced incidence of DR. ( Glycosylated hemoglobin [ HbA1c ] should be less than 7 % . ) Renal disease - Proteinuria is a good marker for the development of DR ; thus , patients with diabetic nephropathy should be observed more closely.Systemic hypertension - Increased risk of retinopathy ( DR with superimposed hypertensive retinopathy ) Triglycerides and lipids - Normalization of lipid levels reduces retinal leakage and exudates deposition.Pregnancy - DR can progress rapidly in pregnant women , especially those with preexisting DR . Physical : Funduscopy under stereopsis and high magnification should be performed on every patient with diabetes to assess for DME and DR. An indirect ophthalmoscope does not provide adequate magnification for the ophthalmologist to diagnose DME.DME is defined as retinal thickening within 2 disc diameters of the center of the macula.Focal edema is associated with hard exudate rings resulting from leakage from microaneurysms.Diffuse edema results from breakdown of blood-retinal barrier with leakage from microaneurysms , retinal capillaries , and arterioles.CSME , as defined by the ETDRS , exists with any of the following findings : Retinal thickening within 500 mm of the center of the foveaHard , yellow exudates within 500 mm of the center of the fovea with adjacent retinal thickeningAt least 1 disc area of retinal thickening , any part of which is within 1 disc diameter of the center of the foveaOther physical findings that should be noted include the following : Visual acuity is an important parameter in following the progression of CSME , although it does not aid in the diagnosis of CSME because patients may have a visual acuity of 20/20.The status of the posterior hyaloid ; detached , taut , thickenedCauses : Causes include the following : After 20 years of the disease , nearly all patients with type I diabetes mellitus and 60 % of patients with type II diabetes mellitus will have some degree of retinopathy.Poor control of blood sugar increases the risk of diabetic retinopathy.Renal disease can be a marker for the development of diabetic retinopathy.Systemic hypertension increases the risk of diabetic retinopathy.Elevated lipid levels increase the risk of leakage and exudate deposits .",0

"Did baning start with the church ? Its mostly a Christian thing dating back to the Midieval era.If something like Huss 's work on the circulatory system , or Gargantua by Rablais , ( his publisher was burned at the stake ) , or Galleleo 's heliol centric orbital theory conflicted with the doctrines of the Catholic Church then to the extent that knowledge conflicted with the claim of infallibility , yes maybe banning did start there . At that time the Christian faith was managed like an organzied crime ring more powerful and pervaisive than the C Cosa Nostra , but remember , in China in 500 B C all the Confucian Scholars the emperor could arrest were behaeded and their works burned .

"How to fight graft and corruption ? If it is in a corporation , there are special laws to grant you whistleblower status , and you can move into this role under a degree of legal protection from retribution.If it is in a government , then it can be very difficult depending on the nature of the government . Dictatorships are notorious for systemic corruption , and there is little that can be done without coup or significant intervention ( or perhaps populist uprising , although you 'd be risking your life ) . In a democracy , the corruption is of a softer sort , and you may be able to counter-act it via a public interest campaign , or story presented to the news media.Now if the graft and corruption is within your own heart ... that 's a real toughie .

".SINCE CUSTOMERS KNOWN THEIR NEED AND WANTS THERE IS NO NEED FOR MARKETING DISCUSS ? Lets assume customers know all the products available in the market place . Most often there exists similar or substitute products in the market for example the chocolate market , Cadburys vs Nestle or in the soft drinks market Coca Cola vs Pepsi Cola or the car market . How would a potential buyer choose what brand to buy since it ’ s the same product ? To answer this question we must think in marketing terms such as the 4 p ’ s which are product , price , place and promotion . Price communicates a lot about the product such as , expensive means that the product is of the highest quality . Or cheap which can say – buy lots of me but don ’ t give it to your loved ones as a birthday present . Promotion is used to get customers to hear about the product and get them to try it . Product promotion is a strategy used to increase sales , increase product/brand awareness or get rid of stock . A product promotion could be a BOGOF ( buy one get one free ) , by one get second half price , money off coupons , etc . These strategies are used to get customers to buy more of your product or simply try it for the first time.Marketing is the process of exchanging products or the art of persuading people to buy your product . I said exchange because a customer will exchange money for the product they are buying , with so many me too products in the market place a business has to do all it can to convince customers that their product is better than the competition for whatever reason , that ’ s the art of Marketing . Coming up with the right products , setting the right prices , selling the product in the best and most convenient places ( having the product available for purchase ) , communicating the product to the public and convincing customers that your product is better then the competition is the art of selling .",0

"War ? Why ? The real reason please . To force a way of life on the conqured ? Or for power and economic gain ? From the earliest history of humanity , war has always been about only two things - for power , and for resources , and many times it is for both - and many other times it is a war for power cloaked under a war for religion or resources . Hitler claimed he attacked poland for resources - he claimed he needed land for the German people , but that was really for his own power . Religious wars have been fought and are fought for power . For the power that those at the top of religion have over thier people . The best way to consolodate your power over your own people is to unify them against an enemy . That goes for political power as well as religious . The religious leaders of Europe fought the holy wars for thier own gains , claiming it was religious duty , however those at the top weilded the power over thier people by sending them to war . The warriors fought for god and religion , but those in power facilitated this . War will never go away because there will never be equity - someone will always have what someone else has . If by some miracle of technology , anyone can have anything , there will still be wars for power - power is the one thing that ca n't be fabricated . If you look at the current muslim extremists , they are not fighting for thier gods , they are fighting for power , and indirectly for resources . They want to create a muslim world , where they will have the power , and by having the power , they will get the resources . If you look at the heart of any conflict , you 'll see it - resources and power . Those are the core reasons for ANY war . However , since it takes two to make war . The Allies could n't stand aside while Hitler took over Europe and killed millions - wars are started by those who want resources and power , but are ended by people who fight for the defense of themselves and others . Wars are rarely started for honorable reasons , but they are often ended by honorable people , who sacrifice themselves to stop the greedy , the evil , and the powerhungry . However , sometimes , those who fight the evil and powerhungry have dishonorable motives of thier own , but they can claim the moral highground because they did n't start the war , and they will benefit from defeating the ones who started it , and maybe because they destroyed a greater evil , it is accepted . Sometimes you have to trade a great evil for a lesser evil.This also goes for society on the small scale as well - Christians claim homosexuals are evil sinners in order to strengthen thier own group - any group gets stronger with a common enemy . There is no better way to facilitate group cohesion , and this group cohesion in this case leads to even more power for those at the top . Life is a power struggle .",0

"what are the characteristics of fluorine ? - > Pure fluorine ( F2 ) is a corrosive pale yellow gas that is a powerful oxidizing agent . - > It is the most reactive and electronegative of all the elements , and readily forms compounds with most other elements . Fluorine even combines with the noble gases krypton , xenon , and radon . Even in dark , cool conditions , fluorine reacts explosively with hydrogen . - > It is so reactive that glass , metals , and even water , as well as other substances , burn with a bright flame in a jet of fluorine gas . - > It is far too reactive to be found in elemental form and has such an affinity for most elements , including silicon , that it can neither be prepared nor should be kept in glass vessels . In moist air it reacts with water to form the equally dangerous hydrofluoric acid.- > In aqueous solution , fluorine commonly occurs as the fluoride ion F- . Other forms are fluoro-complexes ( such as [ FeF4 ] - ) or H2F+.- > Fluorides are compounds that combine fluoride with some positively charged counterpart . They often consist of ions . Fluorine compounds with metals are among the most stable of salts .",0

"What war was it when we were attacked by Japan at Pearl Harbor W W I or W W II ? it would help if you could also tell me the difference between the two World Wars besides one being the first and the other being the second . I ’ m getting too old , I can ’ t believe anyone would need to ask such a question.World War I , 1914–18 , also known as the Great War , conflict , chiefly in Europe , among most of the great Western powers . It was the largest war the world had yet seen.Causes World War I was immediately precipitated by the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist in 1914 . There were , however , many factors that had led toward war . Prominent causes were the imperialistic , territorial , and economic rivalries that had been intensifying from the late 19th cent. , particularly among Germany , France , Great Britain , Russia , and Austria-Hungary.Of equal importance was the rampant spirit of nationalism , especially unsettling in the empire of Austria-Hungary and perhaps also in France . Nationalism had brought the unification of Germany by blood and iron , and France , deprived of Alsace and Lorraine by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 , had been left with its own nationalistic cult seeking revenge against Germany . While French nationalists were hostile to Germany , which sought to maintain its gains by militarism and alliances , nationalism was creating violent tensions in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy ; there the large Slavic national groups had grown increasingly restive , and Serbia as well as Russia fanned Slavic hopes for freedom and Pan-Slavism.Imperialist rivalry had grown more intense with the new imperialism of the late 19th and early 20th cent . The great powers had come into conflict over spheres of influence in China and over territories in Africa , and the Eastern Question , created by the decline of the Ottoman Empire , had produced several disturbing controversies . Particularly unsettling was the policy of Germany . It embarked late but aggressively on colonial expansion under Emperor William II , came into conflict with France over Morocco , and seemed to threaten Great Britain by its rapid naval expansion.These issues , imperialist and nationalist , resulted in a hardening of alliance systems in the Triple Alliance and Triple Entente and in a general armaments race . Nonetheless , a false optimism regarding peace prevailed almost until the onset of the war , an optimism stimulated by the long period during which major wars had been avoided , by the close dynastic ties and cultural intercourse in Europe , and by the advance of industrialization and economic prosperity . Many Europeans counted on the deterrent of war 's destructiveness to preserve the peace.War 's Outbreak The Austrian annexation ( 1908 ) of Bosnia and Hercegovina created an international crisis , but war was avoided . The Balkan Wars ( 1912–13 ) remained localized but increased Austria 's concern for its territorial integrity , while the solidification of the Triple Alliance made Germany more yielding to the demands of Austria , now its one close ally . The assassination ( June 28 , 1914 ) of Archduke Francis Ferdinand at Sarajevo set in motion the diplomatic maneuvers that ended in war.The Austrian military party , headed by Count Berchtold , won over the government to a punitive policy toward Serbia . On July 23 , Serbia was given a nearly unacceptable ultimatum . With Russian support assured by Sergei Sazonov , Serbia accepted some of the terms but hedged on others and rejected those infringing upon its sovereignty . Austria-Hungary , supported by Germany , rejected the British proposal of Sir Edward Grey ( later Lord Grey of Fallodon ) and declared war ( July 28 ) on Serbia.Russian mobilization precipitated a German ultimatum ( July 31 ) that , when unanswered , was followed by a German declaration of war on Russia ( Aug. 1 ) . Convinced that France was about to attack its western frontier , Germany declared war ( Aug. 3 ) on France and sent troops against France through Belgium and Luxembourg . Germany had hoped for British neutrality , but German violation of Belgian neutrality gave the British government the pretext and popular support necessary fo",0

"what is pollination ? pollination , transfer of pollen from the male reproductive organ ( stamen or staminate cone ) to the female reproductive organ ( pistil or pistillate cone ) of the same or of another flower or cone . Pollination is not to be confused with fertilization , which it may precede by some time—a full season in many conifers . The most common agents of pollination are flying insects ( as in most flowering plants ) and the wind ( as in many trees and all grasses and conifers ) , but crawling and hopping insects , snails , bats , primates , rodents , and hummingbirds may also serve . The devices that operate to ensure cross-pollination and prevent self-pollination ( see sex ) are varied and sometimes extremely intricate . Among them are different maturation times for the pollen and eggs of the same flower or plant , separate staminate and pistillate flowers on the same or on different plants , chemical properties that make the pollen and eggs of the same plant sterile to each other , and specialized mechanisms or structural arrangements that prevent the pollinating agent from transferring the pollen of a flower to its own stigma . In the lady's-slipper the bee enters the nectar-filled pouch by one opening and must leave by another ; in so doing it brushes first past the stigma , which scrapes pollen off its back , and then past the stamens , which deposit another load of pollen . The stamens of the mountain laurel are bent back and held like springs by notches in the petals ; when the bee alights it contacts the tall pistil and then , in probing deeper for nectar , triggers the stamens . Pollen is catapulted onto the insect 's underside , ready for contact with the next pistil . Other examples of floral adaptations to their pollinating agents are the fig and its wasp and the yucca and its moth . Wind pollination , depending as it does on statistical chance for successful pollination , requires vast quantities of pollen , which may be forcefully ejected by the anther sac ( as in grasses and ragweed ) or may be exposed ( as in cones and catkins ) to the slightest breeze .

"Getting started as a Financial Analyst ? I have a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and have over 5 years of experience in the field . Unfortunately I 've decided that it 's not my cup of tea and I have recently looked into switching careers.I 've always been an analytical and thorough person so I feel a career as a financial analyst in a corporate setting ( as opposed to an investment bank ) would suit me well . I 've already taken about 6 accounting classes and have gotten A 's in all of my classes . The only problem is , I do n't know where to get started . What 's the best way into the position ? My options at the moment are : * Get an Associates Degree in Accounting* Get a second Bachelors Degree in Accounting/Finance* Get a Masters Degree in Accounting* Take the CPA exam w/o the required work experienceOut of all of these options , what 's the best choice in getting hired ? I believe your best option is to obtain your bachelors degree in accounting/finance . Inherently , this is a more attractive degree due to the amount of education obtained . Furthermore , any respectable company will require a bachelors degree for a financial analyst position.While the other two options are not bad , they will not help you greatly so I would do them only if it is in addition to the second bachelors degree . Passing the CPA exam without the work experience will not obtain you your certification , which is the true `` resume value '' so you would have only passed a test and would have an interest dinner conversation piece at best.The masters degree in accounting is also nice as a supplement to your bachelors degree , but entirely unnecessary . Most firms/corporations you talk with are not interested in a graduate degree unless it is specifically applicable to the position , which for a financial analyst position it is not . Those are just my thoughts.. : - )",0

"Why does carbon form so many compounds ? There are lots of reasons why there are large number of organic compounds .I ’ m giving U few of them.Catenation : The tendency of an element to form chains of identical atoms is called catenation . This tendency is observed in the case of non-metals showing covalency of two or more . However , this property is maximum in carbon as it can combine with other carbon atoms by single , double or triple covalent bonds . The bonding can be extended to form long open chain ( straight or branched ) or closed ones . Catenation property depends upon the value of bond energy which is maximum in the case of carbon . Bond : C-C Si-Si S-S P-P N-N O-OBond energy : 83 54 54 50 39 35 ( approximately ) ( kcal/mol ) The stability or the strength of the bond decreases as the bond energy decreases . Hence , the tendency of catenation decreases in the following manner ; C > Si ~ S > P > N > OTendency to combine with other non-metals : Carbon has the ability to form strong covalent bonds with many other atoms such as H , O , S , N , Cl , Br , I , etc . The C-C bond energy is approximately equals to the magnitude of bond energies between carbon and various other atoms.Bond C-C C-H C-O C-Cl C-N C-BrBond energy 83.0 97.0 86.0 81.0 73.0 68.0 ( approximately ) ( kcal/mol ) Isomerism is one of the reason also .",0

"how many taste buds do we use when we are tasting our food ? The types are SweetSaltySourBitterUmame ( alluded to above . From the Japanese word for `` savory , '' this responds to meaty tastes , ie high protein , and MSG . MSG is a food additive , Monosodium glutamate -- and glutamate if an amino acid , which are the building blocks for protein ) .And if you want the nitty-gritty , the idea behind taste buds are that various cells detect chemicals , and depending on the region of the brain that the cell is wired to , you know the taste . But not all receptors even of a given type are the same in their mechanism.Sweet reception is more than just a detection of -OH groups . There is a family of transmembrane g-protein coupled receptors called the T1Rs . The various tastes are sensed by various cells , differentiated by the type of receptors expressed in the cell.The sense of sweetness is detected by cells that express a combination of the T1R2 and T1R3 receptors . There is a quality about the sugars that trigger the perception of sweetness such that they bind to one of each of these receptors , creating a heterodimer and trigger the cascade that makes the cell fire . The umami sense is triggered likewise by a coupling of the T1R1 and T1R3 receptors . Some cells are known to express either only T1R2 or only T1R3 , and these have a low affinity detection of sugars ( or perhaps there is a yet unrecognized ligand for these cells ) .Sourness is the result of an acidic pH , with pH being the presence of hydronium ions ( H+ ) at a concentration greater than 10^-7 mole fraction . Sour is detected in sour-sensing cells by H+ ion blocking of the K+ channels , slowing K+ efflux and ultimately depolarizing the cell . Saltiness is detected by Na+ entering the Na+ channels and depolarize the cell.Bitterness is mediated by several distinct receptors that bind to various types of alkaline ( often amine ) molecules , in the T2R family . Bitterness is usually associated with potential toxins , so many receptors detect many things .",0

It depends on the complexity of the rename operation you wich to do.Typically , the mv command is used for renaming , but it is not well suited for batch renames.Most Linux systems now have a newer command called `` rename , '' however its syntax can be complicated.The rename command takes three arguements , from , to , and a list of files upon which the rename is to be applied.For instance : rename .JPG .jpg *.JPG will change all files ending in a .JPG extension to a .jpg extension .",0

I need someones opinion . Which do u think is better living in a dorm going to college ? ORLive at home and go to college ? Living in a dorm all the way.It is important to learn the skills of living on your own before you are completely thrust out to live on your own . People grow up faster in my experience if they have to live in the dorms . Plus that way there is no commute and you have quick access to all the educational and social resources . Be careful about spending too much time with friends and making poor decisions . Those can come back to bite you without your parents looking over your shoulder . Act like a responsible adult and you should be fine .,0
"' ... .and war broke out in heaven.. ' ? what could this possibly have been like ? please indulge me with your imagination , thank you . Satan Cast Out of HeavenIn the early part of our century , there was a war in heaven . The Bible book of Revelation describes what happened : “ And war broke out in heaven : Michael and his [ good ] angels battled with the dragon [ Satan ] , and the dragon and its [ bad ] angels battled but it did not prevail , neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven . So down the great dragon was hurled , the original serpent , the one called Devil and Satan , who is misleading the entire inhabited earth ; he was hurled down to the earth , and his [ bad ] angels were hurled down with him. ” What was the result ? The account continues : “ On this account be glad , you heavens and you who reside in them ! ” The good angels could be glad because Satan and the bad angels , or spirits , were no longer in heaven . But what about people on earth ? The Bible says : “ Woe for the earth and for the sea , because the Devil has come down to you , having great anger , knowing he has a short period of time. ” —Revelation 12:7-9 , 12.Yes , Satan and his wicked companions mislead and cause great woe for people on earth .

"information about light ? Light , form of electromagnetic radiation similar to radiant heat , radio waves , and X rays . Light consists of extremely fast oscillations of an electromagnetic field in a particular range of frequencies that can be detected by the human eye . Different colour sensations are produced by light vibrating at different frequencies , ranging from about 4 × 1014 vibrations per second for red light to about 7.5 × 1014 vibrations per second for violet light . The visible spectrum of light is usually defined by its wavelength , ranging from the smallest visible wavelength for violet , about 40 millionths of a centimetre ( 16 millionths of an inch ) , to 75 millionths of a centimetre ( about 30 millionths of an inch ) for red . Higher frequencies , corresponding to shorter wavelengths , comprise ultraviolet radiation , and still higher frequencies are associated with X-rays . Lower frequencies , which are at longer wavelengths , are called infrared radiation , and still lower frequencies are characteristic of radio waves . Most light comes from electrons that vibrate at these high frequencies when heated to a high temperature . The higher the temperature , the greater the frequency of vibration and the bluer the light produced.Light is emitted from a source in straight lines and spreads out over a larger and larger area as it travels ; the light per unit area diminishes as the square of the distance . When light strikes an object , it is either absorbed or reflected ; light reflected from a rough surface is scattered in all directions . Some frequencies are reflected more strongly than others , and this gives objects their characteristic colour . White surfaces scatter light of all wavelengths equally , and black surfaces absorb nearly all light . Image-forming reflection , on the other hand , requires a highly polished surface such as that of a mirror.Defining the nature of light has always been a fundamental problem in physics . The English mathematician and physicist Sir Isaac Newton described light as an emission of particles , and the Dutch astronomer , mathematician , and physicist Christiaan Huygens developed the theory that light travels by a wave motion.It is now believed that these two theories are essentially complementary , and the development of quantum theory has led to the recognition that in some experiments light acts like a series of particles and in other experiments it acts like a wave . In those situations in which it travels in wave motion , the wave vibrates at right angles to the direction of travel ; therefore light can be polarized in two mutually perpendicular planes ( see Optics ) .III VELOCITY The speed of light was first measured in a laboratory experiment by the French physicist Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau , although earlier astronomical observations had yielded approximately the right velocity . By the 1970s the speed of light had been measured very precisely as 299,792,458 m/sec ( 186,282.397 mi/sec ) in a vacuum , and could be used to measure large distances by the time it took for a pulse of light or radio waves to reach a target and return . This is the principle of radar and sonar . Accurate knowledge of the speed and the wavelength of light also permits accurate measurement of length . In fact , in 1983 the metre was redefined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second . The velocity of light in air varies slightly with wavelength , averaging about 3 per cent less than in vacuum ; the speed in water is about 25 per cent less , and in glass , 33 per cent less.Light has an important effect on many chemicals . Sunlight , for example , is used by plants to carry out photosynthesis , and the exposure of certain silver-containing chemicals to light causes them to turn dark in the presence of other chemicals , as is the case in photography .",0

"what is a good homemade remedy for constipation ? Folks , do you know how NASTY prune juice is ? *shudder*Prunes do work ( and prune juice , if you 're a taste bud masochist ) ; however , they work by a chemical laxative - it 's a natural chemical , but you do n't want to take any chemical inducement on a regular basis , even if it comes from a tree and not from a test tube.If this is a one time thing , it does n't matter really whether you take ex-lax or prunes , they will both work.However , if you have constipation fairly often , it 's going to be more of a management thing than a quick fix sort of thing . At that means adding fiber to your diet . Still , you do n't need to take metamucil every night . First , eat the most whole grain bread you like . For some people , switching from white to whole grain bread may be all you need.Here are some other good sources : Fruits and veggies - the crunchier the better . Apples are especially good , as are whole oranges . ( And cooking does n't destroy fiber , so it only needs to be crunchy in its raw state.Oatmeal , brown rice , and other whole grain cereals and grains . And anything made with these.Citrus marmalades ! Citrus skin is an excellent source of both vitamin C and fiber.Dried fruit . Raisins are good , without the er , immediacy that prunes can incur.So , metamucil , apple , or oatmeal raisin cookie with diced orange peel .",0

"Does size of the male member really matter and if so why ? What about other dimensions ? If we 're talking strictly about sensation produced during the act of intercourse , then it 's the circumfrence that is more important than the length as the sensation comes from friction and you need a larger circumfrence to enhance skin to skin contact to make friction.Too many men think it 's the length when their women are complaining to their women friends of cramping and pain because their man tried to jam it all up there.The other poster said it 's technique and this is also true because if you 've got a long one your woman will make excuses not to have sex if you do n't learn how to use it properly .

"Are there 2 Full moons this month ( december ) ? I read a blog that someone posted that siad that there was a blue moon this month , meaning that there were 2 full moons . The blog siad that 12/31/05 was a blue moon . Is this true ? All I can find is that 12/31 will be our second NEW moon , not blue moon . Nope it has to be 2 full moons . Not 2 new moons . There 's only been one full moon this month . there will be , however , two new moons . one was on the 1st and the other will be the 31st ... . the full moon happened on December 15th.A `` Blue Moon '' is the name given to the second full moon in a calendar month . Because there are roughly 29.5 days between full moons , it is unusual for two full moons to `` fit '' into a 30 or 31 day month ( and impossible to fit into a 28 or 29 day month , so February can never have a Blue Moon ) . The saying `` Once in a Blue Moon '' means a rare occurrence , and predates the current astronomical use of the term , which is quite recent . In fact , Blue Moons are not all that rare , on average there will be one Blue Moon every 2.5 years . After 1999 , the next Blue Moons will be in November 2001 ; July 2004 ; and June 2007 . The last one before 1999 was in July 1996 . The term Blue Moon is believed to have originated in 1883 after the eruption of Krakatoa . The volcano put so much dust in the atmosphere that the Moon actually looked blue in color . This was so unusual that the term `` once in a Blue Moon '' was coined . However , Blue Moon was also used in much the same way we use the term `` Harvest Moon '' . There were twelve names for full moons , one for each month , and the name Blue Moon was used in years which had 13 full moons . It referred to the third full moon of the four occuring between an equinox and solstice in that year . A misinterpretation of this led to a Sky and Telescope Magazine `` Star Quiz '' in July 1943 followed by an article in March 1946 which stated that the second full moon in any calendar month was called a Blue Moon ( attributed to the 1937 Maine Farmers ' Almanac ) , and this definition has now become part of the language . In January and March of 1999 , we had a situation which only takes place about four times a century : two Blue Moons occurring in the same year . The last time this happened was in January and April of 1961 and it will not happen again until January and March of 2018 . A double Blue Moon most commonly occurs in January/March but is also possible in January/April or January/May and only when there is no full moon at all in February . It is also possible to have a Blue Moon in December of one year and March of the next year , again , there is no full moon in the intervening February . That might have been way more info than you wanted , but now you know ... and knowing is half the battle .",0
"Which is better , AMD or Intel ? I know for a fact that AMD is much better than Intel ! AMD 's processors run a lot faster and cooler . A cooler running processor is important .

They were the first company to introduce the 64-bit PC processor many months ahead of Intel ’ s 64-bit processor .

"what 's with the bermuda triangle ? The Bermuda Triangle is a stretch of the Atlantic Ocean bordered by a line from Florida to the islands of Bermuda , to Puerto Rico and then back to Florida . It is one of the biggest mysteries of our time - that is n't really a mystery . The term `` Bermuda Triangle '' was first used in an article written by Vincent H. Gaddis for Argosy magazine in 1964 . In the article Gaddis claimed that in this strange sea a number of ships and planes had disappeared without explanation . Gaddis was n't the first one to come to this conclusion , either . As early as 1952 George X. Sands , in a report in Fate magazine , noted what seemed like an unusually large number of strange accidents in that region . In 1969 John Wallace Spencer wrote a book called Limbo of the Lost specifically about the triangle and , two years later , a feature documentary on the subject , The Devil 's Triangle , was released . These , along with the bestseller The Bermuda Triangle , published in 1974 , permanently registered the legend of the `` Hoodoo Sea '' within popular culture . Several books suggested that the disappearances were due to an intelligent , technologically advanced race living in space or under the sea . The only problem was that the mystery was more hype than reality . In 1975 a librarian at Arizona State University , named Larry Kusche , decided to investigate the claims made by these articles and books . What he found he published in his own book entitled The Bermuda Triangle Mystery-Solved . Kusche had carefully dug into records other writers had neglected . He found that many of the strange accidents were not so strange after all . Often a triangle writer had noted a ship or plane had disappeared in `` calms seas '' when the record showed a raging storm had been in progress . Others said ships had `` mysteriously vanished '' when their remains had actually been found and the cause of their sinking explained . More significantly a check of Lloyd 's of London 's accident records by the editor of Fate in 1975 showed that the triangle was a no more dangerous part of the ocean than any other . U.S. Coast Guard records confirmed this and since that time no good arguments have ever been made to refute those statistics . So the Bermuda Triangle mystery disappeared , in the same way many of its supposed victims had vanished . Even though the Bermuda Triangle is n't a true mystery , this region of the sea certainly has had its share of marine tragedy . Perhaps the best known one was the story of Flight 19 . The tale of Flight 19 started on December 5th , 1945 . Five Avenger torpedo bombers lifted into the air from the Navel Air Station at Fort Lauderdale , Florida , at 2:10 in the afternoon . It was a routine practice mission and the flight was composed of all students except for the Commander , a Lt. Charles Taylor . The mission called for Taylor and his group of 13 men to fly due east 56 miles to Hens and Chicken Shoals to conduct practice bombing runs . When they had completed that objective , the flight plan called for them to fly an additional 67 miles east , then turn north for 73 miles and finally straight back to base , a distance of 120 miles . This course would take them on a triangular path over the sea . About an hour and a half after the flight had left , a Lt. Robert Cox picked up a radio transmission from Taylor . Taylor indicated that his compasses were not working , but he believed himself to be somewhere over the Florida Keys ( the Keys are a long chain of islands south of the Florida mainland ) . Cox urged him to fly north , toward Miami , if Taylor was sure the flight was over the Keys . Planes today have a number of ways that they can check their current position including listening to a set of GPS ( Global Positioning Satellites ) in orbit around the Earth . It is almost impossible for a pilot to get lost if he has the right equipment and uses it properly . In 1945 , though , planes flying over water had to depend on knowing their st",0

Nice description on ameritrade.com ... ..One of the best-known market indicators , the Dow Jones Industrial Average , is comprised of 30 leading companies . Calculated by adding the prices of these 30 stocks , the Dow is now considered a figure that indicates the general state of the market . Originally , the Dow divided the sum of the prices of the 30 stocks by 30 , giving a true average . However , to be consistent every time a stock split or paid a dividend , the number 30 had to be adjusted . Now , over 100 years later , the sum of the prices of the 30 stocks is divided by a number less than one ! Since a $ 1 movement in the price of a $ 100 stock counts equally with a $ 1 movement in the price of a $ 20 stock , the Dow Jones is considered a price weighted index.Charles Dow designed the average to represent the current business market , which in 1896 included industries such as sugar , leather , tobacco , gas , rubber and coal .

"Alabama and education for children with pdd-nos / Autism ? I assume you are asking about what education is available for children with the disorder in Alabama . I am not familiar with Alabama 's resources but as a parent of a profoundly mentally challenged child , I will tell you what I do know . The best place to start is ask your pediatrician about resources . The mental health facility is a very good place to start . Depending on the child 's age , your area may have something available like First Steps , which is an early intervention service for children with developmental delays available for children up to 3 years old . First Steps was wonderful for my daughter . After she turned 3 , we were referred to a state-run facility that basically gave us a case manager and helped to identify the special needs for our child but after 3 years with them , we still have not been able to actually RECEIVE services because the waiting list is so long , then they go through freezes . I hope your state is not as backed up as ours is . As far as education , public schools are required to provide an education to special needs children , per the Americans with Disabilities Act . The special needs child is given an IEP ( individualed education plan ) so that the child is taught what is appropriate for his/her abilities . The parent 's involvement and input in the IEP is very important . If you do not agree with the IEP , you can change it . Individuals with Disabilities Education Act : The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) ( formerly called P.L . 94-142 or the Education for all Handicapped Children Act of 1975 ) requires public schools to make available to all eligible children with disabilities a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment appropriate to their individual needs.IDEA requires public school systems to develop appropriate Individualized Education Programs ( IEP 's ) for each child . The specific special education and related services outlined in each IEP reflect the individualized needs of each student.IDEA also mandates that particular procedures be followed in the development of the IEP . Each student 's IEP must be developed by a team of knowledgeable persons and must be at least reviewed annually . The team includes the child 's teacher ; the parents , subject to certain limited exceptions ; the child , if determined appropriate ; an agency representative who is qualified to provide or supervise the provision of special education ; and other individuals at the parents ' or agency 's discretion.If parents disagree with the proposed IEP , they can request a due process hearing and a review from the State educational agency if applicable in that state . They also can appeal the State agency 's decision to State or Federal court .

It looks like treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms.Surgery to remove the lesions may be accomplished with excellent cosmetic results when the number of lesions is few . However , in many cases the number and location of lesions may preclude surgical excision . Draining the lesions with a large needle is also temporarily effective . Oral antibiotics in the tetracycline family have been tried with limited success . Accutane has also been tried with mixed results .

"If the core of a nuclear plant went critical ( china syndrome ) would it actually melt it 's way to china ? This is prob a stupid question , I just saw the movie and I missed the explanation of the result of a china syndrome . All nuclear plants that are producing power must be `` critical . '' The plant is shut down when it is `` subcritical . '' A nuclear accident can occur if the reactor goes `` supercritical . '' A supercritical plant can release uncontrolled heat drying the core and melting it . A melted core would fall by gravity toward the center of the world ( like anything else that falls ) . Since Canton OH was almost directly opposite Canton China on the globe , the core would fall toward China , thus the China syndrome . Of course the core would have to melt its way past the plant barriers but would not release enough energy to reach China let alone deeply penetrate the earth . For those with a wild imagination , China would also be protected by the massive molten layer in the center of the earth that surrounds the extremely hard metal core . None-the-less , China Syndrome is a catchy phrase .",0

"what is an interrupt ? There is a good summary of what an interrupt is at the sources listed below . Cutting and pasting the content from one link : A signal informing a program that an event has occurred . When a program receives an interrupt signal , it takes a specified action ( which can be to ignore the signal ) . Interrupt signals can cause a program to suspend itself temporarily to service the interrupt . Interrupt signals can come from a variety of sources . For example , every keystroke generates an interrupt signal . Interrupts can also be generated by other devices , such as a printer , to indicate that some event has occurred . These are called hardware interrupts . Interrupt signals initiated by programs are called software interrupts . A software interrupt is also called a trap or an exception . PCs support 256 types of software interrupts and 15 hardware interrupts . Each type of software interrupt is associated with an interrupt handler -- a routine that takes control when the interrupt occurs . For example , when you press a key on your keyboard , this triggers a specific interrupt handler . The complete list of interrupts and associated interrupt handlers is stored in a table called the interrupt vector table , which resides in the first 1 K of addressable memory .",0

"What exactly do stem cells do ? I 've come across a product that claims to promote the release of adult stem cells : what would be the benefit of that ? Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can , under the right conditions , turn into any other kind of cell . They are of particular interest to scientists in that they may provide a means to replace damaged cells that the body can not naturally replaced ( in the spinal chord , for example ) . Stem cells are often talked about ( not inacurately ) in the context of curing numerous degenerative neurological conditions ( Parkinsons , Altzeimers , ALS , etc . ) as well as other conditions that can be traced to the malfunction of a particular type of cell ( they could be used , for example , to replace insuline-sectreteing cells in type I diabetes ) .Although I have not heard of a product like the one you mentioned , I would be inclined to say it does absolutely nothing . Stem cells are only useful if they can be made to differentiate and become a specific type the specific type of cell that is needed , where that type of cell is needed . Flooding the body with stem cells will not make that happen . My best guess is that it is an attempt to profit off the wide-spread association of the term `` stem cell '' with curing uncurable diseases and , by extention , with improved health in general .",0

"Though electron affinity of fluorine is greater than flourine , Flourine acts as a better oxidising agent.Why ? I am assuming you are talking about fluorine and chlorine . But electron affinity deals only with the atoms ability to accept an electron . Oxidation deals with interactions between atoms . Fluorine being smaller has more atoms that are close to the atom being oxidized and thus greater charge density around the atom it 's oxidizing . Electron affinity deals only with electrons and no atoms thus electron repulsion of the smaller fluorine orbitals cause a decrease in electron affinity when compared to the larger atom of chlorine . I am not sure this is correct but it is all I could think of . Good luck .",0

"Who supports these liars in the White House ? Do you remember Lawrence Lindsey ? He was one of King George ’ s II economic policy advisor 's and Director of the National Economic Council from 2001 to 2002 . He was fired in 2002 after suggesting that the Iraq War would cost upwards of $ 200 billion . The official administration propaganda at the time said the war would cost $ 60 billion . They also said we would be greeted as liberators and showered with flowers.Mr . Lindsey was wrong . Congress has already appropriated $ 357 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan . Remember , these cost are on top of the $ 400+ billion a year we already spend on defense.It gets worse . According to a new economic study by Joseph Stiglitz , a former Chief Economist of the World Bank and a Nobel Prize winner in economics , the future cost of our current war/occupation will be between $ 1 trillion to $ 2 trillion.This nation spent $ 800 billion adjusted for inflation to fight the war in Vietnam . However this isn ’ t the true cost of a war . An additional $ 1 trillion was spent on Veterans benefits and interest payments after the war.What does this mean to you and your family ? It comes out to be about $ 19,600 per U.S. Household . That would have been enough to finance the shortfall in Social Security for 150 to 300 years . NO ! ! ! This is the same evidence I have used in recent months for reasons NOT to support the Iraq War . It gets worse friend.It seems that America 's continued interest in Iraq may have sparked a civil war for the `` democratic '' powers of the Iraq country . Now , America must spend billions more in building a better Iraqi military to avert any new war . This event continues to return again and again for the US.Let 's recall:1 ) The rebellion of US military forces in Mexico during the early 20th century.2 ) The resistance of American diplomacy in the Phillipines in 1898 . ( Imperialism ) 3 ) The disaster in Vietnam during the Nixon administration.The results always ends with American taxpayers paying for the problems that a Republican administration makes and the Democratic Party 's occupancy in the White House . Somehow ( probably in 2009 ) America will once again fix the problems that are prevalent now . But , our next problem will be Venezuela as it continues to be a nuissance to our sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere . Just call this the Neverending Story .",0

I am Iraqi and I want to know Why the Americans are in Iraq ? ? ? There is a Republican thinktank in our country called Project for a new American Century .

They are currently feeding Americans propaganda about how you want us in your country and how the soldiers do n't have time to kill anyone in Iraq because they are so busy handing out crayons and toys to Iraqi children .

"what are the differences between the processes of fission and fusion ? The main difference that there is between fission and fusion is that fission is the splitting of an atom to form two smaller ones while fusion is the fusing of two smaller atoms to form a larger atom . In each of these the binding energy of the final product or products is higher than that of the prerequisites . This is explained more fully in the next section ( Binding Energy ) .Fission itself is a nuclear process which does not usually occur naturally in nature ( at least not that we know of ) as it requires a large mass and an incident neutron to start the reaction . However this would not last for a long time as the reaction would explode and produce a result such as in an atomic bomb . This volatile nature is what prevents fission from occurring for any length of time naturally.Fusion on the other hand is a process which occurs quite naturally . In fact , if fusion did not occur naturally we would not be around today . This is due to stars being the result of the fusion process , the fusion of mainly light atoms into heavier atoms . Fusion also releases a lot more energy in comparison to fission in relation to the mass input . Put simply you will get more energy released from the fusion of 1kg of hydrogen ions than you will from fission of 1kg of Uranium .",0

"Why does my new computer suddenly run very slow when CD-R is accessing data ? ( This is a new problem. ) ? Even when Winamp is playing an mp3 from the hard drive , it will suddenly play very slowly if the CD-R reads something on a CD for another program . It did n't do this when the computer was new ( 3 months ago ) , but just started . instead of ripping CD audio at 18X , it is around 7X now . It 's hard to say what could be the exact cause of the problem , but most problems with speed on a computer somehow tie back to Spyware issues . Many times spyware/adware programs that are running in the background ( depending on which type ) will try to access all your drives ( not only the CD drive , but the HDD as well ) and decrease your machine 's performance . The other possiblity could be a hardware issue , as a technician , I 've seen many times data cables go bad or CD motors fail . You could be running out of RAM , Since the machine is only about 3 months old , i doubt very much it 's hardware ( but i 'd definitely suggest getting the Laser cleaned with a CD laser cleaner ) . The problem is most likely software related ( either spyware or a settings issue ( like a DMA setting or something ) ) . Either way , since you 're more than likely to be under some kind of mfg . warranty , i 'd take advantage and call them up , for some kind of support .",0

"What is Eid al Adha ? Eid ul-Adha ( Arabic : عيد الأضحى ) occurs on the tenth day of the Islamic month of Dhul Hijja . It is one of two Eid festivals that Muslims celebrate . Eid ul-Adha is celebrated by Muslims worldwide as a commemoration of Prophet Ibrahim 's willingness to sacrifice his son for God.Muslims believe that God revealed in a dream to Ibrahim ( Prophet Abraham ) to sacrifice his son Isma ’ il . Ibrahim and Isma ’ il set off to Mina for the sacrifice . As they went , the devil attempted to persuade Ibrahim to disobey God and not to sacrifice his beloved son . But Ibrahim stayed true to God , and drove the devil away . As Ibrahim prepared to sacrifice his son , God stopped him and gave him a sheep to sacrifice instead . The story is also a part of the other Abrahamic religionsIt is celebrated on the 10th day of the month of Dhul Hijja ( ذو الحجة ) of the lunar Islamic calendar , after Hajj , the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia . This happens to be approximately 70 days after the end of the month of Ramadan.While Eid ul-Fitr is considered to be three days , Eid ul-Adha is supposed to be four days . The first day is the primary holiday , on which men , women , and children are expected to dress in their finest clothing and perform prayer ( Salah ) in a large congregation . Muslims who can afford to do so sacrifice domestic animals , usually sheep , as a symbol of Ibrahim 's sacrifice ; this sacrifice is called `` Qurban . '' The meat is distributed amongst their neighbors , relatives , and the poor and hungry . The charitable instincts of the Muslim community are demonstrated during Eid ul-Adha by the concerted effort to see that no impoverished Muslim is left without sacrificial food during this day . Coming immediately after the Day of Arafat ( when Muhammad pronounced the final seal on the religion of Islam ) , Eid ul-Adha gives concrete realization to what the Muslim community ethic means in practice .",0

"How does one become a taxidermist ? I am looking for a career , but I can not and will not learn Algebra . Any suggestions ? IntroductionTaxidermy programs prepare people to create lifelike models of wildlife and fish . Students learn how to select materials from dead animals and how to use artificial resources such as glass , wax , and foam . They study methods to create needed parts and care for models . In addition , they learn to manage a business and advertise their services.OverviewThe Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti once said that `` the object of art is not to reproduce reality , but to create a reality of the same intensity . '' As an art form , taxidermy does exactly this.Contrary to popular belief , taxidermists do not take dead animals and stuff them for display . Although this practice used to exist , most taxidermists would frown upon this mere attempt to `` reproduce reality . '' Instead , taxidermists are artists who re-create `` a reality of the same intensity '' by using a combination of artificial resources and natural materials from animal corpses.If you 've ever been to a museum of natural history or science , you may have seen the work of a taxidermist . You might have seen the form of an antelope 's head mounted on wood or a lifelike representation of a jackrabbit in a setting crafted to look like a forest clearing.As a taxidermist , you help to preserve the memory of animals . Just as other artists do , you pay close attention to details that others might not notice . You look at color , texture , expression , and muscle movement . You combine crafts such as carpentry , woodworking , tanning , and molding and casting to give renewed life to these details . You also use the artistic talent required for drawing , sculpting , and painting.You might show your work at competitions , in shops and museums , or in the private homes of your customers.In taxidermy programs , you learn to build frames and forms to substitute for animal skulls and skeletons . You study the techniques for sculpting clay heads or bodies and finishing models with painting and preservation . You also learn to preserve animal components such as skin , feathers , and fur.Proprietary schools and some community colleges offer taxidermy programs . You can typically earn a certificate which takes anywhere from a few weeks to a year of full-time study after high school . ''",0

"What if you are wrong ? Like the song says , What if you are wrong and Christ is the son of God who has died for you and is the only way to the Father . Are you be willing to take that risk without at least searching for the truth ? Is your eternity worth looking into ? But I am not wrong , unless you think the Bible is wrong ! And if the Bible is not wrong , then you should examine your beliefs , and you will come to the conclusion you should convert to Judaism.The place i look to see what i should believe , and to check against to see if other beliefs are wrong is the Bible , the Hebrew Scriptures , and when i check i check in the original Hebrew.Here is what it says , in contrast to Christianity : : : The Christian understanding is that the Messiah , Jesus , died for the sins of the people . The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin.But we are taught in our Torah that no one can die for the sins of another . In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death forthe fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin ( eesh b'chet-o yumatu ) .In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself to atone for the sins of the people . To be written out of Gd 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . Gd 's response is No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : Exodus 32:30-35 And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Etrnl ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Etrnl , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Etrnl said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book . The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for Gd 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd will forgive us.So , the Bible is clear , no one can die for the sins of another , and this means that Jesus can not die for anyone else 's sins.Christians also believe that one needs a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin , that one who does not have such a blood sacrifice will die in their sins , and go to hell , except for the sacrifice of Jesus.This , too , is UnBiblical . The Bible describes blood sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin in the Book of Leviticus . But it is in Leviticus itself , in the middle of the discussion of the sin sacrifices , that we are taught that we do not need a blood sacrifice to be forgiven for our sins . Offering a blood sacrifice was an expensive thing to do for the family offering the animal . Was forgiveness then , to be only for the rich ? No , because if one could not afford a blood sacrifice then one who sins could bring flour , which has no blood and no life as their sacrifice , and Gd forgave them ! Leviticus 5:11-13 ; But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering ; he shall put no oil upon it , neither shall he put any frankincense thereon : for it is a sin offering.Furthermore , read the Book of Jonah . In Jonah , the People of Ninevah do three things in order to be forgiven by Gd . They fast , they pray for forgiveness , and they stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgave them ! This is exactly what we do on Yom Kippur , we fast , we pray for forgiveness , and , hopefully , we stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgives us . And what book do we read on Yom Kippur afternoon ? The Book of Jonah ! Jonah 3:7-10 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Ninevah , by the decree of the King and his noble",0
"why curreny notes are not printed in sufficient amount to fulfill the needs of everyone ? If more money is printed , inflation increases .

"How do you feel about our President George Bush ? My opinion is that I do n't like him/I did not vote for him ! The terms liberal and conservative are for people who are neither .

This year , Democrates seems to have collected their courage and are standing up to the Executive Branch ( even Republicans are standing up to Bush now ! ) Even if I do n't like our President , I pray that he gets the courage and stop dishonoring to our country and tell the whole truth and ask for forgivness like a true Christian would . I really wish that Bush would lead our country away from foreign oil dependence . The fact is that the past five Presidents have said this and did nothing . I hope this Bush can honour his promise and really do something to get America out of the mess he got us in . You are exactly right . Sometimes true courage is admitting that you were wrong .",0
"Can i use more than 1 anti-virus software in my PC ? How ? I want to install an anti-virus software ( panda ) , but i 'm told to uninstall my old program ( symantic ) .Can i install it without remove my old program ? I assume you 're using Windows . Using two anti-virus programs creates conflicts . For instance when you download a file both will try to scan it at the same time .

"Is forgiveness possible ? My husband cheated a lot before we got married , mostly with people he met from the internet . Now I have a problem with him being online . Is it possible to let this go and forgive/forget ? If you knew he was cheating before you got married , more than likely he 's cheated or is wanting to cheat since you 've been married . This was not a secret that was kept from you and you knew what you were getting into before you got married . Do this , ask yourself these questions : Have you found any evidence that shows he has cheated or is wanting to cheat ? Have you confronted him about it and have you shared your feelings with him about this ? Is this relationship with this person really that important to you ? If any of the above answers give you that `` sick to your stomach / queezee '' feeling , then you might want to reconsider your marriage with this person . You should n't have to have these bad feelings everyday , especially if this person is supose to be your best friend and soulmate . If you are ok with it and can work things out and be happy , then YES , forgive and forget . Everyone should get a second chance.Good luck and take care .",0

"What is lake-effect snow ? Lake effect snow is also know as a snowsquall . It is produced in the winter when cold winds move across long expanses of warmer lake water , picking up water vapor which freezes and is deposited on the lee shores . This effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic effect of higher elevations on the downwind shores . This uplifting can produce narrow , but very intense bands of precipitation , which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow per hour . The areas affected by lake effect snow are called snowbelts.Cold winds in the winter typically prevail from the west-southwest to the northwest in the North Temperate Zone , producing the most dramatic lake effect snow falls on the northeast to south east shores of the Great Lakes . This lake effect produces a significant difference between the snow fall on the eastern and western shores of the Great Lakes . If the air temperature is not low enough to keep the precipitation frozen , it falls as lake effect rain.To can read a detailed article on Lake Snow Effect , Variables Contributing to Lake Effect Snow and Areas Hit By Lake Effect Snow and much more at the following articles : ( 1 ) http : //www.noaa.gov/questions/question_011602.html ( 2 ) http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_effect_snow ( 3 ) http : //www.usatoday.com/weather/tg/wlakeeff/wlakeeff.htm ( 4 ) http : //www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/ ( 5 ) http : //www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap10/lake_effect_snow.html",0

Without all these talented power brokers nearby , he would n't have lasted 5 minutes in the Oval .",0
"how to treat plantar faciitis ? There are several things you can try.Anti-inflammatory medications like Ibuprofen or Naproxen may be helpful , taken with food.Fill an empty soda bottle with water and freeze . With a sock on , roll your heel over the ice bottle for 10-15 minutes , 3-4 times a day.NEVER go barefoot ! NOt even to the bathroom in the middle of the night . Always have good supportive shoes on.Stretching your calf muscle may help , particularly if you have a tight achilles to begin with . Face a wall , and place your plans on it . With the affected leg further behind you , lean into the wall , keeping your back leg straight and the heel on the floor . Then stretch with your knee slightly bent.If these methods do n't work , see your health care provider . A stronger anti-inflammatory medicine may be prescribed , he or she may evaluate you for orthotics , or supports that go into your shoes . Physical therapy may be helpful , and some people even have a cortisone injection into the heel .",0

"How often should you get your well water tested ? We tested it over 8 years ago and it had some pesky little buggers in it so we ca n't drink it . The pump went bad and we fixed it and added clorox to the well like your supposed to . Do the organisms change over time ? Whether the organisms change over time depends on the origin of the microorganisms . If the contamination resulted from surface water intruding into the well , the conditions may have changed.Since you suspected the well water to cause allergic reactions , I 'd advise you have it tested on microorganisms again . The chlorox was added to the water after the pump , or to the bottom ? The intervals of microbiological testing depend on the amount of water you draw and the use you put the water to . If it gets into contact with food or cutlery , I 'd advise intervals of 3 to 5 years . If the chlorox treatment has rendered it drinkable , regular repeats are necessary , also in order to manage the dosage .",0

"Where did the wedding custom of the bride wearing white come from ? The tradition of wearing white at weddings began due to the choice of colour of the wedding dress of Queen Victoria at her wedding to Prince Albert . Queen Victoria was not the first royal bride to wear a white wedding gown , but the first of the modern era . White had been a traditional colour of royal mourning , and although not often utilized as such , white was not considered a suitable choice for a royal wedding . Victoria 's choice popularized the white gown as no other had before her . Previously , brides wore their best clothes or the most expensive new clothes they could afford . Gold or gold-threaded dresses became popular with royal brides ; the rank-and-file wore dresses that reflected their station . White was one of many choices , pastel shades were also popular .",0

"Can diffusion take place in solids ? Yes.Orthoclase feldspar is an example . At high temperatures , Fe will fit into the orthoclase lattice . As temperature drops , the lattice shrinks so that Fe no longer fits . Fe diffuses out of the latice and accumulates along the planes between orthoclase crystal twins . Along the way , it grabs O to produce Fe2O3 . If you look closely at pink granite , usually you will see that the pink grains are actually white and red striped . Those grains are orthoclase crystals with exsolved hematite along twin planes.Exsolution and diffusion of Fe from orthoclase can only occur at high temperature . If the orthoclase cools too quickly for the Fe to diffuse out , it will remain in the orthoclase lattice , which will be distorted to accomodate the larger ( larger than K ) Fe ion.Material science is not boring .",0

"My stolen credit card information was used in CA , I live in CO ... What is the best way to prosecute ? Unlike many ID VICTIMS I have heard about , I was lucky enough to be online and watch my bank account dwindle and was able to catch the ID THIEF . The problem I seem to be haveing is the `` THEFTS '' happened in California , yet I live in Colorado .

Any cases you know of that are similar to this so I can refer a judge to that case ? Thanks ! To get the guy off the street is probably not your responsibility , but less within your ability . If the credit card company has reimbursed you and covered it , it 's more up to the company to decide how to proceed . You should contact your credit card company to follow up and ask what they 'll do to press charges against the one who defrauded you , if they know who he is . It 's more up to them to decide at this point , since they hold the information and the control , and since it 's mostly in their best interest .

"What items do I need for winter camping to stay warm ? A nice pair of silk long johns is a good place to start . Other little treats for yourself include down clothing , they even make pants . I have a pair of down booties for use in the sleeping bag . Other little clothing tidbits . Wear a hat at all times , even sleeping . You can also sleep with a warm water bottle . Some cautions with this : make sure you know whether the bottle leaks and Nalgene 's are notoriously leaky , if you or your bag gets wet , you may be having a harder time keeping warm . If so you can contain it in a ziplock bag or a roll down velcro closure bag . If the water is too hot , you should put it in a sock or something to keep from burning your skin . My hiking buddy/co worker went to bed with a hot water nalgene between his thighs one night . He thought that was clever because a LOT of blood passes through there and warm blood travels to other parts of the body , warming them . But he woke up with blisters on his thighs ... dangerously close to the family jewels . Last word about hot water bottle , if you use a collapsible canteen or bottle , make sure you fill it allllll the way up , because even then your bottle will cave in as the water cools down . At the very least you want to minimize this so you do n't ruin your bottle . If the bottle cools this way , it will never hold as much as it used to.A good camping mat . The closed cell foam ones that roll up are cheap and effective and very lightweight , the next step up is the self inflating ones but they are heavier . And you can buy covers for those inflating mats that convert them into a chair.You need to dress warm . The most effective thing in my opinion , and also more versatile , is to dress in multiple light layers . In the winter , I wear about 8 layers in the coldest weather ... long john shirt , tee shirt , maybe a button down shirt , a fleece vest , as many fleece crewneck tops ( the fuzzy polartec type , not sweathshirt fleece ) as I can pile on , and my rain jacket . The good news is that if I can add or remove pieces at will until I am perfectly comfortable . IF you go the other route of a couple indoor layers and then one big poofy piece you need to understand the principles of loft , which includes your sleeping bag.Loft is the way insulation in a comforter , parka , or sleeping bag works . They create tiny little air pockets around you and hold YOUR OWN body heat in them . IF you have a lot of clothing between you and the insulating item , you will actually defeat the purpose of the item because you insulate the item FROM your body heat . This is why many things are true : it is better to sleep with fewer clothing items when you want to be warmer in the bag . It is also important not to compromise loft by choosing an item that does n't fit your body and causes you to squash it from the inside out , or with a bunch of heavy layers on top of it to squash it from the outside in . If you compress your item too much , even in storage , or in your pack or its stuff sack , there are fewer air pockets formed and the item does n't work as well.SO choose ONE dressing strategy and know how to apply it.Other important facts : All the things discussed so far are only ways to insulate yourself . They are not generating any heat on their own . To do that , you need to DRINK plenty of water , and you need to EAT , warm foods that are high in sugars and fats are excellent , and you need to MOVE . A bedtime snack can be anything from a candy bar to a stick of butter , NO kidding ! A bedtime activity could be a couple minutes jumping up and down , then one last go at the fire . AND YOU MUST DRINK WATER . Even if you ca n't stand cold liquids . EVEN IF you do n't want to be up all night peeing . Your body needs the water to circulate the blood , and to metabolize food , both of which assist you in staying warm . Another thing you need to know about water is that both dehydration and hypothermia have the early warning sign of disorientation and confusion . The trouble is , if YOU are the one",0
"Is any government policy for the poor people really benifits them or bring any change in their livlihood ? You have to remember that government programs to help the poor are really just applying a financial band-aid to the problem .

"why was u.s.s.r.'seconomy having proplems under communism ? I lived in Moscow in 1992 for five months ... one of the vestiges of the communist system was the local food-staple ( milk , sugar , eggs and four ) market . Part of the system was to create jobs for all-To buy anything from this market you had to stand in an hour-long line to get a ticket that represented an item like a bag of flour , then you had to stand in an hour-long line to pay for what the tickets represented , then you had to go into another hour-long line to pick up the items you paid for , and finally you had to wait in an hour-long line for them to check your purchases against the reciepts and tickets . Four hours to buy milk and eggs- assuming you know exactly what you want.In a word , the economy was suffering from gross `` inefficiency '' that made profitability impossible . The inefficiencies came from govt . corruption and the notion that everyone should have a job ( even if the work is meaningless like it was in the market ) . Because it almost always cost more to produce than the benefit of production , the govt . borrowed heavily to support it 's programs ( which included almost all business because the govt . `` nationalized '' meaning they owned almost all of them ) leading to massive inflation and the eventual implosion of its economy .",0

"how many years of study are involved in becoming a chemist ? how many years of study are involved in becoming a chemist ? What is the minimum education that is required ( Obviously , university minimum ) ? Where would/could you obtain this education ? What are the entrance requirements for these schools ? How many years ? Post graduate ? Help is needed ! Thanks : ) I recently graduated from Ohio University with a BS in Chem . It takes 4yrs wherever you go , and you can go straigt to gradschool depending on how far you want to take it , but you need at least a four year degree to get a decent job . A Masters degree will be another 2yrs , and a PhD another 4-5yrs . The more schooling you finish , the more you 'll be paid , basically . But also the more responsibility you will have . With a BS you can get a job doing bench chemistry at a variety of businesses , including pharmaceutical companies , cosmetics , and personal hygeine companies among others . You 'll start out at a decent wage and work your way up . Myself , I decided I did n't want to be in the lab , and got into the office of a company that deals with rubber chemistry . They were very happy to have my chemical background in the office . It just depends on what you 're looking for.As for requirements , obviously each shool varies . You will need , of course , a highschool degree or equivalent . Your GPA will need to be C+/B- or above . Schools like to see above average test scores as well ( take both the SATs and the ACTs , as well as the highschool proficiency exams ) . They also like to see that you are involved in some sort of extracurricular such as sports , community volunteering , or student or local government .",0

"mendelssons traditional wedding march was first played at whos wedding , and what yr ? From Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia.Jump to : navigation , searchMendelssohn 's Wedding March is one of the best known of the pieces that he wrote for A Midsummer Night 's Dream in 1842.At weddings in many English-speaking countries , this piece is commonly used as a recessional , though frequently stripped of its episodes in this context.The first time it was used at a wedding was when Dorothy Carew wed Tom Daniel at St Peter ’ s Church , Tiverton , UK , on 2 June 1847 . However it did not become popular at weddings until it was selected by Victoria , The Princess Royal for her marriage to the Crown Prince of Prussia on January 25 , 1858.The organ on which the Wedding March was allegedly composed is housed in St Ann 's Church Tottenham .",0
"Is Intel Better or AMD ? Can anyone tell me whether AMD computers are better or the Intel ones . I was told by somebody that even AMD Sempron does not require any additional graphic card and could play any type of game however high graphics the game may have . The graphics built into the motherboard is what controls the graphics , not the cpu . Having a fast processor helps , but to play games like half life 2 you would probably still need to buy a separate graphics card . Your computer is only as fast as the weakest link so do n't overspend in one area ( cpu ) and leave another too slow ( memory or graphics ) . For processor speed comparisons check out the link . Look for the benchmarks at the end . The site reviews many different computer parts .",0

"Does debris affect a tornadoes wind speed ? The funnel of a tornado is actually clear . The only way we actually see the tornado is because of the debris that is circulating inside the funnel . The wind speed of the tornado will not increase because of debris . Debris can only be a hinderance to a tornado . To help you think about this , think about a very large piece of debris , lets say a mountain . Now while the mountain is not going to be picked up and tossed around like dirt , cows , trucks and some houses , it is still something that is getting in the way of a tornado . The mid-west experiences far more tornadoes than any other region . This is because they are uninhibited from forming . Basically the more you put in the way of the funnel the more difficult it will be for that funnel ( aka the tornado ) to form . To put it on a level that everyone can relate to , think of your toilet . When you flush the toilet the water starts to swirl . A funnel begins to appear in the water and eventually everything goes away . What happens if there is too much TP ( debris ) in the way ? The funnel never forms and you get a clog . I hope this helps .",0

"how do i score a 750+ + score for the GMAT ? Which courses , books etc should I use ? The GMAT is essentially a glorified SAT - all the stuff in there you definitely learned pre-college . I 've never been a big proponent of the GMAT classes because I feel you can get everything out of the book . The class is n't going to teach you some random formula you do n't already know . Both the books and classes essentially spell out what format of questions will be asked in each section . Then they drill you on that format repeatedly until solving for that type of equation or that grammatical structure is second nature no matter what weird way they ask it on the test . I would recommend getting one of the books , Kaplan is pretty much the industry standard . Read it all the way through . Then take every practice test in the book , then save a few bucks and go hang out in the bookstore and take a half a dozen practice tests in other GMAT prep books . Review every question on your test you got wrong and go back into the book to see what “ format ” of question it is and review that again . Then use the free CDROM that should come with your prep book to focus in on any sections you are bombing on the practice tests . This worked for me and one of my buddies . We studied for about two weeks for an average of 3 hours a day and topped out over 750 . The MCAT would be another story…thank god I don ’ t want to be a doctor…",0

"why do some people get addicted to drugs and some do n't ? Addiction to drugs and alcohol tends to run in families and may have to do with how the brain processes certain chemicals , particularly those of the `` feel good '' type , which may be lacking or dormant in the addict until they are activated by drugs or alcohol . According to Carl Jung , alcoholic drinking is seen as a reflection of the human need , gone wrong , for a spiritual life . In a famous letter to Bill Wilson , Jung wrote that the craving for alcohol is the equivalent , on a low level , of the spiritual thirst of our being for wholeness , or union with God . Jungnotes that in the word alcohol in Latin is spiritus , a word that describes the highest religious experience , as well as the most depraving poison . In solving the problem of alcoholism , Jung offered the formula spiritus contra spiritum . A figurative translation of this Latin formular is , `` it takes the Spirit of God to overcome the harmful spirit of alcohol . ”",0

"who is william blake ? William Blake ( November 28 , 1757 – August 12 , 1827 ) was an English poet , painter and printmaker . Though largely unrecognised during his lifetime , today Blake 's work is almost universally considered that of a genius . According to Northrop Frye , who undertook a study of Blake 's entire poetic opus , his prophetic poems form `` what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the [ English ] language '' . Others have praised Blake 's visual artistry , in particular his engravings : `` [ Blake ] is far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced '' [ 1 ] .However , viewing Blake 's accomplishments in either poetry or in the visual arts separately is to do him a disservice ; Blake himself saw these two disciplines as being cohorts in a unified spiritual endeavour , and they are inseparable in a proper appreciation of his work .",0

"How frequently do I use grunt and anteler calls while deer hunting in the rut ? It all depends on where you are hunting and what the buck to doe ratio is . If you are hunting on public property and the buck to doe ratio is 1/5 or worse you will want to be very timid with your calling . For one there is not much competition for does so the fighting does not occur as much and for two if you are on a heavily hunted area and other people are calling wrong or overcalling all they are doing is educating the deer and they will not respond as well to the calling . If you are hunting on private property or in an area where the buck to doe ratio is 1/3 or better the rules will change . You can be more aggressive and make more mistakes and they will not be as costly . I was watching the outdoor channel the other day ( ca n't remember wich program ) but this guy in texas was rattling and grunting constantly , I could n't believe how aggressive he was being and how constant he was doing it , but it was working very effectively . The ranch he was hunting though only allowed the taking of 2-3 deer a year though and the buck to doe ratio was 1/2 .

You can not escape the eyes of this planet.Religion out of religion is nothing but inherent greed to achieve control some how or the other.Earth was to be exploited and used so a GOD living away from Earth was discovered.Dividing the Earth into various countries and races is the biggest fault of mankind.In case reality of existance was to be the reality of GOD mankind discovered than mankind would not be on the brink of extiction.Air is polluted .water is running short search for another place in the skies is meaning less but only an effort to survive.It is movement of matter or interaction of matter with matter.Mind of mankind will be nothing without the properties of matter.Ever See my answer to your previous posting of the same question .,0

"Is the Spread Offense becoming the downfall of high schooll football , or is it becoming a whole new era ? A lot of really sucessfull college football teams are using the spread offense these days . Texas , Oklahoma , Texas Tech , Utah and West Virginia have all done well in recent years using it.So its natural that HS coaches would try to copy what is working at a college program . Also , if you are running this kind of offense in HS it would give your players a better chance at getting a college football scholarship . The college coach sees that the kid knows about the spread offense already so it would make him a better fit for that school then someone who knows nothing about it.Anyways , just my opinion , we ran the option in HS which I thought was fun but now there are only a couple college schools ( like Navy ) that run it anymore .",0
"why would a wife rather run with male friends than to spend time with her husband and family ? I have always worked hard and the jobs took me away from home alot . The last one I was mobilized to Iraq . Of which I was sent back home early due to a child custody problem . My wife had ( by power of attorney ) custody of my children from another woman . That woman showed up to the house and now I am here . Once all the military crap was completed and I was discharged from active duty , We had spoke about allof the above and she had stated that she felt confined . That she had no friends anymore . I tild her that she could go out with friends every once in awhile . That ended up to be every night m-th at a bar until it closed and f-sa at one ( a males ) house to play cards . For the most part I believe as such was going on , , , but now how can a male friend of hers who understands why I would chase after to find my wife and ask her to come home and not stay out all the time allow her to move in with him with our children.. ? ? ? It sounds like she has no respect for you and has no consideration for your feelings . Why would you want to be with a woman like this ? Would she be so understanding if you were spending your free time with another woman ? You need to take charge of the situation and put your foot down let her know that this is unacceptable behavior and if she refuses to put a stop to it you know that she is not the one for you . Ultimately the decision is yours do you want to live this way and if she is not looking out for your childrens best interest than maybe you need to .",0

"If Catholıc are donatıng a huge amount of money to charıtıes , why there always a NEWS of HUNGER ın the world Not all charities deal with hunger . The catholic church is a frequent location for the donations . The church has numerous employees at every church as well as support staff at the diocese level and at the Vatican . Most of these staff members are salaried while the Priests & etc have most of their expenses paid for through these donations . The staff members are to be treated like members of any business and receive pension and health care adding additional costs . Other costs that individual churches have include heating and cooling costs . If you think your heating bills are bad , think of a large building with lots of windows and doors frequently being opened.The church itself has numerous missions besides just feeding the hungry . Frequently churches have nurses on staff to visit the elderly home bound and others who may need help in administering special medication and can not afford nursing homes or a onsite nurse . There are frequently nuns on paid staff that visit the ill , the dying , etc . Some churches have other ministries as well depending on the local area . Catholics are also big on right to life and spend considerable resources attempting to deny people 's right to choose . They are also suppose to be opposed to the death penalty and also working against the archaic penalty but is nomally the work of a few individuals.All of these different things I have mentioned are just a few of the items that the church works on as well as hunger . That being said , Catholics are individuals and also give to other charities that they have personal interests in . From cancer research to colleges , it all stretches the dollar even further.Everywhere I have been , the protestants have tended to have much more open pocketbooks . It may have something to do with the silly notion that catholics have that every sperm is sacred and thus have more kids . The point is , everyone overlooks the most needy , not just Catholics .",0

"Do Photons have any mass ? ( explain ) ? if yes , so why the Photon 's mass does n't increase while moving in the speed of light.and if no , so why a Photon hits an electron , the electron starts moving and the lights frequence increases ? ? ? It is not possible to experimentally measure something to have a value of exactly zero . The current limit on the mass of the photon is < 10^25 times lighter than the proton.The idea of a particle 's mass changing with velocity has not been used by serious physicists for several decades . We now rewrite the momentum equation asmomentum = gamma*mass*velocity , where the factor gamma describes the effect previously known as `` relativistic mass '' .The energy of a particle is energy = gamma * mass * c^2 ( try setting gamma=1 for a stationary particle ) so we can write momentum = energy * velocity / c^2or momentum = energy/c for particles moving at the speed of light.So , even though a photon has zero ( or very small ) mass , it still has momentum , which it can transfer to an electron .",0

It 's been mathematically `` proven '' that you can get high returns AND reduce your risk by buying diverse high-risk investments which have no correllation.Also , Equities ( Stocks ) have had some of the best returns historically , and are still considered a very good investment.Of course you do n't want to be STUPID about it and buy the riskiest stuff possible . Get some AGGRESSIVE mutual funds with low fees ( Vanguard has some ) . Spread your money around to highly aggressive funds that have little correllation . For instance , some Domestic High Growth , some Foreign aggressive growth , maybe some Real Estate Trust Funds , some High Tech , Some Health Care.Look at the historic returns of the sector and the fund . Look too at the risk vs. return . If , as you say , risks do n't matter , then go for high return funds , with a reasonable risk . And spread it around - but make sure you spread it around to different TYPES of investments - all that are aggressive , but some that move contrary to each other ( like foreign vs domestic , or REITs vs Stock )",0

"do you believe in god ? I know there is a God . I did n't arrive at this conclusion by my intellect , for human intelligence is limited . Give up on trying to figure everything out , for common sense itself should tell you that you ca n't know or understand everything . This is not a matter of the head , but of the heart . Ask yourself this : `` If God is the truth , do I really want to know the truth ? '' Our sinfulness makes us afraid of a holy and righteous God who we feel must demand an accounting of us His creatures . Atheists say they do n't believe in God , but I do n't believe in atheists . If they do n't believe in God , then who are they so mad at ? They claim wisdom and knowledge and call believers simple , but I see atheists as being extremely smallminded and limited . Did atoms and microbes not exist until some human came along who was smart enough to detect them ? How small these people 's reality must be ! How futile and pointless their existence ! I commend you for at least being openminded enough to ask ? How foolish it is to think that one 's ignorance is evidence ! Thanks for not being that way , wisdom is not beyond the grasp of one such as yourself . There is a God ; He is beyond human comprehension ; He is absolutely holy , righteous , and frightfuly just . His awesome majesty and power is terrifying and he is completely unapproachable by vile , prideful humans . Remember I said that it is our innate sense of this reality that drives some to deny His existense out of fear of the truth . They ca n't face themselves and their guilt , and they ca n't face a righteously angry , holy , and just God whom they rightly think will demand retribution of them . What they do n't understand is that this same God is also infinitely loving , kind , gracious and merciful , and that He paid the penalty for their sins and removed their guilt which was keeping them from Him . How ? He gave us His only begotten Son Jesus Christ who took our sins and guilt upon his holy and innocent self and was put to death so that we may go free . Believe this , make claim to it as a FREE GIFT from God , confess it to Him and to others , then walk in peace from now on with Him , always trusting Jesus ' sacrifice as your justification in God 's eyes , not your own merit . Then keep on learning more of Him and growing spiritually. > < > Sir Brian",0

"I 'm want to be a game designer , but I 'm only 15 . What should I do ? A few things to consider : One , what part of game development interests you ? Broadly speaking , there are three roles involved in the development of games : Programmers - game developers , testers , and tools programmers . These are the people who do the actual work of building the game , and create the program that makes everything happen.Artists - 3d modelers and 2d artists and texturers . These are the people who create the `` look '' of the game - every object that appears on-screen has to be modeled , and the surfaces of the objects need to `` painted '' to resemble whatever they 're supposed to be.Designers - level designers , interaction designers and `` game designers . '' These are the people who figure out how things work , and create the `` feel '' of what it 's like to play the game . There ususally are n't many on a development team , and they often end up doing other organizational work , too.What to study depends on which of these sounds appealing . If you like the idea of game programming , then study how to program and practice writing code for fun . If art appeals , get a 3d modeler or 2d painting software and learn to create things with it . If you want to design , make sure you understand at least a little bit about programming and art , and practice your writing and speaking - designers need to be able to communicate.For all of these roles , learn to play videogames with a critical eye - when a game is n't fun , ask yourself why it is n't fun . When a game is , ask what succeeds about it . What could make it better ? A good way to learn about what makes games fun is to play and create board and card games - learning games as a whole , and being able to talk about them intelligently will be a big help.And , if you decide that gaming is n't for you later , then an education based around the fundamentals of design like that will leave you able to do quite a bit besides gaming.Good luck !",0

This also makes any offspring of her brother pauls her niece or nephew ( obviously ) . Jane is marys sister and so the same is true , she will be aunt to any of marys offspring hence we have the relationship Aunt and niece for both children to each other .

"Does anyone know anything about Linus Pauling any written work ? ? ? Pauling , Linus Carl ( 1901-1994 ) , American chemist and physicist , whose investigations into the structure of molecules led to discoveries of how chemicals bond.Pauling was born in Portland , Oregon , on February 28 , 1901 , and educated at Oregon State College and the California Institute of Technology . He began to apply his insights into quantum physics as Professor of Chemistry at the institute , where from 1927 to 1964 he made many of his discoveries . By devising techniques such as X-ray and electron diffraction , he was able to calculate interatomic distances and the angles between chemical bonds.During the 1930s Pauling introduced concepts that helped reveal the bonding forces of molecules . The Nature of the Chemical Bond , the result of these investigations , has been a major influence on scientific thinking since it was published in 1939 . Pauling also investigated the atomic structure of proteins , including haemoglobin , and discovered that cell deformity in sickle-cell anaemia is caused by a genetic defect that influences the production of haemoglobin . He was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work . In later years Pauling fought ardently against nuclear weapons testing , warning the public of the biological dangers of radioactive fallout , and presented a petition to the United Nations in 1958 signed by over 11,000 other scientists . In 1962 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , becoming the second person , after Marie Curie , to win two Nobel Prizes.Throughout his scientific career , Pauling followed his creative hunches , no matter how controversial they were . In 1970 , for example , he advocated large doses of vitamin C to treat the common cold—a belief , however , that few medical authorities have endorsed .",0

"Since reparations has been given due to past crimes against humanity should n't African Americans receive also ? Due to slavery and 400 yr+ of oppression also the unequal treatment of blacks in America due to White supremacy and injustice . Reparations in the United States have generally been limited to the survivors of government harm . Watch your terminology , though - slavery was not a crime until 1865 , since the government permitted slavery and only outlawed it through the Thirteenth Amendment after the Civil War.For instance , the United States paid survivors of Japanese internment programs from WWII . The program , however , was limited to survivors . No survivors of slavery exist today.A current reparations program would be too bizarre to fathom . All African-Americans were not harmed by slavery , after all , since some immigrated to America after slavery , or since some have no slave ancestors . It would be virtually impossible to require proof of slave ancestry , and then to divide some sum proportionately.Additionally , the vague `` 400 yr+ of oppression '' is unhelpful in crafting legislation . Slavery ended . Segregation did exist also , that 's ended for over 50 years now . If you 're problem with `` White supremacy and injustice , '' then I 'm afraid that no amount of money will solve the problem . Instead , educating future generations and winning over hearts and minds is the most effective remedy to injustice .",0

We are both single parents , we have similar values and she is more beautiful than I can possibly describe . It seems that any excuse we can make to get together we do but i do not know if it is because we are both really stressed out , if it is a friendship thing or what.I am very confused and have been balancing between being transparent and being coy trying to gauge her reaction.Do I just wait and see what happens or do I take the bull by the horns and just tell her ? Go for it . Take the chance . Cause she might have the same feelings and you do n't know it . Maybe she is waiting for you to say something . So like I said go for it , Tell her that you felt a connection . You wo n't know till you try it . GOOD LUCK !",0

"Have i screwed myself over ? If i slacked off for the first two years of highschool and failed a lot of classes , but now in my third year am making A 's and B 's have i screwed myself out of going to a good college like a University ? Not necessarily . Many colleges look at both your overall gpa and your last two years gpa . So , hopefully you will do very well this year and next year . Remember that you only have two more semesters to get grades before most applications are due ( you have this spring 's grades and next fall 's grades ) so it is critical that you do well . Remember , that gpa is one very important factor in admissions , but most colleges also want you to have high SAT or ACT scores , so you need to prepare for doing well on this test . You can study for it , and I like to have people study for it by buying a bunch of practice tests and taking a practice test a week for 8-12 weeks . Take a test , score it , and then look up every item you got wrong . Then repeat . You should see your scores improving.Finally , colleges really do want to see that you have some significant interests within and outside of school . So , you also need to show that you have leadership potential , or talent , or community impact . Clubs , hobbies , and community service can all be a part . Finally , you really need to be able to do a good personal statement . It probably would be helpful to address your poor grades , why you had them and what you learned about yourself so that you could turn it around . Be able to address your values and why you and the school you are applying to are a good match . Hang in there , do well , and remember that college applications are multifaceted .",0

"Why doeblowing on hot food cooli ? Why is it if we blow on hot soups or other food we tend to cool it a bit Temperatures of hot foods decrease as the foods steam ( therefore giving OFF heat , and retaining less heat ) . By blowing on the food we are ( 1 ) helping steam to whip away from the food faster and ( 2 ) adding our breath which is necessarily less hot than the heat of our food . It 's the same idea behind putting ice in a hot liquid , except our breath is n't as cold as ice . If it were , we 'd be running around causing all sorts of trouble .",0

"if u have constant acceleration but u double your speed , does distance needed to stop go up by a factor 4 or 2 physics problem , and also how do i calculate stopping distance ? The equations of motion you are using are good equations , but are n't going to answer your question . What you want to know is the energy of the moving object . The kinetic energy of a moving object is E = ( 1/2 ) m*v^2 . From this equation you can see that if you double the velocity , the energy quadruples . Stopping an object with four times the kinetic energy will take 4 times the distance .",0
"If someone becomes very ill with pneumococcus pneumoniae , but recovers , would this confer a lifetime immunity ? I believe that there are dozens of serotypes of pneumococcus .

If you 're in a high-risk group ( your immune system is compromised or you are elderly ) , a yearly vaccine would be a good idea .",0

"any one know the reason why people say 'bless you ' after you sneeze ? I do it all the time and have no idea why . THIS IS THE ORIGIN OF THE CUSTOM : In English-speaking countries , it is common for at least one person to say `` Bless you '' after someone sneezes . The traditional explaination for the custom is that it began literally as a blessing . Pope Gregory I the Great ( 540-604 AD ) ascended to the Papacy just in time for the start of the plague in 590 AD ( his successor succumbed to it ) . To combat the plague Gregory ordered litanies , processions and unceasing prayer for God 's intercession . When someone sneezed , they were immediately blessed ( `` God bless you ! '' ) in the hope that they would not subsequently develop the plague.This custom persists among speakers of many languages . Common social responses to sneezes in English include `` Bless you '' and `` Gesundheit '' ( German , `` [ Good ] health [ to you ] '' ) .",0

"I have a Buddhist question : are there any Buddhist solar adorations ? What are they ? I am certainly aware that there are `` solar '' aspects to all of the great spiritual teachings . For example , the Bible speaks of `` the Sun of Righteousness '' in Malachi & of a Davidic solar vision in Psalms 19 . The Hindu Gayatri mantra is solar ( a SPIRITUAL , internal Sun , not the one in the sky - this also has to do w/the passage of the seasons , marking time ) . The ancient Egyptians were certainly into our shining orb , not sure about Islam yet.My question is , what is the Buddhist contribution ? I know they believe that all spiritual entities are mere forms of `` Buddha consciousness '' , a primordial essence beyond time & space that is STILL not a `` God '' - that 's another form ! I ca n't find this on any of the Buddhist links I 've checked . Sorry for asking something so hard . The phrase Sun of Enlightenment is one ( see reference below ) . Look up references to the Sun-faced Buddha . This is another solar reference.Unlike many religions which attempted to swallow pagan worshippers , Buddhism accepted no outside dogma or symbols except as they enhanced the concept of the Path to Enlightenment . Many in the West have a very hard time understanding what this means .",0

I 'd wake up in the morning and feel completely exhausted.I was tested three years ago and was shocked to find out that I stopped breathing 30 times in three hours , which essentially woke me up . When the clinic stirred me , they put me on a CPAP ( controlled positive air pressure machine ) and I fell into deep REM sleep for the first time in I ca n't remember . Since then , I use the CPAP every night and sleep like a baby . You will , too.I ca n't stress enough the health implications of this beyond the lack of sleep . It is a severe drag on the heart and respiratory system.I ca n't speak to your financial issues , but medical insurance should cover this if your doctor makes the referral.According to my doctor , surgery has only a 35 % success rate . I did n't like those odds . My experience with Breathe-Rite strips was largely negative although they were helpful when I was at the gym ( - :",0

"Would frozen blood bullets really kill someone ? My first thought is it sounds great but it probably wouldnt work . However I am not scientific at all so I though maybe someone could offer me better insight.And maybe a reason why or why not ? In English or German , the answer would be the same . Although the bullet may not cause enough physical damage , there are other things to consider , including site of entry.Mythbusters never shot a live animal ( too much fuss for a publicly viewed TV show ) . If they had , they might have answered the question better . If shot into major artery , the vicitm would probably die of blood loss . I am not sure of what would happen if shot into the ear or the roof of the mouth . If the victim lived , it might never be the same.Unlike the water bullet , if the blood was the vicitm 's , I do not think this could be discovered . I loved the question .",0

They say divorce is like death . The processes of grieving are very similar . The only difference is that the one that you love is still alive and kicking . Take this time to examin what you want out of life . Appreciate this time alone and do things that you could not do when you were married . Enjoy the lack of nagging and complaining .

"box and whisker plots ? how do you pick out the numbers to use with a box and whisker plot when you have all the quartiles , and smallest and largest numbers ? A box-and-whisker plot can be useful for handling many data values . They allow people to explore data and to draw informal conclusions when two or more variables are present . It shows only certain statistics rather than all the data . Five-number summary is another name for the visual representations of the box-and-whisker plot . The five-number summary consists of the median , the quartiles , and the smallest and greatest values in the distribution . Immediate visuals of a box-and-whisker plot are the center , the spread , and the overall range of distribution . The first step in constructing a box-and-whisker plot is to first find the median , thelower quartile and the upper quartile of a given set of data . Example : The following set of numbers are the amount of marbles fifteen different boys own ( they are arranged from least to greatest ) .18 27 34 52 54 59 61 68 78 82 85 87 91 93 100 First find the median . The median is the value exactly in the middle of an ordered set of numbers . *68 is the medianNext , we consider only the values to the left of the median : 18 27 34 52 54 59 61 . We now find the median of this set of numbers . Remember , the median is the value exactly in the middle oa an ordered set of numbers . Thus 52 is the median of the scores less than the median of all scores , and therefore is the lower quartile.52 is the lower quartileNow consider only the values to the right of the median : 78 82 85 87 91 93 100 . We now find the median of this set of numbers . The median 87 is therefore called the upper quartile . 87 is the upper quartile ( *If you 're finding the median in an ordered set with an even number of values , you must take the average of the two middle numbers . For example : 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 . Add the two middle numbers . 5 + 7 = 12 . Divided 12 by 2 to get the average . 12 / 2 = 6 . Therefore 6 is the median for the ordered set of 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 . ) You are now ready to find the interquartile range ( IQR ) . The interquartile range is the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile . In our case the IQR = 87 - 52 = 35 . The IQR is a very useful measurement . It is useful because it is less influenced by extreme values , it limits the range to the middle 50 % of the values.35 is the interquartile rangeplease review these pages .",0
"Whats a girl to do ? I have just split up with my boyfriend more or less because of outside source/reasons.. and we agreeed that time apart would be best for right now . There have been other situations that we have gone through and taken a break and I would always be the one to call.. but this time I just felt as though I didnt need to call and to wait for him to call . SO , he called last night and we talked and he offered to go somewhere with me tomorrow and help me out with something and I was kinda hesitatant at first so he took it as me not wanting to . Which was fine with me , i just didnt want him to feel bad . The only reason I was hesitant was becase I didnt know if I was ready to see him yet . SO I called today and explained that to him . explained that I was only hesitant because I didnt know if I was ready to see hmi , but after our coversation I realized it would be fine to see him . Should I have just left it as it was , or the fact i called and explained myself ok ? Did I just make myelf too available ? If you like him and enjoy hanging out with him then talk with him and hang out . Guys are hard to understand and confusing . Just be honest and mature . Talk about how you are feeling and explain what you mean so he does n't take things the wrong way and same goes for you , if he says something that you do n't quite understand let him know . The way I look at things is that if things are meant to happen then they will . Do n't worry , just take it easy . Best of luck to you ! ! : )",0

"why is the sun yellow ? The sun is really yellow and if you were on a planet far far away and looked at our sun , depending on how far you really are ( faint stars are hard to make out period ) , you 'd see a star with a yellowish tinge.You can go out on your backyard on a clear night and see stars of various colors.Capella is a bright yellow star in Auriga , Betelgeuse is a red star in Orion , etc.Stars come in various colors : white , red , blue , yellow.You can mainly tell how hot a star is by its color : I believe the order is blue ( hottest ) , white , yellow , red ( coolest ) .Light is radiation , things at different temperatures radiate different wavelengths of light . You can see this in real life : A candle flame is yellow , but a blowtorch , which is much hotter , is blue.Color also gives astronomers an indication of how old the star is : Stars cool down as they age , so a red star would be very old and on its way to dyinng ( Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star , on its way out ) , while white and blue stars are more recently formed",0

"What is the best music creation software to use for a windows xp computer ? I want a computer program that lets me make new songs by adding beats and sounds and lets me make remixes to songs from my library on my computer . It depends on how much you want to program your own sounds verus leveraging pre-canned loops and samples culled from the songs you want to remix.I 'm still a big fan of Acid -- - Orignally from Sonic Foundry but now a product offered by Sony Music : http : //www.sonymediasoftware.com/products/acidfamily.aspAcid is excellent for working with loops -- it allows you to easily time-stretch loops and transpose them to work well with other loops culled from other sources . A lot of what makes people love Garageband ( Apple 's entry-level music software ) was first pioneered in Acid . The main limitation of Acid is that it has limited or no support for the creation of your own original sounds and sequences -- it 's more of a loop arranger.Another outstanding application is Propellerheads Reason 3.0 ( http : //www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/ ) Reaon gives you an entire virtual rack of synthesizers , samplers , and effects that you can intuitively connect with virtual patch cables . Every knob is designed to be twiddled in real time and the best thing is that all these modifications can be recorded for playback or fine-tuning.Finally , a third application you might want to check out is Ableton Live ( http : //www.ableton.com/index.php ? main=live ) Live is extremely popular among performing musicians today because it is optimized for live performance or on-the-fly creation/arranging of songs . The application is a bit like Acid in that it is mainly intended for working with building blocks of pre-created loops ( either instrument loops or sampled material ) with an interface and workflow that makes it very easy to add , subtract , and tweak stuff as the rest of the song plays back . Between the 3 applications I 'm sure you 'll find something that work for you . Best of all , you can download free trial versions of all applications to see for yourself . Happy remixing !",0

"As earth gains weight , will it affect its rotation on its axis and its revolution around the sun ? Will the contniuous weight gain of earth affect the orbits of other planets and our solar system as well as the entire universe ? If the mass of the earth changes , then if we could `` weigh '' it on a scale , its weight would change . Changing the mass of the earth definitely affects its rotation rate , and its orbit , as well as all the other orbits of bodies in the solar system , including the sun , and of course , bodies outside the solar system . All of the laws of motion and gravity that the earth and the other bodies obey depend on the mass of the earth.How might mass of the earth change ? 1 . The earth is gaining mass every year from meteorites of course . The amount of material falling to earth is estimated to be between 37,000 and 78,000 tons per year ( see first reference ) .I am not sure if this includes material from the solar wind , or from the tails of comets , or from cosmic dust ( see below ) which are also sources of material from space that the earth gathers , but I believe it does . 2 . The earth is also losing material because we are now launching satellites and sending space vehicles off on missions . 3 . At the boundary of the atmosphere and space ( the exosphere ) where air can escape into space . The amount of air that is lost depends on how fast the ions , atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere are moving . I have including a web page that discusses this below . 4 . When radioactive material decays , it can emit electromagnetic radiation ( gamma rays ) that carry off a tiny amount of mass . Some of these gamma rays might make it all the way out of earth 's atmosphere , but very few I would imagine . I am not sure how to estimate this . It would definitely have to be balanced against the flood of radiation that the earth is being bathed in by the sun and by cosmic rays . Without doing any calculations , I would guess that the earth is probably experiencing a net gain of mass every year , and this increases the force of gravity between it and all the other celestial bodies . It also will make it spin more slowly , as the moment of inertia of the earth changes . However , the gain is very small . From the figures above , the earth 's mass increases by roughly 10^ ( -15 ) per cent per year ; that is , the earth experiences a gain of about 0.000000000000001 % per year .",0

"What is the holyghost ? Holy Ghost is a play by Dr. Jon Tuttle , Playwright-in-Residence and Literary Manager at Trustus Theatre in Columbia , South Carolina , and Professor of English at Francis Marion University . Tuttle 's other works include Drift and The Hammerstone.The play explores the conflicts that result from clashes of myriad sectors of humanity . It is set in 1944 , in a camp in South Carolina for German prisoners-of-war , overseen by black guards who enjoy few of the liberties the prisoners do . While there , the prisoners are subjected to a secret governmental re-education program which , ironically , resembles Goebbels ' Nazi propaganda . One prisoner escapes , equipped only with the lines he ’ s learned playing the lead in a camp production of Abe Lincoln in Illinois , and chased by a black private who sees the pursuit as a quest for acceptance . Their dash across the American South explores the ironies and hypocrisies of the American mythos .",0

"Why are honey bees appearing outside at night , in the dark and cold ? Today is ( was ) December 23 . For the past week or so , I 've been finding honey bees outside my front door after sunset . I 'm in the Phoenix metro area , so it 's not freezing cold , but cool enough to kill these poor guys . I never see them during the day and I have nothing on or around my door to attract them . I thought bees did n't fly at night , but apparently they do . Anyway , I was out on my front patio until an hour after sunset tonight - no bees . I went out about 3 hours later and there were five bees . I just went out again and there are eight . ( Seven are dead . ) I 've looked at these carefully - they are normal honey bees , not ground-dwellers . Any ideas why ? I 'm mostly just curious , but I 'd also like to eliminate them so I can go out barefoot again ! It is possible these were drones . For bees September through December can be the beginning of a new cycle.I quote : '' The time of day that drones fly in search of a mate depends on many factors , such as the geographic location , day length , and temperature . Drones usually fly from the hive in large numbers between 11 a.m. and 4:30 p.m . Morning or early afternoon flights may last 2 or 3 hours . Later flights are shorter . When out of the hive , drones congregate in `` mating areas , '' which may serve to attract virgin queens . These areas usually are less than 100 feet from the ground and seem to be associated with land terrain . ''",0

"what are the complications of unrepaired severed flexor tendons ? Hello I severed the FDP tendon of my right pinky finger last May . I am an art student , an oil painter and was horrified by the procedure and typical results of the recommended surgery so I did not have it . My injury does not impair my abilities at all , however it can get painful sometimes ... I was wondering if I can expect more serious complications of leaving the tendon unrepaired in the future ? Dynamic splinting after flexor tendon injuries of the hand in childhood ] [ Article in German ] Fasching G , Schmidt B , Friedrich H , Mayr J.Kinderchirurgischen Abteilung , Preyersches Kinderspital , Wien.Ninety severed flexor tendons were repaired in 24 boys and 14 girls in a four-year-period at the Department of Pediatric Surgery in Graz . Mean age was 4.9 years . In 16 patients ( 42 % ) additional lesions were found . Direct repair was performed with modified techniques of Kirchmayr ( 23 ) or Kleinert ( 8 ) . In four fingers , flexor tendon reconstructions were carried out . Postoperatively , the dynamic Kleinert splint was used for early nonresistive motion , beginning on average on the second postoperative day . Intensive training of motion was performed in physiotherapeutic sessions during a mean period of five months , postoperatively . In five cases tenolysis was performed ; in one case a rupture of a sutured tendon had to be corrected . 27 patients ( 71 % ) with 42 injured fingers were followed-up on average 2.7 years after the operation . In accordance with the Buck-Gramcko classification , very good results were achieved in 37 cases ( 88 % ) , and a poor result in one patient ( 2 % ) . Atraumatic technique , dynamic splinting , consequent physiotherapeutic training by experienced physiotherapists , and well informed parents will yield excellent results after flexor tendon repair in the paediatric age group.PMID : 9746876 [ PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE ] ==================================================I read this and other pubmed articles on your condition and it seems to me that the younger you are , the better your chances of not having complications . Also , the splinting and stitch type is important . In all tendon repair , the zig zag cut with cross stitch seems prefered and the scaring is the main complication . Physical therapy to reduce and stretch scaring is as vital as finding the right doctor for the operation . If you choose not to have the operation , you can reduce your pain with physical therapy such as strengh training , and my favorite , nerve stimulation . Get a shoe box and fill it with rice , dry beans , bean bag beads or other small rounded material and run the injured hand through it for about five minutes three times a day . This increases the blood flow and stimulates the nerves . Its a good way to relax arthritic hands too.The tendons in your hand have little room for blood flow to aid healing . Hot parafin wax treatments help greatly to aid the opening of small capillaries.I injured my hand in a fall about 6 years ago and still have stiffness even after doing all of the above for a very long time . But then again , I am much older and have other ailments that interfere with my healing process.Good luck in what ever you decide to do .",0

"why does it feel good to kill brain cells ? should n't that feel bad ? First of all most of the substances that are widely believed to kill brain cells do not . They will however alter the chemistry of the brain . This is not to say that it 's good to do these things . It is mostly due to the anti drug histeria that began in the early 20th century . Most drugs were used as medicine in the early days . It 's when drug abuse occurs that it can be of such a detriment . You can do very real damage to your brain with some of the most widely used drugs available today , alcohol among them . But it is the inhalants that do the damage the fastest . They impart chemical compounds into the bloodstream instead of Oxygen . Thus the brain is robbed of its most vital element . Brain cells then die by the millions . The notion that you become brain damaged by using marijuana or opiates is a bit misleading . The balance of normal brain chemicals is altered , maybe forever , but they are still not killing brain cells . Cocaine is another drug commonly used . It effects the brain chemistry also , but is more damaging to the heart . It kills heart cells on contact in laboratory experiments . It may also be harmful due to the powerful solvents it contains as a residue leftover from its manufacturing process . If you are going to use these substances you should at least inform yourself as to the damage you 're doing to your body .",0

"How to test a prophet in the LAST DAYS - if he or she is true or a false ? See , i 'm newly converted and I read that GOD WILL POUR OUT HIS SPIRIT IN THE LAST DAYS on all flesh ? Is he gon na pour it on an unbeliever too ? since God says in `` ALL FLESH '' , your children will dream dreams and your daughters and sons will prophesy before the terrible day of God Almighty . So now , JESUS also made mention of FALSE PROPHETS . And our church has a prophet exclusively of their own.There has to be true prophets also in the Last DAYS as well with false prophets ... So which one is which ... ( Hope it 's OK i ask too many questions : ) hi.. First of all , I would like to congratulate you for choosing the way of Christ.I 'll try to answer your question to the best of my ability.I believe that when God speaks about All fleshin Joel 2:28 `` And i shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh ; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , your young men shall see visions . `` He meant the believers or someone who is being prepared for the Lord 's works.If you check sub chapters before that verse , God talks about A call to repentance and the land refreshed.The Lord obviously speaks about the people who repent and refreshed into the new creation in Christ ( believers ) .Thus , I conclude that All flesh , in Joel 2:28 , means All believersThat 's why it is important to always read at least a chapter or two before and after the verse.For the bible works as a whole ; we should avoid reading bible verses by chopping it individually . If we do that , there is a chance for us to take the verse out of the original context . And , yes there are still prophets appointed by God.and as it is true that there are true prophets , there are also false prophets/teachers.and your question is How we can tell the true from the false one , right ? there are 3 steps for us to know that a prophet is a false one or not:1 . God says `` My People perish from the lack of knowledge . '' It is very important for us to read the bible and pray everyday to build a sweet and intimate relationship with God . And also sharpen our knowledge about God 's characters.We know that Jesus has warned us about the false prophets/ messiahs in Matthew 24:24-28 . So , when there are news about messiahs that come to deliver us from sin , we knew that we have to be careful with those fake messiahs . We know in our heart that Jesus Christ is our only messiah that no one comes to the Father without going trough Him.2 . From reading the bible everyday and become more and more alert and sensitive to God 's voice , we knew that the true prophet sent by God will NEVER contradict the bible.So , when a teacher/prophets come to you and said that he is the messiah or something like you should divorce your husband , we know immediately that this prophet is a false teachers and should be avoided.Remember ! the bible is the ultimate guide that you should use to check whether a prophet is false or not.when they go against the bible , do n't waste your time.Pack your things and go.. Do n't bother listening to them.3 . What if the prophet looks and sounds fine for now ... but in the future , he will finally shown his true self . how do you know that he 's not going to trap you in his web of lies . For we know that the devil is cunning and deceitful.Well , go and look in matthew 7 : 15-20.It is okay and even recommended to test those people.Do n't accept them immediately just because they said they are prophets.Do n't be rude to them , but keep your Spiritual alert system on all the time.Test the fruits and the labors . For the things that came from the Lord always bring forth peace and goodness.Take whatever good and biblical inside . but , disregard the weird teachings . Keep alert and pray all the time for the Holy Spirit to reveal the truth to you about those prophets . Hopefully that helps , In jesus name , Amen",0

With love making ... ... .the feeling is so intense BECAUSE of the emotions involved . It feels good because of what it means between the two people involved . It is n't just an act of passion ... ..but passion in the act .",0
"how to make working habits in pupils ? Keep high expectations and build accountability into your system . Give them many real life examples of people who work very hard , especially to people that might appeal to your particular group of kids such as Kobe Bryant , or the richest man in the US , Bill Gates or whoever , because there 's a 99.9 percent chance that that they did n't get where they are without working hard . You know that a guy like Bill Gates put in very long days of hard work to get where he is at and most likely still does . I say things like , '' Do you think Kobe Bryant hardly practices or do you think he worked hard to be as good as he is ? '' There is a children 's book written by Michael Jordan 's family that also explains his childhood work ethic . I also give them an example of a family member of mine who is extremely smart , but has nothing to show for it because she is so lazy ( talent minus hard work ) . I think kids of all ages , no matter whether they are showing you or not , understand these examples .",0

"Do you think children have a preference for one parent over another ? I was observing kids and their parents in a public location . I noticed the little girls were walking hand in hand with their father and the little boys were walking with their mother . I was wondering if boys tend to gravitate to their moms , while girls gravitate to their dads . I think parents tend to have a natural protection type sheild over the opposite sex offspring . Like a daddy and his little girl , there is nobody who can come in between them until sweet sixteen when daddy 's cleaning the shotgun , while mothers want their sons to turn out to be men of honor that women will want while he still has respect . I feel children will gravitate towards the nicer parents because their minds are so simple they respond to the parent who is nicer . If you left a jar full of sugar in front of a 4 year old it would be gone in a matter of minutes because they do n't know any reason why they should n't eat it all . When a parent scolds a child the child is instantaneously resentful because they have no idea of the long term effects , does that make sence ? ?",0

"what is the chemical structure of the spider 's net ? The dragline silk of the Golden Orb-Weaving spider is the most studied in scientific research . Spider silk is a natural polypeptide , polymeric protein and is in the scleroprotein group which also encompasses collagen ( in ligaments ) and keratin ( nails and hair ) . These are all proteins which provide structure . The protein in dragline silk is fibroin ( Mr 200,000-300,000 ) which is a combination of the proteins spidroin 1 and spidroin 2 . The exact composition of these proteins depends on factors including species and diet . Fibroin consists of approximately 42 % glycine and 25 % alanine as the major amino acids . The remaining components are mostly glutamine , serine , leucine , valine , proline , tyrosine and arginine . Spidroin 1 and spidroin 2 differ mainly in their content of proline and tyrosine .",0

"why should aperson lose their job for forgeetting to turn in money that they are told to keep in their pockets My daughter was a very dedicated employee at Dayton International airport , went to work on her off days just to help out , did whatever her job duties call for her to do , a very repectful young lady that spent six year in the US Army . Nine months in Iraq . She was fired from the airport because they are told to keep money that they collect from customer in their pocket until the end of the day , instead of having a cash box for them to put the money in as soon as they collect it . She forgot she had the money in her pocket three times and took the money home ; therefore they fired her . Although she took the money back each time . She had been working there for one year and that is all they could find to fire her for . She really need her job she have a 4 year old daughter that she is raising . She have bills each month . it 's a shame when young people choose to get out and work and not be on public assistant to get fired for something like that . it 's hard to find jobs . I think it 's sad that your daughter lost her job at the aiport , she sounded like a very dedicated employee willing to go the extra mile even on her days off . But it is probably best she is no longer there because what you are describing here is that she was probably long past exhaustion each time she accidentally took the money home , although I am certain the airport did n't consider this when they decided to fire her.On the WHY part of your question : When she first was employeed by the airport she probably signed an agreement of `` if I mishandle money in any way that is n't in agreement with the airports rules , I understand that is grounds for dismissal '' If she agreed to these terms and broke them , is was their call to be understanding or not . They were 2 times before , but when they see a pattern of it , they are less likely to trust their money is safe . They will protect themsevles before protecting her.I agree they should n't make it so easy to leave your shift without turning the money in first . Just like with waiters and waitresses , or bartenders that most of the time must carry change on them , if the airport had an end shift report to do before each employee was allowed to leave , then it could all be resolved . I do n't know any waiters or waitresses that can leave for the day without giving the company their money first , along with reporting their tipped earnings for the day.Her honesty in giving the money back is something to be proud of , and she should n't hold bad memories against the airport for their descision . She made a mistake , we all do that once in a while . She 'll find another job , and she will have this experience to learn from .",0

"Miami Dolphins perfect season ? In what year did the Miami Dolphins have thier perfectseason , and what team will likely be the next to do it .

"Intel Pentium Processor upgrade ? I have a Compaq Presario 3020 Desktop PC with Intel Pentium processor ( 166 MHz ) . I would like to know if I upgrade the processor and put in a faster one ? And if so , what processor ? Also how do I open ( take the cover off ) the Compaq Presario 3020 Desktop PC ? You could upgrade the processor . The highest processor you can upgrade to is a Pentium 233 MMX ( the last model before Intel moved to the Pentium II format ) . It 's not much of an upgrade but it 's up to you if it 's worth the time to learn how to do it . Money should n't be a probably as the 233 MMX probably goes for $ 5 or less on ebay or some flea market.To open the Presario case , there are probably some screws on the left hand side in the rear ( when looking directly at the front ) . They secure the left panel to the case and consists of two ( maybe three ) screws . If you tug at the left panel by pushing it towards the back and it still does n't open , it might be a U-shaped cover and you 'll need to unscrew the screws on the right panel on the rear . Again , this may vary as different vendors had different ways to take the cover off .

"does muscle really weigh more than fat ? my daughter and i have a debate on this ? yes muscles weigh more than fat here is why ... .Muscle weighs more than fat because muscle cells that compose muscle are denser than fat cells . Why is this ? Because fat cell cytoplasm contains mostly oils ( lipids ) , whereas muscle cell cytoplasm contains mostly contractile proteins ( myosin and actin ) suspended in an aqueous ( watery ) environment . Lipids in general are less dense than water . You can prove this by mixing salad oil with water in a bottle and shaking it . Eventually , the oil will separate from the water and float to the top to form a lighter layer floating on top of the water . This lowered density of lipids make fatty tissue less heavy than muscle .",0

Sipping throughout the day should be the worst as you keep the teeth covered constantly .

In between chew gum or eat some other stuff that neutralizes the sugar and acid . I would also talk to a dentist first , as she can better judge how vulnerable your teeth are .",0

"How far will the Cincinnati Bengals go this football season ? This really all depends on how well the Cincinnati Bengals handle the pressure of the playoffs and how well the defense plays . Cincinnati Bengals rank 11th in total rushing yards , 6th in total passing yards and 4th in total Offense yards . Making them among the best offensive teams in the NFL today and the team is still young and learning how to work with each other.On the other hand the defense has been a nightmare . Only good thing going for the defense is the fumbles recovered and interceptions they have made this year , which plays a big role in why they are where they are now . The defense has allowed a total 1522 rushing yards , allowed 2735 passing yards and are ranked 24th in the NFL overall in yards allowed.In order to get to the SuperBowl the defense must step up and make the big plays , there is no room for error in the playoffs . I think they can get the 2nd seed in the AFC , with games left with only one team that has a winning record and good team . The other two games are against the coachless Lions and the Bills who are both no where near the playoffs . I like the Cincinnati Bengals chances of going to the SuperBowl and winning it , just do n't bet on it , unless the defense comes to play .",0

That is why you are more likely to have headaches . Some headaches are n't physical but rather psycho - somatic . It has been found in psychology , that if you feel stressed about something , or you feel guily about an emotion you should n't experience , it might easier be translated into physical terms , such as headaches , neckaches , etc.Plus , if want to know about sex , I assume you have n't experienced it much before . That is a kind of imbalance that may affect people differently.The key to solving both your study problems , and your sex curiosity appears to be simple , relaxation . One question you should ask yourself , how often do you let yourself go , relax . Some people find it to be the greatest aspect of sexual satisfaction , a kind of relief , feellings of floatiness , etc . Maybe unconsciously your body knows what you want , more even than you do , and prods you in that direction , of completely giving in to relaxation.But that is just an opinion , your medical health provider might know more.Hope that helps .",0

"I am 21 so why do n't i have regular periods ? Hormonal imbalances . Usually caused by diet . If you are too thin , you may not have enough body fat - it 's actually the cholesterol in your body ( fat ) that is used to make estrogen . Fatter women tend to look `` softer '' or more feminine.Estrogen is used to make the lining of your uterus that you shed every month.But progesterone is used to coagulate the lining so it sheds at a regular time period . It 's released after the egg is released , so it gets higher just before your period . Certain foods can interfere with the balance of estrogen and progesterone . Soy foods are particularly high in estrogen and can throw things off balance . Progesterone is also released from the adrenal glands , which also release cortisol - a stress hormone . Too much stress makes the adrenals concentrate on releasing cortisol and not on progesterone . Again , things get out of balance.Try to eliminate soy products ( and they are everywhere - most `` vegetable oils '' are soy oil ) and see if that helps . Do some deep breathing and meditation to relax and reduce the cortisol levels .",0

"What exactly is a black hole ? A blackhole is a collection of matter with gravity so immense that nothing can escape how strong the pull of it is unless when you are in it 's pull you can accelerate faster than the speed of light and beyond , thus the blackhole swallows up light as well.What happens is large masses collapse under their own weight . Think of a house of cards . The more you pile on , the greater the weight becomes until the cards on the bottom ca n't take the weight anymore . When the house of cards falls , the cards still exist but have lost their structure do to gravity.Now instead of a house of cards , replace that with an enormous sun that has tons of matter inside . The sun is teetering on the brink of collapsing as the matter inside grows and grows until eventually , like the house of cards , it falls down . Except since this is a sphere in space is is being pulled inward by it 's onw gravity , and not down like earth gravity , the sun does n't fall down , it falls IN.When this does happen the gravity does n't stop existing because the matter does n't either , it becomes smaller and the gravity grows as it pulls larger and larger amounts of matter into it 's core . Eventually it because so dense and so massive and so small that the gravity involved will not allow even Photons , or light particles , the fastest thing in the universe to pass through it.There ya have it !",0

"Could inteligent life have evolved from a different animal group , such as reptiles , birds or even insects ? Does higher intelligence ( such as humans have ) require some quality that only mammals have ? The fact that female mammals produce milk for their young means that at birth a mammal can have a relatively large brain , although they are relatively helpless . Other animals have to be able to at least get around.Brains do n't grow as much as other parts of the body , which is why babies seem to have large heads.The obvious counter-example is birds , where the young are stuck in the nest and depend on their parents for food . However , flight puts a limit on how heavy a bird can be , and so how heavy its brain can be . But flightless birds are a possible candidate.Amphibians and reptiles are cold-blooded , which seems as though it would rule out our sort of intelligence . On the other hand , perhaps an intelligent crocodile would think of slowing down when the temperature drops much as we think of sleep . Remember that a large brain would mean a large egg ( and you have to fit the rest of the body inside the egg as well ) .",0

"What are the rules of the basketball game ? basketball , game played generally indoors by two opposing teams of five players each . Basketball was conceived in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith , a physical education instructor at the YMCA college in Springfield , Mass. , as a way to condition outdoor athletes during the winter months . His original list of 13 rules has undergone a century of revision , leading to faster pacing and greater athleticism . Today basketball is one of the most popular American sports and one the rest of the world has adopted.Basic RulesAt each end of the court—usually about 92 ft ( 28 m ) long and 50 ft ( 15 m ) wide—is a bottomless basket made of white cord net and suspended from a metal ring , 18 in . ( 46 cm ) in diameter , which is attached 10 ft ( 3.05 m ) above the floor ( usually hardwood ) to a backboard made of fiberglass , wood , or other material . Players may throw , dribble ( bounce ) , or shoot the basketball ( an inflated ball usually made of leather or rubber ) but may not run with it or kick it.Teams try to advance the ball and shoot it through one basket ( the ball must enter from above ) and to keep the opposition from scoring through the other . Each field goal , or basket , scores two points , or three points if shot from beyond a specified distance ( 21 ft/6 m in U.S. colleges , slightly longer in international and professional play ) . Teams must shoot the ball within a prescribed time limit ( 24 sec in the National Basketball Association ; 30 sec in international games and in most women 's play ; 45 sec in men 's collegiate play ) .Any player making illegal body contact with an opposing player is assessed a foul ; the opposing team may be given possession of the ball , or an opposing player awarded free throws at the basket from the foul line . Each made foul shot is worth one point . Players who exceed the foul limit ( usually five , but six in the NBA ) are disqualified from the game . International and collegiate basketball games have two 20-min halves , professionals play four 12-min quarters , and high schoolers play four 8-min quarters .",0

Of course , various individuals within the American government , as well as larger entities within the government have gotten away with crimes . Check out the story of Ruby Ridge . Sara Weaver war murdered by FBI agent Leon Horiuchi 's sniper fire , as she stood on the doorstep with baby in her arms . The FBI also murdered one of her sons and killed the family dog . The government had to pay Randy Weaver 1.5 million dollars for this fiasco , but the government murderer Leon Horiuchi could never be prosecuted . Similar events happened at the government massacre of innocent civilians at the Branch Davidian church at Waco , Texas . Attorney General Janet Reno and ultimately Bill Clinton , were responsible for those murders , but they and all under them were never prosecuted . Our founders knew that government was a beast which would always grow in power and corruption and tyranny , unless seriously counterpoised by an armed and freedom loving people . Thomas Jefferson said the tree of liberty must be watered from time to time by the blood of patriots and the blood of tyrants . Our second amendment rights and inalienable God given rights to keep and bear arms , has been continually eroded by unconstitutional antigun laws . The people have been brainwashed by the government propaganda centers ( public schools ) that the government is our saviour , and that our rights come from the government , not from God , as the Declaration of Independence so clearly stated . Check out JPFO ( Jews for the Preservation of Firearm Ownership , Aaron Zelman 's group ) , which is the strongest gun rights group . The NRA is nothing but compromising antigun hypocrites.Alex Jones and some others believe that 911 was a conspiracy by the illuminati . Hard to tell . But certainly , if passengers on board those airlines had been able to exercise their constitutional right to keep and bear arms , such a thing could n't have happened . I will not fly if I ca n't take my gun . I will not be subjected to unconstitutional searches getting on the plane like some slave dog . I am a free american . The Patriot Act and similar legislation shows that the government is far more interested in using 911 and similar incidents to attack our rights , rather than to go after the enemy .",0

"Well i like this guy , and i think he likes me , but supposedly he 's just a really nice guy , what do i do ? Please help me , i have no clue what to do ! Guys are clueless ( at least I was ) . I had many women friends in high school and college that I thought were just friends . Only later did I find out that some of them wanted to be more than just friends.Sometimes a guy is just trying to be friends because he thinks that is the best way to start a relationship ... by being friends.I definitely had my `` dog '' days but I genuinely liked women as friends.So , as the first poster suggested , get to know him . Depending on your age , try just hanging out with him and talking to him . He 's not some alien from another planet . Guys often like women who can talk to them.Try group activities that involve him or casual things : tennis , a hike , bowling , coffee , ice cream , lunch.Get to know him and let him get to know who you really are . Do n't change to please him . Be yourself.And if you find yourself getting along really well , who knows where it will go . He may be your first kiss . You may find out he 's not interested in women or girls.But the first thing you have to do is to put yourself on his radar . And do n't expect things to happen `` over night '' .Good luck .",0

What ports need to be open on a firewall to run the MSN/YAHOO/ICQ/AOL Messengers properly ? You do n't want to open any port you do n't have to . Most IM applications are smart enough to use any open port . This is why it 's very difficult for network engineers to block IM using firewalls . Please be aware of the dangers of using IM . Make sure you take the necessary precautions . See the paper at http : //www.adventuresinsecurity.com/Papers/Securing_Instant_Messaging_2006.pdf,0
"Is it okay to talk on your cell phone , when you are dining at a nice restaurant ? It is rude . It is rude to the person with whom you are dining , it is rude to the other patrons , it is rude to the waitstaff . Unless you are a medical professional on call , a lawyer waiting to hear that the jury is ready to hand down a verdict or awaiting word that someone close to you is in labor , there is nothing that is so important that you can not turn off the phone for an hour and check your voicemail after the meal and away from the table .",0
