The Chinese Police Network, in a telegram, at15:19:50 p.m. February 12th, reported that an earthquake of M7.3 hit Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in Yutian County. The Yutian County Public Security Bureau asked for timely information and collected rescue methods for post-earthquake relief. The earthquake happened in Azan Township, Yutian County. The epicenter was located in the inner part of the Karakorum Mountains, about 50km far away from the Township Government. After the earthquake, the Yutian County Public Security Bureau immediately took a ""Preliminary Plan for relief against disaster"" and cooperated with the Azan Township Public Security Bureau to determine whether there were fatalities. It was reported that the quake was strongly felt in four villages nearest to the epicenter including Pishigai Village, Tar Egiz Village, Tugman Beshi Village and Azan Village. The police also arranged for people to carry out the rescue work in those four villages. According to the latest report, there have been more than 350 houses destroyed in varying degrees, more than 260 sheepfolds collapsed and three sheep died, as of now.

"I think that if our Earthquake Administration had been able beforehand to do a simulation of big earthquakes on this Longmenshan mountain earthquake belt, then on that day of May 12, once the Earthquake Administration had measured the quake at a magnitude of 7.8, we would have been able to broadly judge the extent of damage and destruction in the earthquake disaster zone. If the simulation program was well designed, circumstances like debris blocking roads, heavy rainfall obstructing parachute drops, power and communication outages should all have been within expectations. Instead in this instance the Liberation Army headquarters emergency contingency plan obviously was not a contingency plan designed with earthquakes as the assumed condition, as the soldiers all rushed straight to Wenchuan, without immediately sending out troops in the direction of badly-hit areas Beichuan, Qingchuan and Gansu's Longnan; only 24 hours later was the full extent of the disaster area taken into consideration. In addition, the breakdown in communication also brought a serious problem to the surface. In the past, Red Army regiments were able to maintain contact with central headquarters by relying on just one battered radio. On this occasion though, people had no way to deal with the communication failure. It is clear that preparations prior to the event were not constructed on the basis of an earthquake disaster simulation",1

"Ever since the earthquake disaster, the TV stations have been broadcasting the quake zone situation 24/7, and apart from being moved by the Liberation Army, more than that I feel regret that the people in the disaster zone have not been properly mobilized. There are many youths in the disaster zone idling by the wayside, or watching on as the Liberation Army carry out rescues, or just sitting on the ground with nothing to do. Is that because these guys are not concerned? No, the point is that no Party organization has rounded them up efficiently and formed them into a rescue force. Right now, with only regular army troops going into the disaster zone, a lot of large equipment is stuck on the roads, progress is painfully slow. With these kinds of geological conditions, why not fully organize the people, breaking them up into small groups to disperse throughout the disaster zone? If the main routes are blocked, take smaller roads. If the smaller roads are blocked off, take the mountain roads. The local population ought to best understand the lie of the land. It shouldn't be much of an issue to organize a few more people together, find guides and get into the disaster zone. When the Liberation Army can't enter the disaster area en masse, the most effective approach would be the onsite organization of the population for quake relief, or mobilizing the inhabitants of surrounding settlements not badly affected by the disaster, marshalling them together in the quickest possible time and making haste for the rescue effort front line",0

How can they move into new houses? The worst place of corruption is in the south of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region.

"An organizations statement issued by TPLF the EPRDF leaders, using a pretext language and cover of development that doesn't make its basis the people's benefits, and leaves aside the interest of citizens, and to elongate the time of their authority and following the announcements that doesn't represent the people, and so that the people will not demonstrate carrying the question of rights, and for the EPRDFites to rain on the people with bullets bearings in manners worse than the previous regimes. have counted a quarter of a century. because of these evil deeds, inflicting on the people leaving aside what can be considered heavy financial and material loss, the lives of considerable number of innocent compatriots in this country has been wasted. In recent weeks the cities' masterplan announcement that occupational regime had earlier issued, without first talking with the people, it has embarked on implementing in immediately in the surroundings of Addis Ababa and Finfine and some other towns of Oromia, without any explanation or observation, what followed was in the Haremaya University; in the towns of Lekemte, Adama, Assela, Ambo town, University of Ambo, Gimbi and other towns, have opposed the masterplan and went on demonstration against the illegal masterplan that doesn't confirm the benefit of the people. To quell the unrest that started to stop this movement that is directed against the benefits of the people, the step taken by the regime's security forces who used force killed with bullets innocent university students and peaceful people, have become exposed to wounding and arrest and The Tigrai Peoples' Democratic Movement TPDM strongly condemns it. Dear Ethiopian people this situation that has not be resolved, the broad opposition that has started against the EPRDF, has crossed the nationals of the Oromo region and has reached beyond the control of the regime, and has been able to expand to other regions and towns. Though such views and sentiments that doesn't make the people its center is broadly being carried out by the regime on the people of Tigrai, to prevent the people of Tigrai from finding its voice and to talk and not to oppose, if they were not reigned on and oppressed, it is know the people of Tigrai would not find benefit of interests from other Ethiopian brethren, therefore it is important to realize the EPRDF regime doesn't represent the people of Tigrai. And it should be clear to anyone that such feeling of the people that is difficult to suppress will explode in a short time and bring about a lasting solution and the suffocation that is hovering over the people by the EPRDF regime that doesn't have any delegation of the people and is the root cause of all the problems, can stop only when it is removed from power. Our dear people, the anti EPRDF movements that you are carrying out believing in this truth and seeking change, we remind you to strengthen your unity and to continue, the Tigray peoples' Democratic Movement TPDM is on your side in any form of struggle that you conduct and makes it knows that it will provide help that is required to do that. The Bomb explosion that happened at the Anwar mosque in Addis Ababa while our innocent Muslim believer citizens were performing Friday prayer and the serious and light damage it caused, even if it is a result of the anti-people occupational regime, the Tigray peoples' Democratic Movement condemns such sad incident from being repeated.

The company immediately made a decision to donate a million. People were satisfied with the promptitude of their action. Afterwards, Tencent also increased its donation to RMB 10 million in view of the development of the situation, becoming one of the Internet enterprises making the largest donations to the earthquake disaster area. At the same time as this, each of Tencent's main platforms began to call on web users to make donations, and the integration at the same time of Tenpay and Tencent's welfare platform took place as a result of this. Users could not only support the disaster zone by making donations; they could also get published on Tencent's platform by writing articles to express their own friendly wishes for the people of the disaster zone.

"Women's right has no approval by EPRDF!! Even though everybody believes women are half part of our society, but because of the previous dictator leaders of our country they cannot participate and benefit equaly from the political,economic and social life of the society and also do not get democratic rights or opportunities to express their problems with their own voices. To unload the adversity from their shoulder as all oppressed Ethiopian citizens our country's women, particularly the Tigray region women, join the 17 year army struggle and sacrifice their lives to assure and gain democratic rights,social justice, equality,peace and economic development of our country. For that reason, our country's women participate in all section of the combat during the armed struggle to get their rights and the rights of underprivileged people by resisting all natural and man-made obstacles. They joined the battle alongside their fighters and sacrificed. By giving their forehead to the bullet and tread explosives by jumping to the front battle field were able to be called lioness of the struggle. Even though, our Ethiopian women particularly the Tigray region pay spectacular effort by sacrificing their lives to reach into their goals,because their reward of struggle and sacrifices have been hijack and betrayed by the TPLF,EPRDF party, and their achievements which cost the hereon blood has been wasted, nowadays they are exposed to miserable lives. Women-the half part of society isolated alone cannot be beneficiaries; apparently, as every underprivileged Ethiopian society who was not able to get his reward of the17 years bitter and miraculous battle. Therefore, as all part of the society and women are loaded with many problems on their shoulder and their life fall in to famine,illiteracy,rape, detention,migration,adversity and death by the atrocity,horrible,rule of the TPLF, EPRDF ruling party. As a result of the human right violation and unemployment being an obstacle to women's social life,those who failed to resist the situation headed their way to migration blindly. As a result they became victims of rape and disgrace in the wild, or at the sea in a dreadful manner. The regime uses different systems to be trusted by the women. By systematic preaching in the name of union, league,women's federation, Meles leadership training academy etcetera and trying to control the women under his cruel and dictatorial administration and halt them from fighting for their future rights through writing, organizing themselves and incite argument against the dictators. The bloody and bitter army struggle performed to pervade justice, peace, democratic right, equality, and respect was jilted before reaching its goals as it falls to benefit the few elites, the oppressive, corruptive elite administration. The people and country are in danger of disaster and violence loss of integrity which resulted many innocent people being killed in the street and many other nationals are hunted get detained and tortured by security forceswithout any reason.Thissituationescalates grief and pain of our mothers and sisters. Because women are all the social life of community Looking at the threat and cruelty experienced by the ruling EPRDF party for the whole society especially women for 25 years, currently there is no hope that democratic right be secured.Therefore, we should unite and eliminate our sexual divergence and start the army struggle for democratic rights and abolish the ruling dictatorial EPRDF part",0

"Deaths in the Mediterranean have reached a climax. In 2016, the number of refugees who died trying to cross to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea surpassed 5000 people, a record number. Compared to this, the number of those who managed to set foot on the European coast, especially after the closure of the Eastern part of the Mediterranean that includes the route crossing from Turkey to Greece, has decreased by two-thirds. The number of deaths reached 5000 after two boats sank on December 22, near Sicilia on the Italian coast. The Italian coast guards could not rescue more than 100 of the 257 passengers on the two boats. The spokesperson of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, speaking about the devastating accident, said that the 2016 figure shows that every day an average of 14 people were dying in search of a better life in Europe. According to the UN branch attending to refugee affairs, as the type of boats that the smugglers use went on getting worse, the system that they pursue to avoid being caught also became more sophisticated. In 2016, the system that the smugglers used to avoid being caught involved sending too many boats at once, which made rescue missions difficult and caused the largest number of deaths. Theis big increase in the number of deaths that occur in the Mediterranean happened during a year when the minimum number of people who actually reach Europe has declined sharply. According to the International Organization for Refugee Affairs, in 2015 about one million refugees reached European shores, while the total for 2016 is only 360,000. Compared to the number of refugees who have flown to Europe, the number of people who have died in the Mediterranean has increased by a third. In 2015, over 3,770 refugees were lost, while in 2014 about 3,280 died. Compared to the pre-2016 record flow of refugees and death tolls, deaths at sea in 2016 increased three times over. The actual number of deaths is estimated to exceed the reported ones. The International Organization for Refugee Affairs says that hundreds of deaths that occur during the crossing from Morocco to Spain are mostly left unreported. Apart from the unreported deaths at sea, the accurate count of the refugees lost during journeys across the Sahara in 2016 reached at least 1,100",0

"He was born into a rich peasant family. In 1949, 20 Cambodian youth won scholarships to study in Paris (Cambodia was a colony of France at that time). Among them was a peasant's son named Saloth Sar, also called Burbutie (though his family didn't know it, he was called Burbu as well. From the year of 1975 on, the name Burbu would be very famous in Cambodia). After he came to Paris, Sharlut Zhao made contact with students who had come to Paris previously, and invited them to join the <Cambodia students' union>. During this time, he studied Marxism and Leninism, and formed his views on social democracy. In 1950, Sharlut Zhao established the <Cambodia communist party>. In 1956, he went back to his country and engaged in underground activities against the French colonial regime. Later on, he gradually enhanced his activities, and in 1976, he overthrew the pro-American government. After that, Vietnam would occupy most of the country in the course of the war between Cambodia and Vietnam. In 1997, Burbu was sentenced to life imprisonment and died of an illness in 1998. Earlier, the Langno group had overthrown Sihanouk with the help of America. In 1975, Burbu had ordered the whole country to start a revolution, which overthrew the Langno group.

"Press release May 25th, a day in which Eritrean refugees drowned in the Mediterranean Sea, and Independence day was celebrated. Day 1, two (2) weeks ago, we, Eritreans at home and abroad, observed the day the country was liberated, remembering the brave martyrs and the blood they sacrificed. Our country, Eritrea, was liberated from foreign colonization on May 24, 1991. It was celebrated by the Eritrean people all over the world. However, the way it was celebrated varies. Most Eritreans celebrated it by remembering in grief and praying for those heroes who passed away to bring Independence; by remembering the devastation that came after Independence and the continuing cataclysm, the heinous and reprehensible interrogations and killings inside the country, particularly in prison camps; remembering our innocent Eritrean brothers, victims of human trafficking, who are losing their lives in the deserts of the Sahara and Sinai, and the death that has been taking place in the merciless waters of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Its main message, however, was enough of our death; to ensure peace, to solve our problems, let's dialogue and erase our enemy. Our meetings proceeded by remembering the more than 300 Eritreans who died in the sea on Lampedusa",0

"My passionate tears, which I have held in my eyes, always shake my heart as if to make my feelings intoxicated. I cannot describe such feelings of mine anymore. There was indeed an earthquake. The epicenter of the 7.3-magnitude earthquake was in a deserted area that is located more than 100 kilometers away from the downtown of Keriye and dozens of kilometers away from Atchan village. In addition to that, considering the 7.3 magnitude strong quake, because the earthquake occurred during the daytime and the area is sparsely populated, and many were at work instead of being at home, except for those collapsed houses (about 50 to 60 houses collapsed) and the death of few livestock, there was no greao loss. The old town of Keriye County, which is continuously being mentioned in websites, is a special zone of Keriye County that was the earliest residential area where the traditional Uyghur sedentary culture has been preserved, similar to the streets of Old Kashgar. Here houses were adjacent to each other and the area is heavily populated, in addition to the existence of numerous old houses. For this reason, it's easy to say that some houses in this area might have been damaged by the quake. If so, what types of houses are they? Simply say, they are the houses that were damaged during the quake. The most shocking factor is the age of the houses. Some of them might be 50 to 60 years old while some of the newest ones would be 8 years old. There still might be some houses that are about 5 years old",0

I would rather curse your weightless verses cold like Germans and like the castle Kafka was not able to get in than praise you, oh Perhat Tursun. I laugh at the smiley poor guys and stop suddenly after that... you made me look bad to the world. You poured the condom in the Tarim river into my brain. Why did you change the pattern of Uyghur poetry that always praises others? Who wants to sit next to you if you do that? You make me turn into a pious man and I am afraid of thinking about you as if I fear water. I am in the hospital because of this serious paradox. Of Perhat Tursun , you created my heart condition. I would understand a little bit if it is a gloomy poem but this looks like a foggy poem. He lived as who he was, didn't he? I liked it. Anybody want to play paradox? Let's play paradox, come on, if you are not concerned about being mentally ill. Let me keep doing. How to call this? Is that a poem? muhlis0998 23:21 5-1-2016 posted time Anybody want to play paradox? Being a mental patient ... You begin first and let's work together if it is ok Of Perhat Tursun , you created my heart condition. The last part is greatly composed. I wish more success for Yarghol's writing. For the readers: Yarghol, look at the parts of the works that you felt unnecessary and what is there is the absolute world you will definitely go to very soon. Learn the difference between word and talk. Just stick with the word and undress limitlessly in the desert of the meaning. Trust the poet who does not stay in the destination. He more and constantly talk about sex, darkness, and death Writer, it might be you that he was cursing. Keep away for what you got used to and who you love. Turn your eyeballs into poisonous arrows and your aim to shameless praises. You should understand that you can learn nothing from us. Dive into our colors and blossom up in our voices and white bushes but forget us for the significance of us. Something like that, Yarghol , I am afraid of something and anxious about something. I feel myself lonely like the moon and powerless like the widowed aunty in the village. Although I know poets die without seeing morning light, I still seek comfort from the verses about lights. I am satisfied with lying and betrayals. Please come, sell me slowly and sneakily. Block the sun that is not straight ever and take my bulky ethereality. Flame my last myths. If my inner organs did not resist the nights and my anxiousness did not warm up January, my stone like hard debts, an unknown someone did not step down on my shoulder, how my life would become miserable. I also feel myself extra like an abandoned gland and feel myself passionate like winter birds. I love the world with some kind of poor emotion... and I believe that is a betrayal for the soul writing poems in this time. I wait for something and seek comfort from something. Maybe I expected a death or a life after the death..",0

"Athlete Feyissa Lelissa shall not return home believing the word of the government, his family said The government of Ethiopia promised that Athlete Feyissa Lelissa won't face any problem if he returns to Ethiopia despite his gesture of opposition against the government when he finished second place in the Olympic marathon race. His family warned that he shouldn't rely on the statement of the government and return to his country. Athlete Feyissa Lelissa made an arm gesture making a cross sign to express his solidarity with the Oromo people at the finish line and won the silver medal in men's marathon. The Oromia region is experiencing months of protest related to land and human affairs. Athlete Feyissa Lelissa stated that he can't return back to his country for fear of reprisal attack by the government after he made a gesture of protest after the race. His mom, Beritu Fulasa supports his decision. She said ""he shouldn't believe what the government says. I don't trust them. He should stay where he is now. I would be happy to see him return, but I can do nothing. Yesterday, I cried so much. Now, I am okay. I want him to stay there. I wish him all the best."" Human rights groups report the death of 400 protesters in the hands of security forces in an ongoing protest over the master plan that incorporates some part of Oromia into Addis Ababa. Despite the halting of implementation of the plan, the protest grew into human rights and call for the release of prisoners. Iftu Mulisa, wife of Athlete Feyissa Lelissa, said that the entire family is in a state of uneasiness. She said that the gesture of her husband, Athlete Feyissa Lelissa, to express his solidarity with the people of Oromo didn't surprise her. She recalls that her husband, Athlete Feyissa Lelissa, used to feel sorrow when he sees the beating, imprisonment and killing of people. ""At first, I was afraid but not surprised. I know the reason. He used to feel anger internally when he sees the beating, imprisonment and killing on social media. His decision didn't come as a surprise to me because his inside was filled with rage."" The government challenges the number of protesters killed. The government claims that the protesters are unlawful and sponsored by opposition groups based in abroad. Soko Feyissa, the daughter of Athlete Feyissa Lelissa, is seen wearing the gold medal awarded to her father at the Tokyo marathon. She said that she missed her dad and doesn't know his whereabouts.

"The third Patriarch, His Holiness Antonios, who is under house arrest, has had his phone taken away after refusing to sign to admit guilt and remorse. The third Patriarch, His Holiness Antonios, is under house arrest after being forced to step down from his position at the Orthodox Church by the Issaias regime and his cronies from the Sinod after 10 years, having done no wrong. Sources have informed us that he refused to sign an admission of guilt and remorse offered him by higher security officials of the regime on August 30, 2016 and has had his phone taken away. The regime's agents, in a continuation of their so-called reconciliation efforts, held meetings with him repeatedly, and in the course of an appointment yesterday, Tuesday August 30, the agents pleaded with the Third Patriarch, His Holiness Antonios, to admit his guilt and to remove his ban on the members of the Sinod, but he reaffirmed his rejection of the agents, saying, ""I will not sign today and I will not sign tomorrow; I have spoken."" And as a punishment, the agents took away his phone and left him under house arrest. The sources added that they are concerned for the health of the Third Patriarch, His Holiness Antonios, reminding that he is advanced in age and has chronic diseases, and that they are worried that the pressure from the regime's agents will further deteriorate his health. They have also called on religious leaders and followers to pray for him. In the past few weeks different groups, including national church branches in North America, Europe and the Middle East, made joint announcements denouncing a prior announcement made by the dictatorial regime of Issaias in collusion with his agents that claimed that the Patriarch, His Holiness Antonios, said: ""...I admit to all my mistakes whether intentional or not, and my sincere apologies to the Holy Church and to the Holy Sinod."" They explained that the regime and the self-appointed Patriarch are the ones who should apologize, and not Patriarch Antonios, who is a victim. And they also suggested that, if the process is for reconciliation and is to be accepted by the public, an independent third party should participate as an observer, witness and mediator",0

"African leaders say that development is decisive in stemming the flow of African refugees. African leaders at the African Union Congress outside of Johannesburg said that development is decisive in order to stop the blood-drenched flow of hopeless African emigrants. Recently, over 100 thousand African emigrants have made the dangerous journey to cross the Mediterranean for a new life in Europe. The International Organization for Migration said that approximately 102 thousand people have attempted to undergo this dangerous journey. Most of the emigrants were from Sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately, all of them don't make it. In this year alone, 1800 people have drowned in the Mediterranean. The leaders meeting in South Africa say that the problem starts at home. The emigrants leave because of the conflicts in their home countries, unemployment and bad treatment. The President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, said that leaders should take responsibility. President Jacob Zuma said: ""We have witnessed, with suffering and shame, the death of our African brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers and children trying to escape conflicts, poverty, oppression and unemployment and cross to Europe for a better life."" He added that: ""Because we should all take responsibility, we should redouble our efforts to improve the lives of the people."" African Union Chairwoman Mrs. Nikizazana Dlamini-Zuma said that there is hope if African countries will commit to development. She said:""If we educate and train people, focusing on science, engineering, technology, mathematics and inventions, people will stop making the dangerous journey across the Sahara and the Mediterranean.

Then, we left for the affected regions, with the donation from our companies, Abida and Miras, as well as the microphones, provided by websites including Misranim, Anatuprak, Karwan, and Qimbulak. Certainly, this place is more than 50 kilometers away from Kiriye. We successfully delivered the food and clothes to the victims. The magnitude of 7.3 in the report is really high; however, thankfully, Allah has blessed our town and given this miracle. We knew from the Aqqang Township government that no one was injured, and only some houses were toppled. Of course, this is due to the fact that the earthquake occurred in a sparsely populated rural region. A rockslide damaged 150,000Mu of grassland, which caused 319 livestock to be killed. The pictures you saw on Wechat in recent days are from the most seriously damaged place. In total, there are only 10 pictures. We know that the reports from news agencies from the Central government and the Autonomous Region are from those pictures. However, some people on the Internet have posted pictures from the previous year's earthquake, giving wrong information. What you have seen here is the real condition of Uyghur people in this rural area. They are too poor to assemble donations. People who came here to assist these victims also updated with live reports. Now I want to say, please collect donations based on their need. We really need the necessary supplies. The victims are living in emergency tents, and because the affected region is in the mountains, they need coal for warming. Because so much land has been damaged, they need fodder for their herds too. Please remember to visit the poor Uyghur people in rural areas regardless of any excuse. I wish someone could collect money to cover the volunteers' travelling expenses. In this way, we could spend money on other poor Uyghur people in other rural areas, because this is a sparsely populated region, whose area is very large. Even if you reach here, you would not know where to find them. We are touched by people's motivations, reflecting a united spirit that says that, if one side is in trouble, the other sides will come to help. So, I advise those hesitating to come, think carefully. Accordingly, the current supplies and donations from our enterprisers and the government have exceeded expectations. ...... May Allah keep you all healthy ...... Ababakri Muhtar, reported from Misranim: an affected region, not a disaster region. May peace be up on you, my friends. I'm representing Misranim, Anatuprak, Qimbulak and Karwan websites to give a live report regarding to the condition of the affected regions. As I said at the beginning, words like ""disaster region"" in articles undoubtedly shocked everyone. A disaster region is an unfortunate place we don't want to visit. The correct term should be ""an affected region."" Please pay attention to your word usage. This morning, after a conversation with the leader of Keriye County, I found out that, since yesterday evening, many friends have delivered fodder and coal for the victims. Even the supplies from the government have exceeded the people's needs. I suggest other friends not come here, as other media have reported, because this situation is not as bad as it sounds. But still, with Allah's mercy, I am sad, having seen our friends' poverty. The people, who are already poor, attract our attention after this earthquake. God know how many poor families like them are existing in Xinjiang. After all, distributing the donated supplies has become a problem. Many charities are raising donations now, but the families live far away from each other. Under the circumstances, it is almost impossible to deliver the supplies to them. How we should do this",0

"Perhat Tursun Perhat Tursun, I am telling you that I would rather lose than be a man without honor; I am not praising you, Perhat Tursun. I'd rather curse you and your tasteless poems than praise you. I laughed at the cute pauper in your story and stopped immediately; you embarrassed me publicly. You poured the Tarim River Gandon on my head and why do you challenge the way we, the Uyghur people, praise people? If you do this, who will stay by your side? You treated me as a dervish, so I fear thinking of you as I fear water. I am hospitalized from overplaying Paradox. Perhat Tursun, you are my heart disease. If it is a dim poem, I will understand; but it is a cloudy one. How can he live with himself? I like it. Is there anyone who plays Paradox? Let those of us who are not afraid of being psychopaths play Paradox. I will keep it up. What do we call this, a poem? Uploaded time: 2016-1-5 21:23 by muhlis0998 Is there anyone who plays Paradox? Suffering from mental illness. First start and we will see if it continues. Perhat Tursun, you are my heart disease. The last lines of the poem are good and I hope Yarghul's writings will be a success. To readers of Yarghul: Focus on the points that you feel are useless in masterpieces, where the absolute world is, at which you are arriving soon. That is, distinguish the word from talk: plunge into the depth of words, discover their meaning endlessly. Surely you will be convinced by the truths of a tireless poet about the desertion of meaning. I wonder how he speaks endlessly about sex, darkness and death. Unknown author. Perhaps it's you that she is cursing. Turn away from those to whom you are accustomed and those whom you love. Turn your eyeballs into poisonous arrows and focus on the shameless praises ... Just realize you can learn nothing from us. Plunge into our color, flow into our sounds, bloom from our stings, but forget us utterly for the sake of our values. Yes, it terrified and frightened me. I found myself very lonely, like my aunt, who lived alone in our village. I know poets die early without seeing or enjoying life, but it encourages me to read lines about a bright future. I will be satisfied with lies and betrayals. Come at me stealthily and secretly. Please lift my curved son; pull my light-weight body; burn my last fairy tale... I wonder what would happen if not for my organs standing up in the dark night and my feelings of concern lasting me till January. My hard burden oppresses me, and if there were not someone invisible behind me, life would be a misery... I feel like a surplus gland, yet passionate like the winter birds... I love the world with a somewhat crooked passion... and I believe writing poems in this age is corruptive to hearts... I am afraid of something...suspicious of something... perhaps my suspicion is because of the silence of the sky. I am waiting for something, seeking comfort from something. Perhaps I have been waiting for death or the life after it..",0

"Number of deaths in the Mediterranean Sea reaches record high In 2016, the number of deaths of refugees who tried to cross to Europe through the Mediterranean Sea exceeded a record high of 5,000. Compared to this, the number of refugees reaching the coasts of Europe, especially after the closure of the route from Turkey to Greece and other eastern routes, has decreased by two-thirds. The reason the death toll has reached 5,000 is because two boats capsized in the sea coasts of Italy, near Sicily. The Italian Coast Guard was unable to rescue 100 people out of 257 refugees. A spokesman of the UNHCR office, when talking about this incident, explained that on average 14 people were dying daily in 2016, hoping to find a better life in Europe. According to the report by the U.N. branch that deals with refugees, the type of boats being used by the traffickers were getting worse and their systems were getting more sophisticated to escape being tracked. In 2016, the traffickers used to send plenty of boats at the same time in order not to be arrested; this created problems for the rescue efforts and hence the number of deaths increased. The high increase in the death toll in the Mediterranean Sea has happened in the same year that the number of refugees reaching Europe has decreased. According to the reports by UNHCR, while one million refugees reached Europe in 2015, the number decreased to less than 360,000 in 2016. When compared with the number of refugees reaching Europe, the number of deaths in Mediterranean Sea has increased by one-third in 2016. In 2015, the death toll of refugees was 3,770; in 2014, this number was at 3,280. When compared with the high number of refugees and the fewer deaths prior to 2016, the probability of death while at sea increased three-fold in 2016. The real number of deaths is believed to be higher than what is reported. UNHCR reports that the deaths of hundreds of people trying to cross from Morocco to Spain are mostly not reported. Besides the unaccounted deaths at sea, in 2016 alone 1,100 refugees have reportedly died in the Sahara desert",0

"Records indicate that Mother Nature has meted out punishment to humankind on a total of three occasions during the last one-hundred years. Two of these instances were in China. One instance was the great flood of 1931, in which in excess of 3.5 million people died in China. The second instance was the 1976 Tangshan Earthquake, where over 250 thousand died. More than 120 thousand people died in this current tsunami. Although there is a diminishing trend to the number of casualties in these three disasters, the figure of 120 thousand is nonetheless alarming indeed. Where the beaches of these countries were littered with human bodies, surprisingly there were no wild animal corpses to be found. Some animals, including elephants, during the preceding few days had already taken to their heels and headed for the mountains. And only after the tsunami was over did they come down to search for water. Is this an accident? Run Taoyan tells us it isn't!

">On the evening of February 13th, I reached out to the netizens of the One Som Project about extending their helping hands to the people affected by the earthquake. It took as little as 4 days for The One Som Project netizens and brothers in Bortala to raise a donation worth 70,000 Som, 96 bags of clothing items equivalent to 4000 articles of clothing as well as 200 pieces of new clothing. In order to bring this whole commitment to the people in the most remote and neglected areas possible, 3 of the donors set out on a journey to Hotan on the 17th and started paying visits on the 19th. Another donor took with him 26 bags of clothing items to Urumqi to send out to Hotan, and returned the next day. The following is a diary of the donors who visited Keriye: 1. We arrived in Atchan Village of Keriye Prefecture. After learning that help did not reach the Kunes and Shung'gul villages because of bad road conditions, we decided to go there instead, as we were hoping to cover the places that needed the most help. The road did indeed turn out to be in terrible and dangerous condition. We barely finished the journey of 60 kilometers in 4 long hours. As a positive sign ,though, the young folks who had traveled quite a journey to greet us had a cross-country vehicle prepared. One would not be able to hold back tears seeing those grandpa-and-grandma-like old folks thanking you with tears in their eyes. After delivering the 10'000 Som in cash, 5000 Som worth of goods (based on the information provided by those who had travelled to those places and learned about the unavailability of material goods, which we had brought with us) and 150 pieces of new clothing items, we returned to the town center by 10:00 pm. 2",0

Flu would lie dormant for almost 3-4 days and show symptoms such as: getting hot, coughing, lack of phlegm, headache, and muscle aches later. It is necessary to avoid contact with live birds throughout one's daily life. If contact with them becomes necessary, make sure to wash hands with soap immediately.

"I could not publish general reports on Keriye in time because internet access was so poor. Apologies. We arrived at Keriye and continued our trip to the affected area. Recently, our brothers and sisters had used WeChat as their battle field. Since yesterday, they had plenty of time to curse the Turkish singer and his fans. They had time to slander and curse Misranim and other Uyghur websites, and even Xinjiang TV. However, we all made our way to the earthquake-affected area and left for the scene. We were very critical of Uyghur enterpereneurs, but once they were mobilized, we stopped blaming them. We also blamed some other people who did not immediately respond but who informed us that they would arrive to the location by tomorrow. And then we still denounced the companies, even though they provided support to the best of their abilities. Then we started criticizing people who went to the scene. We hoped our brothers and sisters would quickly recover from sickness born of extreme excitement. If Allah will allow us, we will try to report the situation in detail from the scene. I beg our brothers and sisters, the Uyghur ündidar friendship circle, to be covered in flowers of love and unity! Please avoid accusations and complaints. Thanks! We visited some of the residents in the Old Town of Keriye County, where the houses had cracks in the walls. Companies such as Abide and Miras sent humanitarian aid, including food and clothing to the affected people at the scene; in the meantime, they also passed along warm greetings to all our brothers and sisters. On websites, local people were interviewed on the spot. If Allah allows, we will publish the details on our websites as soon as possible. At present, our brothers' moods and mental states are strong. The second station is Achchan Township. Other news on Keriye from Uyghur web visitors: Hello! Dear brothers, today we left from Urumqi in the morning and arrived in Hotan at 9:00 in the evening. We took rescue goods with us that were provided by companies such as Abide and Miras. ,In the meantime, reporters from Misranim, Ana Tupraq, Karwan, Chimbulaq and other Uyghur websites took their microphones with them and went to the affected area. It is a 50-km distance from here. We handed over food and clothes to the affected people together with the companies' representatives. The power level of the earthquake is a 7.3-magnitude, an extremely high number. However, Allah protects our homeland: it was as if a miracle happened. According to the information from the Atchan township government, no casualties were reported, but the walls of houses were cracked. The cause was the epicenter being sparsely populated. In addition, 150,000 mu of pasture was destroyed by the huge mountain slide. 319 farm animals died. Everyone saw pictures of the earthquake on WeChat. Well, those pictures that you saw were taken from the most affected area. In total, there are no more than 10 pictures and all pictures were taken from CCTV and Xinjiang TV: there are no new pictures. However, some web writers published old pictures that were taken of the earthquake that occurred several years ago aspart of an attempt to convince the public that the pictures were taken of this quake. This resulted in a bad feeling among the people. One could only feel the real situation of our people on the actual spot. It was our peoples' poverty in Hotan that led to the considerable donation activities among us. People did not stop making donations until now. Visitors who came to the affected area also spread the news and tried to respond to peoples' feeling. At the moment, I would like to suggest that if someone were to make a donation, or organize a support team, the most needed and necessary things are coal and animal fodder. Because the affected area is close to the mountain, night temperatures can reach levels so low that local people need coal in order to stay warm. In addition, a great number of winter pastures were destroyed; therefore, the livestock and house animals need fodder. If people want to help, their best choice is to send only their representatives. It is difficult to contact the affected people or local officials here, because the affected area is so wide and the population settled so sparsely. If you come here, I want to inform you that it is really difficult to contact the affected people or local officials. In that case, you would not be able to hand over your donations. We are very impressed by our brothers' help and kind responses. Through these deeds, they show their generosity when others need urgent help. But we further suggest that you consider more calmly before you decide to come here. At present, there is already enough food and other daily necessities, even more than they need..... May Allah be grateful to you!..... Ababekri Muhtar's report from the Misranim website: The term ""disaster area"" is the wrong expression, I think. The correct phrase should be ""affected area."" Dear brothers, I am a representative of websites such as Misranim, Ana Tupraq, Chimbulaq and Karwan, which reported the situation at the affected area. The term ""disaster area,"" used in a lot of reports and essays, really surprised us. The literary meaning of the term ""disaster area"" is ""dangerous place where people can not stay"". Therefore, the correct expression of this term should be ""the affected area."" I hope we use the correct term and words when writing essays. This morning, I talked with the head of Keriye County and found out that our brothers donated a great amount of coal and animal fodder. Currently, the rescue goods and other necessities at the County storage facilities have already exceeded the needs. Furthermore, I do not recommend that many people come here, as has been mentioned in other media because the situation is not as serious as we had imagined from afar. May Allah be merciful to our brothers! It is a pity to see our people's poverty and these miserable conditions. This time, the earthquake let the public know just how poor the local people were. How many poor villages existed in Xinjiang like that? Only Allah knows! Well, then, we return to our topic: it is a difficult problem to hand over rescue goods and other donations to the affected people. Charity organizations and the people did a lot of good things, but emergency goods must reach the hands of the affected people. Due to the fact that local residents settled down sparsely, how should we get the donations into their hands? What can we do",0

"Aids - the agony of Xinjiang Adip edited the post at the end. 13:21 18 -10-2015 Our brothers might remember I wrote an article titled ""The most beautiful Chinese woman in Xinjiang"" a couple days ago. In my article I personally expressed my gratitude to Mrs. Song Qingling, who earned people's respect by greatly contributing to the development of soccer in Xinjiang. 2. At the end of my article, I changed the subject from soccer, which is the hope of Xinjiang to Aids, which is the agony of Xinjiang and said that we were expecting the most beautiful Chinese lady in Xinjiang's Aids treatment and prevention campaign to please us. I mentioned that. 3. Actually, what I was implying was that the current first lady, Peng Liyuan, could do something for our Aids problems in Xinjiang. Nothing wrong with hoping for this. We Uyghur people have a proverb saying a mother does not breastfeed the baby if the baby does not cry. 4. The respected mother of the nation, Madam Peng Liyuan is a respected figure in the Aids campaign in China as well as all over the world. The coming of the first lady might make a new way for the research campaigns in Aids prevention that previously have not progressed. Also, it would be exciting if the first lady gives a speech to a of couple colleges in Xinjiang and would show support for young people of every nationality in Xinjiang. 5. http://bbs.izdinix.com/thread-65040-1-1.html This was the post with the title ""The most beautiful Chinese woman in Xinjiang."" Right, Aids is the common voice of the whole society. I hope our online friends observe things in a practical way and not an emotional way. If the registered beauty shops for foot washing were closed, one way of transmitting Aids would be blocked. It might be a big thing if Madam Peng Liyuan gives a speech. Ways for transmitting Aids are wide open. The best propaganda in our society is ""you will not be infected if you apply the condom correctly."" Actually, if the propaganda said ""do not do things that will get you infected with Aids,"" it would be more efficient. How about we publish an open letter signed by netizens to invite Madam Peng Liyuan to be an ""image ambassador"" in the Aids prevention campaign in Xinjiang? If all of the brothels with names like the washing foot city or the cold drink house were closed and people had a view of life that honored purity this disaster would be controlled. If the government politically intervenes in Aids prevention, makes Aids a very sensitive issue that people can not talk about or even think about, and deals with Aids infected people the way the government deals with the national security issues and the social issues, I think they could completely destroy Aids in the area, otherwise it is hard. Caring about them and not misunderstanding their Aids infection... and blah blah. This doesn't cross my mind at all. Sometimes, I think they would praise this illness if it was transmitted from something better. I think sometimes. Not all the doctors with white coats are angels and there are some devils in hospitals. So, it is really important to find the right doctors and avoid some unknown and uncertified doctors. That is one of the most important measures for preventing diseases. My little sister got a blood infection disease in her elementary school after being given immunization shots by the school. After the inquiry we learned that some doctors from inland China tested some newly invented shots on the students. Who knows then, right? My beloved sister passed away after suffering from the disease for 20 years. Schools open their doors for those conspirators. They don't worry about anything because they have certificates with big stamps. The probability of getting infected with Aids from medical devices is very high and people get infected quickly. So, don't expect mercy or protection from some ladies or some fathers. Let's just be more careful and cautious. All the dirty brothels under the various names must be closed and the owners shot, that is it. The shutdown is one of the ways but the most important thing is awareness of people about this issue. If people's awareness is raised they will naturally avoid those kinds of dirty places. What is supposed to happen to other getting infected with Aids. Even though our senior people over 50 and 60 try to get more wives and our young people are obsessed with having sex with girls. Let's look at ourselves before trying to dig into other people's faults. If only we get Aids but not others, of course there is a reason here to blame ourselves. The topic is about girls when we get together, from the morning to evening in any occasion like wedding and parties. Were we created only for that? The comment is a live issue. There is nothing but male hormones in our talk. A compulsory investigation should be conducted by the attendance of all people including workers, employees, and farmers for finding infected people. The government should take their blood samples and archive them and provide medical care for them separately. What is supposed to happen other getting infected by Aids even though our senior people over 50-60 try to get more wives and our young people are obsessed about having sex with girls. Let's look at ourselves before trying to dig other people's faults. If only we get Aids but others, of course there is a reason here to blame ourselves. The topic is about girls when we get together, from the morning to evening in any occasion like wedding and parties. We were created only for that? In addition to this comment, my suggestion is following: Since the situation is like this, it is not a bad idea to increase sex education while we strengthen the moral education. Is there any other way to keep some people who can not stop some sexual behavior safe other than teaching how to use condom correctly? Anyway, every person will be responsible for what they do in the future. The point is to prevent the disease from being transmitted to others. If the strengthening of moral education worked, this dirty illness would already be diminished. Windboy posted time 14:07 19-10-2015 ...even though our senior people over 50 and 60 try to get more wives. If they are told that it is safe as long as they use condom, would the number of people who have sex without marriage not increase ? Aids would disappear if the authorities paid attention to it as much as they did stability. The China News Agency, December 1st report: According to the news of the United Nations on November 30, just before the World Aids Day, the United Nations called on all its branches to organize different activities to expand the antiretroviral therapy into all the infected groups and achieve an Aids free next generation. The WHO reported on October 31st, that the control of Aids virus transmission in Millennium Development Goal (MDGs) has already has been achieved in advance of the date. This great achievement is highly relevant because of antiretroviral therapy. The WHO indicated that if Aids infected people use antiretroviral drugs immediately after they become infected, there is a big possibility to keep their condition healthy. Also, using antiretroviral drugs prevents onward transmission of HIV and It also recommends offer of pre-exposure prophylaxis to people at substantial risk of HIV infection as an additional prevention choice as part of comprehensive prevention. At the same time, An infected mother can reduce the risk to transmit HIV to a baby if she use antiretroviral drugs. Huge reductions have been seen in death and infection rates when antiretroviral therapy is in use, particularly during early stages of the disease. Since its pick in 2004 until now, the rate of death from Aids reduced 42%. Also the rate of new HIV infections has been reduced 35% since 2000. Antiretroviral therapy especially has been expended throughout Africa and the number of people who received antiretroviral therapy reached 11 million when it was only 11 thousand in 2000. During their global meeting this year, world leaders made a new sustainable development goal. This included the goal to eliminate Aids infection permanently before 2030. To achieve this goal, the number of newly-infected people by HIV should be reduced by 75% of the current totals, and the current number of the HIV-infected people who received antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be doubled in number by 2020, the WHO emphasized.

"Victims of the smuggler who is being hunted say that the one apprehended is not him. June 10, 2016: Washington, D.C.: Italian and British authorities are facing huge pressure after reportedly catching the dangerous criminal human smuggler. When victims of the dangerous criminal said that an innocent refugee was caught instead of the dangerous criminal, Italian and British police were criticized heavily. The British crime agency, which participated in the operation, said that it is not the time to comment about the suggestions. ""The National Intelligence Agency is confident about its methods of intelligence gathering,"" said the announcement. Many Eritreans are expressing their support for Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe, 27, who was apprehended in the streets of Khartoum and taken to Italy. They explained that Medhanie Tesfariam is an innocent refugee who never had any hand in human smuggling. ""I know Medhanie Yihdego Meried, I recognize him very well. And this is not him."" said Eritrean student Anbes Yemane, 27, who was smuggled to Italy by Medhanie Yihdego Meried. Anbes remembers that they were treated like animals rather than humans in a crowded and dirty place before they set out to sea. ""Their treatment is really bad. Medhanie intimidated me personally. He was threatening us with a gun. But the picture that I saw from the Italian police is not Medhanie Yihdego."" Another individual, who wanted to be anonymous because he believes Medhanie Yihdego is in Khartoum working freely and that his relatives might be in danger if he identifies himself, said, ""This individual caught by the Italians is not the person who smuggled me. I know Medhanie Yihdego really well, I have known him since 2011. So I don't have any problem recognizing him. The arrested individual is not the smuggler."" ""He is a very dangerous and a very powerful person; I have relatives in the Sudan, and if he knows that I am giving this information, he can visit revenge upon them."" According to information from former victims of the smuggler, Medhanie Yihdego Meried, 35, who is allegedly the smuggler, who is the person arrested on Wednesday and taken to Italy, is still living in the Sudan. Who is Medhanie Yihdego Meried? Nicknamed ʼGeneralʼ, Medhanie Yihdego Meried runs a human smuggling business with a worth estimated in the billions of dollars. This 35-year-old Eritrean's name is mentioned in connection with a horrifying accident involving a boat that sank at the end of 2013 near the Italian island of Lampedusa, killing 359 refugees. A Canada-based lawyer, Kathrine Duwhay, who practices law on illegal money transfers, says that Medhanie is suspected of heading the smuggling network in Africa and Europe. In an interview with the BBC, she said, ""He is dangerous because he controls a lot of people and a lot of money."" ""As a kingpin, it is understood that billions have been transferred through him."" The Italian newspaper Corriere Della Serra explains that it has been heard that Medhanie Yihdego has connections with Libyan authorities and has employees in Italy.

"There was indeed an earthquake. The epicenter of the 7.3-magnitude earthquake was in a deserted area that is located more than 100 kilometers away from the downtown of Keriye and dozens of kilometers away from Atchan village. In addition to that, considering the 7.3 magnitude strong quake, because the earthquake occurred during the daytime and the area is sparsely populated, and many were at work instead of being at home, except for those collapsed houses (about 50 to 60 houses collapsed) and the death of few livestock, there was no greao loss. The old town of Keriye County, which is continuously being mentioned in websites, is a special zone of Keriye County that was the earliest residential area where the traditional Uyghur sedentary culture has been preserved, similar to the streets of Old Kashgar. Here houses were adjacent to each other and the area is heavily populated, in addition to the existence of numerous old houses. For this reason, it's easy to say that some houses in this area might have been damaged by the quake. If so, what types of houses are they? Simply say, they are the houses that were damaged during the quake. The most shocking factor is the age of the houses. Some of them might be 50 to 60 years old while some of the newest ones would be 8 years old. There still might be some houses that are about 5 years old. Why there are so many old houses",0

"Athlete Feyisa Lilesa shouldn't trust the government's announcement and return home, warned his family. A few days after athlete Feyisa Lilesa won second place in the marathon at the Olympics and showed hand gestures of the opposition, the government announced that he wouldn't have any problems if he returned to his country, but athlete Feyisa Lilesa's family warned that he shouldn't return trust the government's announcement and return. Athlete Feyisa Lilesa stretched his hands and crossed them upwards and showed the hand gesture of the Oromo people's opposition after finishing second at the finishing line of the marathon at the Olympics in Rio and was awarded the silver medal. The regional state of Oromia has seen opposition against the government's land administration and human rights for months. Athlete Feyisa Lilesa stated that he is afraid measures will be taken against him for showing the gesture. His mother, Biritu Fulasa, also supports his decision. She said, ""Can the government be trusted about what it said? I don't trust it. He should stay where he is. I would be happy if he returned but what can I do? I cried a lot yesterday. But I am okay now. I want him to stay where he is. and I wish him the best,"" she said. Last June, human rights advocates announced that at least 400 people were killed by security forces while taking part in the demonstrations against the plan to cede parts of the Oromia regional state to Addis Ababa.

He was really sad because he was watching the beatings, imprisonments and killings on social media. That is why I wasn't surprised at all, because he was sad,"" said Iftu Melisa. The government says that the number of those killed is not correct. The demonstrations were conducted illegally and orchestrated by opposition groups in the Diaspora, said the government.

"Even if the EPRDF regime covers up the increase of prices it will be uncovered. The increase of prices in our country created because of the corrupt administration of the EPRDF regime has resulted in social problems our entire society and it is getting worse from time to time, because of the high prices, particularly those who have low income cannot find the different things them need, it is clear they are exposed to worse problems. However, the occupational EPRDF regime that says it is administering our country and people, because it could not find supply for our people who live in different places and in a time that they are suffering from the increase in prices and demand they are heard saying the economy of the country is on the fat road of growth and lecturing with dead words. Particularly at this time the regime is not providing enough support to a considerable number of our citizens who are hit by draught caused by shortage of rain and they are losing their lives, in addition to the increase of prices that is coming to our country from time to time and knowing this the regime says the people lack nothing through the window of television, this proves it is not a group that stands for the people. And this has enabled the people to totally lose faith on the occupational regime and to lose hope. The occupational EPRDF regime that is know by its pretension not by its deeds, the people, be it girls or boys, old and young are forced to stand queues at hotels to buy leftovers. And this clearly shows the failing of the economy of our country Because of that the affected society is repeatedly presenting its problems to the government but not listened and that has made it make its anger worse; and the wealthy are increasing prices and selling as they please, and that has made the poor unable to buy and has expose them to problems. And because the monthly salaries that is paid to government workers has been lowered and the lack means to buy grain, sweetener items like oil, onions and sugar, and to pay rents, they are migrating to other countries. As such, the EPRDF regime is saying our people are eating three times a day and saying that in particular forums for years, but the people, because of the living price hikes and what followed, and being asked to pay taxes beyond their means and lack the means to pay, in frustration is asking to hand over their lands but they could not find anyone to listen to them. In the last weeks in a market survey they conducted in a grain store, the leaders of EPRDF in Addis Ababa they were heard saying there was no price hikes; but the people are angered by the lopsided answer. Food items that are needed to build the life of human beings, such as meat, butter. Eggs and the like that have been missing from their tables for many years, wealthy people who opened restaurants that are found in many localities of Addis Ababa rare not benefitting, the problem is worsening from time to time, after investing their heavenly wealth to serve the people, now they are seen closing the restaurants",0

"Women rights would not be guaranteed by the EPRDF. It's a known fact that women are half of society. Because of the policies of the past autocratic rulers in our country, women were not able to equally participate in the social, economic and political life of society. There was no chance for women to come out and express their voices and to express their democratic rights. Therefore, like any oppressed Ethiopian citizen, to liberate themselves from the misery, hardship and oppression, and to secure their democratic rights, social justice, equality, peace and economic development, Ethiopian women, and especially the women of Tigray, played a major role in the 17 years of remarkable struggle and paid heavily in terms of life and disability. Women of our country have contributed everything required by the struggle for their own rights and the rights of the oppressed population. During the struggle, they faced natural and human-made obstacles, but confronted these obstacles by arming themselves on an equal footing with their brothers; participating equally fearlessly in battles, facing bullets and land mines, and acted like lionesses. Ethiopian women, and especially Tigray women, have paid a heavy toll in terms of life and disability; they performed historic and heroic acts; and became lionesses, achieving their objectives in total victory. The fruit of their struggle and sacrifices, however, have been hijacked by the treacherous TPF/EPRDF regime, and the victory that was paid for in blood is wasted. Today, women are facing countless problems and live abject conditions. As the entire dispossessed population of Ethiopia did not see the fruits of its spectacular 17-year struggle, women, as half of society, have not been able to realize any gains, either. Therefore, since the governance that women and the whole country are subjected to is so abusive and atrocious, women, like all members of society, are devoid of their rights. They are experiencing double abuse by the TPLF/EPRDF regime. They are burdened by these problems and are in dire conditions of merciless poverty, migration, famine, diseases, ignorance, abuse, imprisonment, suffering and death. The abuse of human rights and unemployment prevailing in our country have created disorder in the social livelihoods of women. Those sisters of ours who cannot withstand all these problems have emigrated to take refuge elsewhere and are facing abuse and humiliation along the way. Even for their future lives to live freely fighting for their privileges, they have been deprived to struggle for their rights, to organize and to educate themselves. They keep them in darkness. In name only, the regime talks tactically of associations, leagues, women's federation, Meles leadership training academy, etc. Presenting women as part and parcel of the evil regime, it does everything to keep them under its full control, obedient to its policies, by depriving them of their human rights. Therefore, the struggle that was aimed at justice, peace, democratic rights, equality and respect has been hijacked. It is serving the needs of the minority. Today, because of cheap and cliquish administration, the country and its people are moving toward dangerous downfall and confusion with the unity of the country in perils. This has led to the lives of innocent citizens to vanish in streets. Many citizens are being hunted and taken to prisons by security forces for crimes they didn't commit. This increases the agony and suffering of our mothers and sisters. This is because women are the social life of society. Therefore, the ruling EPRDF regime, which, for the last 25 years, committed atrocities by trampling the rights of citizens, and especially those of women, it will not guarantee human and democratic rights now. Therefore, without difference of gender, we must get rid of the selfish regime by joining the process of armed struggle for democratic change",0

"Victims of the wanted human trafficker say that the arrested one is not him 10 June 2016, Washington, DC. Italian and English authorities said that when they arrested a human trafficker they were under pressure. When victims of the human trafficker said that the arrested was not him but rather an innocent refugee, Italian and English police were criticized. The person who participated in the mission said that the time has not come for England's National Crime Agency to answer the questions pertaining to this incident. ""The National Crime Agency is confident of the way it gathers information,"" was the response. Many Eritreans are expressing their support for the 27-year-old Medhanie Tesfamariam who was taken from the streets of Khartoum and extradited to Italy. They said that Medhanie Tesfamariam is an innocent refugee who didn't participate in human trafficking. ""I know Medhanie Yehdego Mered, I know him very well. This is not him,'' says Eritrean student Ambes Yemane, who was trafficked by Medhanie Yehdego Mered to Italy in December 2013. Ambes recalls that before going into the sea they were contained in a very small and messy place and that they were treated like cattle rather than humans. ""The way they treat you is very bad. Medhanie himself had threatened me. He used to threaten us with a gun. But the photo I have seen from the Italian police is not Medhanie."" Another client of Medhanie Yehdego, who didn't want his name to be mentioned since he believes Medhanie Yehdego is still working freely in Khartoum and could put his relatives there in danger, said, ""The man arrested by Italian police is not the one who trafficked me. I know Medhanie Yehdego very well. I have known him since 2011. Therefore, I can identify him easily. The one arrested is not the human trafficker,'' he said. ""He is very dangerous and has power; I have relatives in Sudan, and if he knows I am saying this he could take revenge on them.'' According to the information gathered from victims of the trafficker, the man called Medhanie Yehdego Mered, 35, who is a human trafficker in Sudan and is said to have been arrested on Wednesday and taken to Italy, is still living in Sudan as he was previously. Who is Medhanie Yehdego Mered? Nicknamed ""The General,"" Medhanie Yehdego Mered is carrying out a multi-billion-dollar human-trafficking business. This 35-year-old Eritrean became known to the world after a boat capsized, killing all 359 refugees just by Lampedusa Island, near Italy, in late 2013. Canadian Kathrin Duhay, an attorney with regard to illegal human trafficking money, said that Medhanie could be the leader of a network of human traffickers in Africa and Europe. She explained in an interview with BBC that, ""He has become strong because he has a lot of money and controls a lot of people."" ""As a coordinator, the money he mobilizes is understood to be in the billions."" An Italian journalist called Couriere Della Siera explains that Medhanie Yehdego has been heard boasting that he has connections with Libyan leaders in Tripoli and that he has some workers in Italy as well. Medhanie had been living in Italy, and when he tried to open a bank account in Dubai, he attracted the focus of criminal investigation agencies. Later he moved to Libya, where many African refugees were passing through to take the risky journey to cross to Europe; and then to Sudan, where he was arrested and imprisoned. Kathrin Duhay: ""If we can talk about human trafficking from Libya and other parts of Africa by the Mediterranean Sea, he must have connections with Daesh as well.""
