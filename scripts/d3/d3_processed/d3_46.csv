Our problem is; my husband is currently working here in a government sector and on ""Definite Contract"" for 2 years with a bachelor status in the company;in short; he is not entitled to get family visa for me unless the contract will not yet renewed and change to family.Because of his eagerness to get a family visa for me; i came here for a family visit and applied for family visa in the immigration andwe are very happy that it was already approved and I had my medical and finger printing..When we went to immigration to apply for an RP the lady told us to go the captain to have my form signed if we are going to shoulder the payment for the visa;unfortunately the captain didn't sign my application form but rather asked for a letter from the company..We are very worried because we understand that the company will not give us a letter to the immigration because my husband is not yet entitled of the family status.. Please give us some advise on what we are going to do; the lady on the counter told me that it is possible to get an RP without the letter but it is the decession of the captain...",1

here is my situation. On August 29 ; I saw an ad on Qatar living for a apartment to be rented in Al Sadd for 8000 QAR. The ad specifically said no comission. I went to see the apartment ; the current tenant just moved in first of August ; and needs to vacate the premises closer to his job ; and needs to find a replacement tenant to take over the lease. I agreed. Then one day before signing the contract with the LANDLORD ; I receive a call from the current tenant informing me that he paid commission to the person who assisted him in finding the apartment ; and that I need to pay him part of the comssion since he only lived there for a month. I thought bout it ; if i disagree ; he will find another renter. So I said ok . Then I signed the contract with the landlord ; and there is no mention of commission on the contract . Now I am living in the new apartment. Do I have to pay the previous tenant the comission ; since I already agreed ; depsite the ad in qatar living saying no comission and also the contract i signed doesnt mention any comission ; the previous tenant said he is not liable for the comission as he only lived there for a few weeks. Please help.,1

My husband has possibly got a job in Qatar and so we are in the process of deciding if we move there or not; just wondered if anyone else has moved there with young children. We have a 5month old baby and a 2 year old. All the info I see is about schooling but wondered if anyone else moved there with children so young. How easy things like medicine and formula etc are to get. Thanks.,1
Which would you prefer to stay at and why?,1
I am in need of recent information on schooling for my 9 year old and 16 year old. I plan to move over in August so will require (places permitting) information on which schools are recommended. My 16 year old would be studying her A levels and my 9 year old would be starting in year 5. I would prefer them to be in the same school; however understand that this may mot be possible. I have already had a message from Doha College to say my 9 year old is on a list and IF shortlisted will then have to sit a test and if passed would be offered a place. I am concerned that if a place does not come up soon or if he doesnt pass the test I would be stuck without a place and would then have to find a different school. Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated.,1

Hi everyone! My girlfriend is working in Doha; so she got a residence permit and she's under a working visa. What happened is that she found out some sort of vascular disease which is ruining her legs (and she works at a restaurant). She needs to make an operation as soon as possible!! But she has been working there for 3 or 4 months now and the company says that they cannot do anything for her because she MUST complete at least 7 months working. This operation is expensive in Qatar and if the company doesn't help to pay she cannot do it. So the solution is to quit the job and come back to Turkey. BUUUT for my surprise she said it is impossible because they wouldn't give her the EXIT PERMIT... It sounds extremely absurd and nonsense since it's a health issue and it seems that she is locked in the country and in a job she can no longer do it. Sorry for the long text but I hope you guys can gimme some advices!,1

We had this appeal - Backpacks for the Children of Japan here in Doha recently. The original target was for about 100 backpacks. The response was overwhelming and the number of backpacks collected by the dateline was almost 1700 backpacks and with 250-300 boxes.

I've heard of giving back the ring; but a man threatens to repossess ex's implants. Would you do the same - or take back gifts you may have given after a breakup ? A German man is demanding his ex-girlfriend pays him back the money he spent on buying her breast implants. The man; named by his first name Carsten in Bild newspaper; paid for his then girlfriend's breast augmentation procedure in 2009. His ex; Anastasia; says she now fears her breasts will be repossessed unless she refunds him the &#163;3;700 cost of the operation. Anastasia admitted that she signed a written agreement with Carsten saying that she would stay with him for at least a year if he paid for the implants. But they broke up soon after Anastasia had the breast augmentation and Carsten now wants his money back. Anastasia; 20; told reporters she had already transferred the equivalent of &#163;2;500 into his bank account. She was worried that Carsten would call the police and get repossesors involved if she failed to pay up. Ananova,0
Occasionally airline flight attendants make an effort to make the in-flight safety lecture a bit more entertaining.

There may be 50 ways to leave your lover; but there are only 6 ways out of this airplane Your seat cushions can be used for floatation; and in the event of an emergency water landing; please take them with our compliments. We do feature a smoking section on this flight if you must smoke; contact a member of the flight crew and we will escort you to the wing of the airplane. Smoking in the lavatories is prohibited. Any person caught smoking in the lavatories will be asked to leave the plane immediately. Pilot -Folks; we have reached our cruising altitude now; so I am going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about as youwish; but please stay inside the plane till we land .it's a bit cold outside; and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight pattern.

I wanted to teach my daughter; who is 4 years old; how important it is to follow the Queue in public places. I wanted to drop the baggage in Lulu hypermarket (Gharaffa) and thought this is the perfect time. I asked my daughter to stand behind the last person and follow the Queue. Poor girl has to stand there for 10 minutes because people will just ignore the Queue and go around her. All sorts of nationalities were doing it (Indians; Nepalese; Arabs; Philippine and Westerners). Finally I went on guard the Queue and directed people to stand behind the girl. Some complied and most of them ignored. My girl came out totally confused and it was so sad. She was not convinced that it is a good idea to stand on Queue. Now please don&#8217;t start bashing on any particular race or nationalities. All were doing it and no excuse at all for that.,0
CHENNAI: A mid-air collision between two flights over Tiruchi was averted at the last minute on Saturday when a Chennai-Madurai Air India flight and a Thiruvananthapuram-Chennai Jet Airways flight came too close. There were 173 passengers on board the two flights. Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) alarm went off in the cockpits of both the aircraft at 1.15pm while they were flying at 16;000 feet over Tiruchi. TCAS issued a &#8216;resolution advisory&#8217; which means the flights were one minute away from colliding with one another. Air India IC 671 flight had 118 passengers and Jet Airways 9W 2758 flight had 55 passengers on board. Sources said the AI flight was descending to land at Madurai airport while Jet Airways aircraft was on a course of ascent after taking off from Thiruvananthapuram airport. &#8216;&#8216;Both the aircraft were given different routes; but somehow the flights came close when the AI flight was told to descend for landing at Madurai airport. The AI aircraft was supposed to descend on a different track. We are yet to pinpoint the error;&#8217;&#8217; said a source. Soon after the warning was sounded in the cockpits; the pilots corrected the course and averted a major accident. The air traffic was being controlled by Thiruvananthapuram air traffic control.,0

I am having an account in CBQ which I am going to close very soon. Recently I had an issue where the bank for no reason deducted Qr. 6000 from my account saying credit card settlement whereas I had settled myt credit card on the same day morning. Since then I have been chasing the bank to credit it back and since my credit cards are already cancelled I have no ways to withdraw the excess. The bank always promised the issue will be solved in a couple of hours and now its been 6 days now. If there is any delay from our side the bank makes sure that they charge us with charges and interest.And when delays happen from their side what do we get us compenstion. Its ridicolous and unacceptable but in the end we are helpless. The only alternative for this is to behave to them like the way you would if you were in a market and be rude to them as maximum as possible. From my experience what I understood is that they dont understand professional way of doing things;,0

I worked 9 months with a private co as a manager. I was asked to resign with a promise to give NOC with one month notice (as per contract 2 month notice if employee resigns). HR sent me email on the first day after submitting resignation confirming to provide NOC. On that assurance; I searched jobs here and when approached for NOC after getting job; they refused to give NOC. After more request asked to show offer letter; then submitted again request letter as they wanted. Still I am being troubled and waiting for NOC. Now; if finally they don't give NOC and cancel my visa; can I lodge complaint with CID or labout dept or with both as I have email proof of confirmation to give me NOC.,0

Happy Thursday.... Yippieeeeeee Thursday has finally arrived. A day to relax and unwind... So whats your plan for the day?,0
Before I came here in Qatar I'd thought that it will be a good start to build up my dreams but when I was here it suddenly changed. I came here in Doha with tourist visa expecting that I can easily find a job. My girlfriend help me to process the papers because she was already 6 months in here. Going here is easy but being here starts my headache. To make the story short my girlfriend got a visa from illegal person and make money on us. In my 1 month tourist visa I found a job that at first I thought it would be a good starting point. I was hired as a sales executive on one of Filipino magazine here in DOHA(quite comfortable at first because I am a Filipino). They have a lot of promises that nothing was been made. They said they will provide transport; gave phone allowance and most of all fix my visa that is already expired. In my 3 month in that company no promises was been made; I don't have my transport; no phone allowance; very delayed salary and the worst is they didn't fixed my visa T_T which started me to worry because of the penalty I'm going to pay. I keep on reminding them and begging to fix my visa which quite helpful because they told me that I will undergo medical and fingerprint. So I've done medical and fingerprint; but on the 4th month on my job another problem happened. The sponsor just told me that I was fired because one of my workmate which get his passport in the office w/o asking permission to our sponsor and never come back to work. Our sponsor got mad and I'm the one he blame for what my workmate did. So everything going to be harsh in Qatar. I've work on that company for 6 months and in my last 2 months of being there I didn't got my salary. They released me from that company because the sponsor and the management got problem on finance. First I thought that it will be a good opportunity to look for another job but it makes me wrong. Mostly the company is looking for transferable visa. I pay my flat rent my food and no work until now. My visa is 6 months and I need more month to be transferable.... My agony continues day by day thinking how to pay my bills and survive in this dessert land.,0

Hi Guys; Good day. I'm under my husband's sponsorship til today but his contract will be ending this April 30. Good thing he's been hired with another company. Sadly; the company will not give release but only NOC so that means we need to go back to our country (cancelled). Plan is;he will come after a week or two after exiting then coming back with a visit visa with the new company. My question is; how fast can my husband gets his New RP and sponsor me and my daughter. Some told us that we need to present again 6 months bank statements. (All our accounts are expected to be closed before exiting). Problem is i have a new offer already but they can't wait that long till i can come back. Your thoughts on this please.,0
"A woman went to a pet shop and immediately spotted a large; beautiful parrot. There was a sign on the cage that said $50.00. ""Why so little?"" she asked the pet store owner. The owner looked at her and said; ""Look; I should tell you first that this bird used to live in a brothel and sometimes it says some pretty vulgar stuff."" The woman thought about this; but decided she had to have the bird anyway. She took it home and hung the bird's cage up in her living room and waited for it to say something. The bird looked around the room; then at her; and said; ""New house; new madam."" The woman was a bit shocked at the implication; but then thought; ""That's really not so bad."" When her two daughters returned from school the bird saw them and said; ""New house; new madam; new girls."" The girls and the woman were a bit offended but then began to laugh about the situation considering how and where the parrot had been raised. Moments later; the woman's husband came home from work. The bird looked at him and said; ""Hi; Keith!"" Funeral services for Keith was performed a couple days later :)",0

"7% Written by a 90 year old This is something we should all read at least once a week!!!!! Make sure you read to the end!!!!!! Written by Regina Brett; 90 years old; of the Plain Dealer; Cleveland ; Ohio . ""To celebrate growing older; I once wrote the 45 lessons life taught me. It is the most requested column I've ever written. My odometer rolled over to 90 in August; so here is the column once more: 1. Life isn't fair; but it's still good. 2. When in doubt; just take the next small step. 3. Life is too short &#8211; enjoy it.. 4. Your job won't take care of you when you are sick. Your friends and family will. 5. Pay off your credit cards every month. 6. You don't have to win every argument. Stay true to yourself. 7. Cry with someone. It's more healing than crying alone. 8. It's OK to get angry with God. He can take it. 9. Save for retirement starting with your first paycheck. 10. When it comes to chocolate; resistance is futile. 11. Make peace with your past so it won't screw up the present. 12. It's OK to let your children see you cry. 13. Don't compare your life to others. You have no idea what their journey is all about. 14. If a relationship has to be a secret; you shouldn't be in it.. 15. Everything can change in the blink of an eye But don't worry; God never blinks. 16. Take a deep breath. It calms the mind. 17. Get rid of anything that isn't useful. Clutter weighs you down in many ways. 18. Whatever doesn't kill you really does make you stronger. 19. It's never too late to be happy. But it&#8217;s all up to you and no one else. 20. When it comes to going after what you love in life; don't take no for an answer. 21. Burn the candles; use the nice sheets; wear the fancy lingerie. Don't save it for a special occasion. Today is special. 22. Over prepare; then go with the flow. 23. Be eccentric now. Don't wait for old age to wear purple. 24. The most important sex organ is the brain. 25. No one is in charge of your happiness but you. 26. Frame every so-called disaster with these words 'In five years; will this matter?' 27. Always choose life. 28. Forgive but don&#8217;t forget. 29. What other people think of you is none of your business. 30. Time heals almost everything. Give time time. 31. However good or bad a situation is; it will change. 32. Don't take yourself so seriously. No one else does.. 33. Believe in miracles. 34. God loves you because of who God is; not because of anything you did or didn't do. 35. Don't audit life. Show up and make the most of it now. 36. Growing old beats the alternative -- dying young. 37. Your children get only one childhood. 38. All that truly matters in the end is that you loved. 39. Get outside every day. Miracles are waiting everywhere. 40. If we all threw our problems in a pile and saw everyone else's; we'd grab ours back. 41. Envy is a waste of time. Accept what you already have not what you need. 42. The best is yet to come... 43. No matter how you feel; get up; dress up and show up. 44. Yield. 45. Life isn't tied with a bow; but it's still a gift."" Its estimated 93% won't forward this. If you are one of the 7% who will; forward this with the title '7%'. I'm in the 7%. Friends are the family that we choose.",0
You pick up a hitch-hiker - a beautiful young girl. Suddenly; she faints inside your car and you take her to a hospital. Now that's stressful. But at the hospital; they say she is pregnant and congratulate you that you are going to be a father. You say you are not the father; but the girl says you are. This is getting VERY stressful. So then; you request for a DNA test to prove that you are not the father. After the tests are completed; the doctor says you are infertile; and probably have been since birth. You are EXTREMELY STRESSED but relieved. On your way home; you think about your 3 KIDS. Now that's STRESS!,0

"The ""k"" dilemma Visited one of my friend. She has a beautiful daughter and she named her ""kshirin""... reminds me of the big time numerology or ""k"" fad going on in India with movie [ Kaho na&#8230;.. to Krish] and TV [ Kyoki Saas&#8230;&#8230;to Kahani Ghar&#8230;&#8230;]soap names starting from ""k"". apparently it is the lucky charm.

Luckily no Kuttappan ruling Qatar or else he would have changed Qatar to &#8220;Kataram&#8221; like Quilon to Kollam. I remember; some grain of rice stuck beneath my key ""k"" in the keyboard which was making me press the key ""k"" extra hard.

"The brits showing their dirty face now that the olympics are over...... Ecuador was due to announce its decision on granting asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Thursday as it slammed Britain for threatening to storm Quito's mission in London to retrieve him. Assange; an Australian national and former computer hacker; came to global attention after his website published a trove of secret documents that hugely embarrassed several governments; most notably the United States; in 2010. Ecuador on Wednesday hit out at Britain for threatening to storm its London mission to arrest Assange; while WikiLeaks said such action would be ""a hostile and extreme act; which is not proportionate to the circumstances."" Those disclosures were the biggest intelligence leak in US history; but in London the focus was on Britain's right to remove Assange from the embassy; should they wish to do so; and the diplomatic furore that could ensue. Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said it would be ""unacceptable"" for British police to enter the embassy. He noted that his country ""has made a decision"" on Assange and would announce it in Quito at 7:00 am (1200 GMT). Patino said Wednesday that Ecuador had received ""an express threat in writing"" from Britain ""that they could storm our embassy if Ecuador does not hand over Julian Assange."" ""Ecuador rejects in the strongest terms the explicit threat made in Britain's official communication;"" Patino told reporters. ""The position taken by the government of Britain is unacceptable; both from the political and the legal point of view;"" he said; warning that entering the embassy without authorisation ""would be a flagrant violation of the Vienna Convention"" on diplomatic relations. Assange took refuge at the embassy on June 19 to avoid extradition to Sweden; which he claims plans to eventually surrender him to US authorities. Assange's mother and the Spanish former judge Baltasar Garzon; who is helping to represent him; recently travelled to Ecuador to argue on his behalf.",0
When a GIRL is quiet ... millions of things are running in her mind.. When a GIRL is not arguing ... she is thinking deeply. When a GIRL looks at u with eyes full of questions ... she is wondering how long you will be around. When a GIRL answers ' I'm fine ' after a few seconds ... she is not at all fine. When a GIRL stares at you she is wondering why you are lying. When a GIRL lays on your chest .. she is wishing for you to be hers forever. When a GIRL wants to see you everyday... she wants to be pampered. When a GIRL says ' I love you ' .. she means it. When a GIRL says ' I miss you ' .... no one in this world can miss you more than that. Life only comes around once make sure u spend it with the right person .... Find a guy .. who calls you beautiful instead of hot. who calls you back when you hang up on him. who will stay awake just to watch you sleep. Wait for the guy who ... kisses your forehead. Who wants to show you off to the world when you are in your sweats. Who holds your hand in front of his friends. Who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares about you and how lucky he is to have you. Who turns to his friends and says; ' That's her!! ',0
Dear Sir; I left Qatar on 24th April 2007. In new sponsorship law 2009 it is mentioned that a person left from qatar on his own can return after 2 years from the date of departure. While leaving from Qatar I did not cancel my visa. I heared that the visa will be cancelled automatically after six months from the date of exit. Kindly clarify if the 2 year ban is from the date of departure or from the date of visa cancellation. Thanks; ala,0

I just needed to let you all know that there is a shocking hair dresser at Medical Spa. She is Tunisian and unfortunately she is also the Manager... so my complaints never reached the owner (the manager just hangs up the phone whenever I call to discuss the matter). I asked her for subtle highlights for my wedding and she did the worst highlights ever. They started over an inch from my scalp; so I looked like I had regrowth before even stepping out of the salon! She gave me bright bleached stripes... not at all the subtle blended highlights that I asked for. Further; she spent the entire time gossiping about the other members of staff; which was not pleasant to hear - totally unprofessional. She is an absolute shocker and I do not recommend any one go there. I used to go there a lot; but having dealt with that impossible woman; I just can't stomach spending any money to assist in making the business successful. I do not recommend going there... Buyer Beware!!,0

okay; I heard this from other sources; but today it was confirmed. I went to the DL office; and my company's govt official talked with several ppl; including manager; and they would not convert. Rules have changed within the last month. A coworker; who is British; got it converted last week; so this is only for Americans... figure that! Sucks heavily because if anything; British and other right-hand-side drivers should be tested! Must be some retribution! So; basically; your options as an American are to go to school and bypass all the schooling and get a test. The test could be a month off! You can plead for something sooner and you may get lucky. But it seems most ppl recommend that you take the minimum 12-day schooling as the tests are totally weird! The school guy was saying only 5% ppl make it through (with grain of salt considering the guy is working for the school). There is a L-test; where you go up a slope; have to stop; then keep going without slipping (on a manual car). Then you have to reverse. Then there is a front-parking. There is no pocket parking or reverse parking. So; its not as bad as it used to be. Well; fellow Americans; it was good until it lasted!,0

Hi everyone Hoping someone can give me some advice and help in my situation. Basically I have been trying to go come to Qatar on a business visa but have been offloaded 3 times by the same officer. 1st time they required some documents from me 2nd time documents were submitted but they required proof from sponsor there. 3rd time they claimed my documents were false where in fact they are more than genuine. I have now been told a that it is going to be very difficult for me to leave the Philippines. I am really upset about this and was wondering if there is anyone who can advise me on this or has a contact that can help me or assist me in this matter; will really appreciate all inputs. All the time the same officers are the ones stopping me; personally I feel a little intimidated.,0
I have been watching tha match between India and Srilanka and was really astonished to see the poor performance of Indian Bowlers. Why do India still keep a Bowler like Yadav who was not performing in the last two matches. His economy is above 7 and India should have someone who can bowl well. Their seamers are all having very bad economy and why dont they try some new bowlers rather than carrying the players like Vinai Kumar and Yadav. I am afraid that India will possibly lose this match also like they lost the last one to Aussies. Sri Lanka has accumulated a very good score of 289 which will be difficult for Indian team to follow.,0

cOPIED fROM A CIRCULATED MAIL I cannot stop myself from sharing this with all of you. Its all started when I received a call from someone claiming that he was from my mobile service provider and he asked me to shutdown my phone for 2 hours for 3G update to take place. As I was rushing for a meeting; I did not question and shutdown my cell phone. After 45 minutes I felt very suspicious since the caller did not even introduce his name. I quickly turned on my cell phone and I received several calls from my family members and the others were from the number that had called me earlier - 3954380. I called my parents and I was shocked that they sounded very worried asking me whether I am safe. My parents told me that they had received a call from someone claiming that they had me with them and asking for money to let me free. The call was so real and my parents even heard 'my voice' crying out loud asking for help. My parent was at the bank waiting for next call to proceed for money transfer. I told my parents that I am safe and asked them to lodge a police report. Right after that I received another call from the guy asking me to shutdown my cell phone for another 1 hour which I refused to do and hu ng up. They keep calling my cell phone until the battery had run down. I myself lodged a police report and I was informed by the officer that there were many such scams reported. MOST of the cases reported that the victim had already transferred the money! And it is impossible to get back the money. Be careful as this kind of scam might happened to any of us!!! Those guys are so professional and very convincing during calls. If you are asked to shut down your cell phone for updates by the service provider; ASK AROUND! Your family or friends might receive the same call. Be Safe and Stay Alert! Please pass around to your famil y and friends!,0

Hi every body; My employers have submitted my documents with the immigration office to process my entry work visa. I was told by my HR people that it might take any time between one -15 days for the process. My position has been approved by the internal committee and all documents are in place including PCC. Does any body have an idea of the kind of time it takes. I will appreciate your inputs. hornbill,0

Hi I have been on line and obtained visit visas for my family. When I printed them of I noticed that the passport expiry date on my sons visa is not correct. I have rang Hukoomi and they said I needed to ring immigration but have been told they do not speak English. I got a friend to ring for me and after trying to get through for over an hour (no one answering the telephone) they said they would put him through to someone else and then he got cut off. Does anyone know if not having the correct expiry date of the passport will effect him getting into the country.,0
The day I met you I found a friend - And a friendship that I pray will never end. Your smile - so sweet And so bright - Kept me going When day was as dark as night. You never ever judged me; You understood my sorrow. Then you told me it needn't be that way And gave me the hope of a better tomorrow. You were always there for me; I knew I could count on you. You gave me advice and encouragement Whenever I didn't know what to do. You helped me learn to love myself You made life seem so good. You said I can do anything I put my mind to And suddenly I knew I could. There were times when we didn't see eye to eye And there were days when both of us cried. But even so we made it through: Our friendship hasn't yet died. Circumstances have pulled us apart; We are separated by many miles. Truly; the only thing that keeps me going Is my treasured memory of your smile. This friendship we share Is so precious to me; I hope it grows and flourishes And lasts unto infinity. You are so extra-special to me And so this to you I really must tell: You are my one true friend; My Guardian Angel. Our friendship is one-in-a-million So let's hold on to it and each other. We cannot let this chance of pure bliss fly away For there will never be another. I love you. I will always love you.,0
If you do...let me know...thanks.,0

Doctor raped woman; court told September 29; 2010 04:37:59 PMA+ A-| || An Australian doctor allegedly raped a woman seven times in one night; a jury has been told. The Victoria woman claimed that Arvind Sharma raped her feigned and that she had passed out after he allegedly attacked her in an attempt to stop his actions; a Victorian County Court jury heard. Sharma pleaded not guilty to seven counts of rape and three of indecent assault arising from the alleged incident in December 2006 at his Bendigo home. He claims the sex was consensual. Opening the Crown case; prosecutor Jim Bessell told the jury of 10 men and two women that Sharma and the complainant were known to each other and had previously had sex. He said the woman had told Sharma she felt unwell after drinking a Midori and lemonade while they were nightclubbing with friends. They had argued about returning to his house. After lying on his bed; the woman again argued with Sharma and rolled away from him; wanting to go to sleep; Mr Bessell said. He said that the woman felt Sharma's hands on her side and he began rubbing her side: ''She knew this action suggested he indicated interest in having sex'' but she declined his advances; Mr Bessell said. The alleged attack on the woman began when she was close to sleep; the prosecutor said; but she stayed still ''as though passed out; in the hope that he would think she was out of it and he would stop''. The woman was raped seven times and indecently assaulted three times; Mr Bessell told the jury; saying that Sharma had been ''rough'' with her. Before the pair went out; the woman had dropped an overnight bag off; intending to stay the night; Mr Bessell said. After Sharma fell asleep following the alleged incident; she text messaged a friend; who took her to the police station. Defence counsel Rodney Willcox said while both Sharma and the woman had been drinking; both were aware of what was going on. He said Sharma did not undress the woman against her will; but both had undressed themselves. ''The defence say there was no rape and indeed; there was no indecent assault;'' Mr Willcox told the jury. ''She did not at any stage object from the alleged incidents. She did not voice her concern; she didn't leave the house at any stage during; or immediately after; the alleged incident. ''She was aware and she was alert and she pretended to be asleep.'' Mr Bessell said the woman could recall seeing the flash of Sharma's mobile phone camera while he was allegedly assaulting her; even though her eyes were closed. The trial before Judge Frank Shelton continues today.,0

The future is here.. Although I personaly do not see the point of a pilotless passenger craft.. Question: Would you fly in such an aircrft? ___________ AN unmanned plane has flown in British airspace for the first time &#8212; paving the way for pilotless passenger flights. The BAE Jetstream executive craft travelled 300 miles from Warton; Lancs; to Inverness in Scotland. A ground-based pilot manoeuvred the plane using a computer. A BAE director said: &#8220;We are writing a new chapter in aviation history. Unmanned aircraft are likely to become a part of everyday life in the near future.&#8221; More trials will be carried out in the next five years after the success of last month&#8217;s flight.,0

In celebration of their good luck they agree to put their differences aside from that moment on and the Welshman goes to the boot and fetches a 12 yr old bottle of whiskey. He hands it to the Englishman who exclaims; ""may the English and Welsh live together forever in peace and harmony"" and then gulps down half the bottle.

The FBI had an opening for an assassin. After all the background checks; interviews and testing were done; there were 3 finalists; Two men and a woman. For the final test; the FBI agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed Him a gun. 'We must know that you will follow your Instructions no matter what the circumstances. Inside the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair ... Kill her!!' The man said; 'You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife.' The agent said; 'Then you're not the right man for this job. Take your wife and go home.' The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was Quiet for a bout 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes; 'I tried; but I can't kill my wife.' The agent said; 'You don't Have what it takes. Take your wife and go home.' Finally; it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions; to kill her husband. She took the Gun and went into the room. Shots were heard; one After another. They heard screaming; crashing; Banging on the walls. After a few minutes; all was Quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the Woman; wiping the sweat from her brow. 'This gun is loaded with blanks' she said. 'I had to beat him to death with the chair.' MORAL:. Don't mess with &#8220;WOMAN&#8221;,0

"The Alaskan town where Sarah Palin once served as mayor charged alleged rape victims for forensic examinations; it has emerged. Wasilla was one of a handful of places in the state that billed members of the public or their insurance companies for test kits costing up to &#163;600. Charlie Fannon; the police chief hired by the first female Republican vice-presidential nominee; complained about burdening taxpayers with the cost when the practice was banned in 2000 by the state legislature. ""It was one of those things everyone could agree on except Wasilla;"" Eric Croft; the Democrat who sponsored the legislation; told CNN. ""We couldn't convince the chief of police to stop charging them."" A spokesman for her campaign denied that Mrs Palin; a mother of five; knew about the practice and said she was against it in principle. But Mr Croft said he believed that Mrs Palin; who was elected Alaska's governor in 2006; was not ignorant of the issue; given that it was under public discussion for six months prior to the bill being passed. Critics have said her failure to stop the practices while she was mayor from 1996 to 2002 undermined Mrs Palin's claims that she has worked to reduce sexual assaults. Alaska routinely has the highest rate of sexual assault in the United States; two and a half times the national average. After the law passed; Mr Fannon told the Frontiersman newspaper: ""In the past; we've charged the cost of the exams to the victim's insurance company when possible. I just don't want to see any more burden on the taxpayer.""",0

"India should give political asylum to American whistleblower Edward Snowden for exposing the US cyber snooping programme that targeted India in a big way; WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said. Assange; who is holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since June 19 last year; said in an exclusive interview that India was among the first countries he had approached for asylum. But he never heard back. ""I was disappointed and saddened that India; known for upholding human rights; never got back despite several requests by me for asylum. Indians are also great supporters of WikiLeaks. I therefore contacted the foreign office through the Indian high commissioner. I wrote to them but they never responded;"" Assange said. The WikiLeaks founder said that if a small nation like Ecuador could have the guts to provide him asylum; India which has considerable global standing with a billion-plus population should not be afraid of ""standing up for human rights"" and giving Snowden asylum. ""Ecuadorians showed immense courage and granted me asylum;"" he added. Assange called Snowden a hero for exposing ""the most serious events of the decade"" &#8212; how America was snooping into people's emails; phone calls; messages en masse and across the globe. ""It was because of Snowden that India came to know how US was snooping on them. It is an obligation for India to protect Snowden. Now is the time for India to show it stands up for human rights;"" he said. Assange warned Snowden against serious witch-hunting by the US government. The Australian information activist; who is trying to avoid extradition to face ""trumped up"" charges of sexual offences in Sweden; said he is still willing to take asylum in India if such an offer comes. WikiLeaks has a big support base in India. But the government should show more courage;"" Assange said.",0

"Qatar has grown and developed so quickly and massively in the last few years. Its economy; government and people are forces to be reckoned with; locally and in the international arena. There is innovation; imagination and enthusiasm to be found in all aspects of Qatari society as well as in the expat community that calls Qatar its home. There is also much respect for the leaders of this tiny up-and-coming business center. They have demonstrated vision for the development of the country and a concern for their countrymen by educating them and putting them to work to continue the building of their own country. Qatar has been described as a country which ""champion(s) the cause of freedom"". (The Peninsula; Oct 11; 2010). Meanwhile; Qatar has also invited hundreds of thousands of workers&#8212;skilled and unskilled&#8212;to lend a hand in the building of Qatar. While some of these workers succeed in tucking away tidy nest eggs and returning to their own countries better off; there are others who struggle to realize their earnings or even a decent standard of living while they are here. Much of a worker's fate depends on the benevolence; or lack thereof; of his sponsor&#8212;his salary; living conditions and dismissal&#8212;so much so that the sponsorship system has been compared to modern-day slavery. Some countries have realized that the sponsorship system for workers is outdated; antiquated and unfair to workers. Perhaps those same countries have already realized benefits of having more satisfied foreign workers. Bahrain has done away with the sponsorship structure and Kuwait is scheduled to retire it in February 2011. In keeping with its vision and progressive thinking; Qatar needs to do away with the sponsorship scheme that it has been using up to now. Rather than feeling fearful of allowing workers and employers to move freely between companies without the 2 year penalty; both parties can be relieved of the misery of feeling stuck with an unhappy partner. Employees who aspire to better themselves or look for new challenges can find new opportunities and can take advantage of them; contributing their skills and expertise in a competitive atmosphere; rather than feeling stifled and abused by an archaic system. An important segment of the present working population; namely educated; skilled professionals; will inevitably start feeling resentment towards sponsors who refuse to release them to pursue other opportunities. While seemingly in control of people's fates; Qatar will eventually start losing real talent to other countries; especially to those countries that have eased or will ease the unfair restrictions that make up the sponsorship regulations. Qatar will end up losing talented; knowledgeable professionals because of a stubborn refusal to give up that relatively small amount of control&#8212;a control that is not a fundamental right for employers or sponsors to begin with. From an Islamic perspective; it is wrong for one person to have such control over another; man is free and should not be a slave to another. Islam has clear guidelines and parameters; one need only consult a scholar for ahadith and Qur'anic verses that would present support for an end to the practice of sponsorship in its current form. With a competitive system; employers would be forced into better treatment of their workers in order to retain their valued staff. The result will be a more contented workforce and better products; both of which are beneficial for the employer. The resistance to a change in the present legislation could only be construed as a worrisome fear that employers would actually have to provide things for their employees that; heretofore; they have been able to overlook; i.e.; proper living situations; salaries paid on time and in full; and the choice by an employee to stay or leave for a different position. No one wins when an undervalued employee is retained against his will. If Qatar is the new &#8220;land of opportunity&#8221; for expats; it is also still the land of perceived slave owners who are unwilling to give up their grasp on the chains that bind their employees and keep them subservient. That grasp enables sponsors to keep their workers tied to them&#8212;but only until the employees have outlived their usefulness. There is no dignity to be found in an environment such as this. Slavery goes against human dignity and is also against the spirit of Islam. Qatar needs to fulfill its role as a leader in the region by setting a new standard&#8212;a standard of human rights that was established by Islam. Qatar has nothing to lose and everything to gain by eradicating this most detestable example of all human indignities; the modern day slavery that we call the sponsorship law.",0

I am new on QL and have noticed that its quite popular among residents of Qatar. I would like to remind people to please drive carefully on the roads and follow traffic rules. Its really shocking to see that people have no respect for fellow drivers; even for cars with babies/ children in them! I was almost hit this morning by a reckless driver driving on 80kmph on a small road in residential area; who did not look at the STOP sign stuck on his side of the road and just drove zipping past me. I drive with my baby (5 months old) in his car-seat; so I don't drive in a high speed and stick to the speed limit allowed for roads; which is why he missed hitting me. Had I been in the same speed as him; he would have hit my car really hard. I expect people to respect the 'Baby on board' sign that is stuck on cars. I was so angry with this driver and would have followed his car to slap him really hard; had my baby not been with me in the car. I just wanted to vent out my anger thats why I'm posting it here and I'm sure there are many of you that have experienced this situation before. Please drive safely.,0
My earliest memories of Ramadan go back to my second or third grade year. But back then I remember Ramadan fell during winter; which meant fairly short days rather than the long burn of summer we&#8217;re experiencing today. The fast day normally ended around 5.30 and by 6:30 we would have prayed Maghrib and I&#8217;m already settled in front of the TV for another hilarious dose of the American Comedy Show &#8220; full house&#8221; and &#8220;wonder years&#8221; while munching on some Mama made Ramadan goodies. But the old days Ramadan was so much different so much fun; well at least for me!. Old days Ramadan wasn&#8217;t just about not eating and drinking forever! For us little folks it was more about motions. We awaited the month with lots of excitement and appreciated its gravity. We spend the day playing between studying and playing football and watching Ramadan kid&#8217;s quiz shows on TV with my cousins. And when night fell over we celebrated our Iftar with relief and gratitude. Mom&#8217;s Knafa never tasted so good. (: it still does actually: P There was a closeness I long to recapture. There are other things I also remember from my childhood Ramadan (: The subtle ache in my belly :P The memory of that first day of Ramadan sneaking in to the kitchen for a bite only to end up being caught by someone ( usually the elder females because they are fussing about the kitchen to make sure Iftar is ready and on time. And then The excitement we little kids felt about accompanying our families to the Tarwahi prayers and all the other little things we enjoyed doing like setting the Iftar table every day. It felt a bit like it felt like my favorite TV show &#8220;Full House&#8221; were the table was set and the family ate together sharing jokes and laughing. I took care of making the juices the napkins; setting out the table and distrusting plates and spoons to everyone It looked stupid but I loved it :P mom thought was ok tough (: These were the memories that made my childhood Ramadan experiences I will never ever really forget. And this is really the essential message of Ramadan; is to be thankful feeling pleasure after deprivation. The sense that what I&#8217;m doing might not change the world; but if it changes me and my perspective of life then it&#8217;s good enough. Now as an adult; I feel Ramadan is slowly losing its meaning; I have at times felt like it&#8217;s been capitalized; commercialized and deluded amid the demands of a capitalistic lifestyle. Relationships and pressures are never the problem; living in a &#8216;non-Muslim&#8217; country where it&#8217;s the exception to fast; not the norm; poses its share of challenges in the workplace. But good news is as adults we still excited about Ramadan and talk about it with anticipation and expectations.,0

Three women die together in an accident And go to heaven. When they get there; St. Peter says; 'We only have one rule here in heaven: Don't step on the ducks!' So they enter heaven; and sure enough; There are ducks all over the place. It is almost impossible not to step on a duck; and although they try their best to avoid them; the first woman accidentally steps on one. Along comes St. Peter with the ugliest man she ever saw. St. Peter chains them together and says; 'Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly man!' The next day; the second woman steps accidentally on a duck and along comes St. Peter; who doesn't miss a thing. With him is another extremely ugly man. He chains them together with the same admonishment as for the first woman. The third woman has observed all this and; not wanting to be chained for all eternity to an ugly man; is very; VERY careful where she steps. She manages to go months without stepping on any ducks; but one day St.Peter comes up to her with the most handsome man she has ever laid eyes on .... Very tall; long eyelashes; muscular. St. Peter chains them together without saying a word. The happy woman says; 'I wonder what I did to deserve being chained to you for all of eternity?'

Good reasons not to fly Air Frog or drink too much ... :O) An air hostess is facing ten years in prison after admitting stealing from business class passengers as they slept on long-haul flights. The 47-year-old was dubbed the &#8216;Mile High Pickpocket&#8217; after being caught following complaints about missing money; credit cards and designer jewellery. She would rifle through pockets and handbags; helping herself to the equivalent of &#163;3;700 in notes on one flight alone. The 47-year-old Air France employee was caught following complaints about missing cash; credit cards and jewellery &#8216;She knew that many of the passengers would fall asleep following a large meal and lots of alcohol. &#8216;This is the time that she would start rifling through their property; helping herself to whatever she could find.&#8217; The defendant; known for legal reasons solely as Lucie R; was finally arrested when she got off a Tokyo to Paris flight at 4.30am last Friday. Police had corroborated her flight rota with the huge number of crimes being reported. When confronted with the evidence against her; she confessed to 26 different thefts; during which everything from antique watches to cheque books were taken. Detectives charged her with the 26 offences while suggesting that numerous other thefts &#8216;undoubtedly took place&#8217;. He said that colleagues had also become suspicious of Lucie R&#8217;s lavish lifestyle. Despite officially earning less than &#163;40;000 a year; she regularly turned up for work in a top-of-the-range sports car and was buying plush apartments close to the airports where she worked. Detectives also raided a bank deposit box in her home town of Rouen; western France; where Lucie R had hidden stolen property including Cartier jewellery. The woman is currently in custody in Paris and is expected to appear before examining magistrates later this week. Source: DAily Mail,0

Do you agree or disagree with Seize of Passport + Denial of Exit = SLAVERY ? As some people have posted here.. that they alway take their life positive.

I'm writing the following just warn all QL readers to be careful with their belongings; especially NOT TO LEAVE ANYTHING of value outside your homes on the porch or in your backyards or inside the cars. My road bike was stolen on 24th of December 2011; from right outside my house garage in the early morning hours. The Bike was parked and locked outside our house garage. So I never believed that it will be robbed in Qatar; because we live in a compound with security grads controlled gates and everything. .. However it happened. And From my observations and the way that the scum carried out their robbery; I&#8217;m pretty much convinced that; whoever stole the bike; they must have been watching and surveilling the house and the bike for a while; and must have had someone from inside the compound ( probably the grads) helping covering up for them while they carried out the robbery. Don't let this happen to you too. In the unfortunate case that it does happen to you; and if the garage was not broken in; go to Capital Police immediately. Does not touch anything in the garage or outside; they will take fingerprints from it?,0
DUBAI: In a bid to reform its labour market; the UAE has introduced a new work permit which will allow foreign workers; including Indians; in the country to switch jobs after two years without facing a six-month ban for leaving their work. Expatriate workers in the UAE who have received a six-month ban on leaving their jobs recently will be able to obtain new work permits from the beginning of the new year; a senior official has said. The new work permit will be issued only if they have completed two years with their former employers; Humaid Bin Deemas; Acting Director-General at the Ministry of Labour; said.,0

First-year students at Veterinary school were attending their first Anatomy class; with a real dead animal. They all gathered around the surgery table with the body covered with a White sheet. The professor started the class by telling them; 'In Veterinary Medicine it is necessary to have two important qualities as a Doctor: The first is that you not be disgusted by anything involving the Animal body'. For an example; the Professor pulled back the sheet; touched his finger in the mouth of the dead animal; withdrew it and put his Finger in his mouth. 'Go ahead and do the same thing;' he told his students. The students freaked out; hesitated for several minutes. But eventually took turns putting their finger in the mouth of the dead pig and tasted in their mouth. When everyone finished; the Professor looked at them and said; 'The Second most important quality is observation. I touched with my middle Finger and tasted on my index finger. Now learn to pay attention Moral of the story: Life is Tough but its a lot tougher when you are stupid,0

DOHA: Long criticised for non-existent enforcement of anti-smoking law; Qatar&#8217;s public health authorities have swung into action and handed out fines to some 829 people so far this year for lighting up in public places. And the fines the health inspectors collected from the violators totalled an impressive QR319;000 &#8212; which means that on average a smoker caught paid QR385 in fine. The places raided by the inspectors included popular hangouts like the City Centre; The Mall; Villaggio; Hyatt Plaza; Landmark and Royal Plaza; among others. Interestingly; the health inspectors didn&#8217;t spare government offices; including ministry buildings; and raided them as well and caught violators. Responsible for ensuring a smoke-free Qatar; the Supreme Council of Health (SCH) said in a release yesterday that inspectors from its anti-tobacco unit conducted 1;330 raids between January and mid-November this year at public places where smoking is banned. The SCH has reiterated in its release it would intensify monitoring and conduct more raids; especially as many violators were caught in shops located closer to schools. The SCH campaign assumes significance as it comes ahead of a law that is reported to be on the anvil; and; which many expect; could see the mushrooming &#8216;sheesha&#8217; joints; especially in residential localities and near schools; close down. During the latest anti-tobacco campaign of the SCH; however; what is surprising is that no &#8216;sheesha&#8217; outlet has been raided by its inspectors and no fines have been handed out to users to &#8216;sheesha&#8217; addicts; who; understandably; also include an increasing number of women and children. The current anti-tobacco law is described by anti-smoking activists as weak and lacking teeth as the punitive measures provided for are not deterring enough. Official figures suggest that some 16 percent of the Qatari population is addicted to smoking; and that includes &#8216;sheesha&#8217; as well. School students aren&#8217;t immune. A survey has recently been conducted by public health authorities to determine the extent to which smoking is prevalent in schools. Its findings are expected to help the SCH come up with ways that are effective enough in fighting this menace among youngsters. The authorities have recently made it mandatory for cigarette packets being sold in the local market to carry graphic images of deadly ailments smoking can cause; but its impact on the prevalence of smoking in the country is yet to be assessed. Some youngsters; instead of kicking the habit; have begun buying small steel &#8212; and sometimes silver &#8212; boxes so they could shift the cigarettes from what is a repulsive looking pack to a fancy case.

Two men; both seriously ill; occupied the same hospital room. One man was allowed to sit up in his bed for an hour each afternoon to help drain the fluid from his lungs. His bed was next to the room's only window. The other man had to spend all his time flat on his back. The men talked for hours on end. They spoke of their wives and families; their homes; their jobs; their involvement in the military service; where they had been on vacation.. Every afternoon; when the man in the bed by the window could sit up; he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window. The man in the other bed began to live for those one hour periods where his world would be broadened and enlivened by all the activity and colour of the world outside. The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake.Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every colour and a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance. As the man by the window described all this in exquisite details; the man on the other side of the room would close his eyes and imagine this picturesque scene. One warm afternoon; the man by the window described a parade passing by. Although the other man could not hear the band - he could see it in his mind's eye as the gentleman by the window portrayed it with descriptive words. Days; weeks and months passed. One morning; the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths only to find the lifeless body of the man by the window; who had died peacefully in his sleep. She was saddened and called the hospital attendants to take the body away. As soon as it seemed appropriate; the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch; and after making sure he was comfortable; she left him alone. Slowly; painfully; he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the real world outside. He strained to slowly turn to look out the window besides the bed. It faced a blank wall. The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his deceased roommate who had described such wonderful things outside this window. The nurse responded that the man was blind and could not even see the wall. She said; 'Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you.' Epilogue: There is tremendous happiness in making others happy; despite our own situations. Shared grief is half the sorrow; but happiness when shared; is doubled. If you want to feel rich; just count all the things you have that money can't buy. 'Today is a gift; that is why it is called The Present .' The origin of this letter is unknown; but please pass it on.,0
Well ; it s about time for something to be done about this Global djs thing in doha .enough abuse of these youngsters who find their escape to the adult world through these events . rave parties are made for certain people and require certain needs i know most of you know what i am taking about.however everytime i have attended any global djs events i was faced by an army of youngsters who are not even 17 ; which is against the qatari law that insists that people to be able to attend such venues should be over 21 for both gendres . moreover it s so sad that the people from the diplomatic club or from certain undercover officials are just letting this thing happen under their eyes.....why !!! in the last event i was at .. loads of these underage people were vomitting non stop and it was everywhere.....is this how we want the youth of doha to be raised ....!!! anyway just for eveyone s info ; it seems diplomatic club have had serious complaints about that issue and is stopping this global dj thing ... hope whenever someone wants to do an event&#160; ...

It is best to start weaning yourself off your daily fixes well before Ramadan to minimise cravings. What to eat and what to avoid this Ramadan --------------------------------------------------------- Have a light meal: Do not stuff yourself with food and drinks during or between Iftar and Suhoor. This contradicts the spirit of Ramadan and defeats the whole object of fasting. Health problems can emerge as a result of excess food intake which can &#8216;clog&#8217; your digestive system. At Iftar it is advisable to have a very light meal first &#8212; like dates and juices or soup and reserve the main meal for later after the Maghrib prayers perhaps or even after Taraweeh (special night prayers). The body&#8217;s immediate need is to get water and an easily available energy source in the form of glucose for every living cell; particularly the brain. What to eat: Due to the long hours of fasting; we should consume slow digesting foods including fibre-containing foods (which last up to 8 hours) rather than fast-digesting foods (which last for only 3-4 hours). Slow digesting foods contain grains and seeds like barley; wheat; oats; millet; semolina; beans; lentils; whole meal flour; unpolished rice; etc (called complex carbohydrates). Fibre-containing foods are bran; whole wheat; grains and seeds; vegetables like green beans; peas; spinach; the leaves of beetroot (iron-rich); fruit with skin; dried fruit especially dried apricots; and prunes; almonds; etc. Foods to avoid: Anything hot; spicy; hot or salty. Too much salty food will make your body retain water and give you the feeling of being bloated; while spicy foods also induce thirst. Sweets and sugary foods are fast-burning and will only last for 3-4 hours. Moreover; these will turn into fat; increase cholesterol levels and make you gain weight. Fried foods are unhealthy and should be limited. They cause indigestion; heartburn and weight problems. -------------------------------------------------------- What to drink: Drink sufficient water between Iftar and bedtime to avoid dehydration. Drinks with high caffeine content (coffee; tea; chocolate; sodas and even decaffeinated teas and coffees) should be avoided. Caffeine leaches calcium from your system; which means you feel less full all the time. Avoid drinking tea at suhoor (dawn); as tea increases salt excretion in the urine; which is needed for your body during fasting. --------------------------------------------------------- Do not skip Suhoor: Dieticians warn that those who are fasting should not skip the morning meal as this is needed to get you through the day. Many people eat a late night meal and sleep through till the dawn prayers. This is not advisable. Self-discipline: As Ramadan fasting is basically an exercise in self-discipline; for those who are chain smokers; food nibblers or caffeine addicts (coffee; tea; coke; and chocolate); it is a good opportunity to break the habit; hoping that the effect will continue when the month is over. It is best to start weaning yourself off your daily fixes well before Ramadan to minimise cravings. --------------------------------------------------------- Fasting and weight loss: Fasting is a good way of losing weight; however some people even put on weight during Ramadan. The basic equation is simple &#8211; you must balance the calories that you take in with the calories that go out. If you consistently eat more calories than you burn; you will tend to store up the excess as fat. Exercising will help you maintain your body weight; it will help burn calories and get rid of stress. ---------------------------------------------------------,0

My husband brought me and my 2 yr old son almost 6 mos ago through Family visit visa. He was supposed to work out our Resident Visa but unfortunately law changed and salary req't became Qr10000.

"Qatari Premier and Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem al-Thani (C) at a recent meeting in Libya. Photograph: AFP DOHA - Qatar is considering ending the oft-criticised sponsorship system; under which employers sponsor foreign workers and have a great deal of control over them; the prime minister said on Thursday. ""Changes have been made to the sponsorship system in Qatar;"" and the council of ministers is ""seriously studying"" abolishing the system; Sheikh Hamad told reporters. ""We are studying the issue very carefully to preserve the rights of citizens and foreign workers;"" he added. Sponsorship systems for foreign workers exist in most Gulf countries; which employ millions of foreigners; especially from Asia. The system has been strongly criticised by rights groups and likened to modern-day slavery. In some cases; employers hold workers' passports and can deny them permission to change jobs. Bahrain abolished the system in 2009; and Kuwait reportedly plans to do so by February. Sheikh Hamad also said on Thursday that Qatar was not yet ready to hold its first partial parliamentary elections; which have been promised for several years. ""The legislative elections will be held one day... We have fallen behind in completing various laws; of which three quarters have been adopted;"" he said. The principle of a partly elected parliament was enshrined in the Gulf state's constitution which came into force in 2005. Two-thirds of the 45 members of the Majlis al-Shura (consultative assembly) would be selected by universal suffrage; with the other 15 appointed by the emir; according to an electoral law adopted in 2008.",0

According to police; the woman; from India; committed suicide on Sunday in an apartment where she was living with her family in the Al Khan area. The woman was apparently dejected after her family told her that she could not marry the man of her choice; a senior Sharjah Police official said. The official said the woman was reportedly in love with a man but her family had refused to accept him or approve of their marriage plans. ""She always had heated arguments and disputes with her family in order to get their approval;"" the official said. Article continues below Investigation The woman was found with deep gashes on her forearms and &#8216;I love you' scrawled on the wall of her room in her own blood next to the name of her boyfriend; said the official. The victim had also reportedly tied one end of a sari around her neck and the other end to the ceiling fan in her room. The family is believed to have called in the police after making the horrific discovery. A police ambulance transferred the woman's body to Al Kuwaiti Hospital around 2.30am and then transferred it to the forensic laboratory; the official said. The police have launched an investigation into the case. The victim's family is waiting for the body to be handed over to them; said the official.",0

I have been offered a job at Qatar Petroleum IT department. However I have told by a couple of relations in the company that there are some serious politics going on between the Manager of IT Department and Director of QP Administration. Both are local; but DA is from the royal family and he is winning the cold war by neglecting the general and administrative requirements of the department. Due to this IT department staff is suffering seriously. They recommended not to join this department.,0

Words from the Past There will be plenty of moments in your life when you might have said something to someone; at that time the words just came up in your mind and you just said them bluntly but later on the true meaning of those; you will come to know when you have really learned the lesson of life in a hard way. Yes everyone does that in their life these things sometime arise suddenly and will put a smile on your face. Because you come to realize that how important you were to someone then. There are many moments in my life where I have said something to someone. Ah! It&#8217;s a bitter truth that we cannot change our past. Smart people in this world do not live in their past but it does not mean that they have totally come out of it. It&#8217;s just they have learned the art of staying well in the present and they always try to create such events / moments that they had in their past without anyone noticing it. Qaisar,0
Think that there is a nice and rich country somewhere in world. Everybody says this country is fairer and the people who lives there believe the God too much.

She is very happy because she is healthy she can care her family she have good job and she is giving her everything to company even some nights she is working at home for company. At That company the GM have a son who have down sendrom but only 25% because he can use computer ; cameras ; all office machines and even he have account on facebook. But this guy when grew he starts the sexual harasment to this lady. And the lady inform the GM about this many times. But GM doesnt give up to bring his son to office. One day he is doing really bad things to her and she is calling the call center of police station. After tell everything also she says i dont want to work for this company anymore. Call center says ok dont work go out now and go to nearest police station for to complain.She do what the police said her and goes to police station. First time the police doesnt want to accept her complain because the GM`s son is sick. After long hours they accept the complain. She gives 4 witness name and 1 cd and they open a case. Also she says there i dont want to work for this company anymore. The police says ok dont work there is no problem until finish the case. And she goes back to home which company provided for her.

"Bahrain girl reads freedom poem; jailed Bahrain's security forces are increasingly targeting women in their campaign against prodemocracy protesters despite Wednesday's lifting martial law in the island kingdom. Ayat al-Gormezi ; 20; a poet and student arrested two months ago after reading out a poem at a prodemocracy rally; is due to go on trial before a military tribunal ; her mother said. Ayat was forced to turn herself in when masked cops threatened to kill her brothers unless she did so. She has not been seen since her arrest ; though her mother did talk to her once by phone and Ayat said that she had been forced to sign a false confession . Her mother has since been told that her daughter has been in a military hospital after being tortured. ""We are the people who will kill humiliation and assassinate misery;"" a film captures Ayat telling a cheering crowd in Pearl Square in February. ""We are the people who will destroy the foundation of injustice.""",0

"I don't know if I consider this day as a lucky or unlucky or both (maybe!) day for me. For how many times; we almost had an accident three or four times because of the reckless; undisciplined ""muk mafi"" drivers who are seem like cows on the loose. Darn! I was holding to my dear seat and held my breath as I waited for the head-on collision that happened somewhere in salwa road this morning. I don't know if there's a divine intervention but miraculously seems like time elapsed and my driver had a chance to turn the car on the left side. My God I can't imagine if the other car had bumped us and crashed us like a canned soda. I'm sure I'll be a dead meat by now. This just brings me down to the memory lane; reminiscing the first ever accident I had and the worst is it happened here in Doha. Having a first hand accident is one of the worst part of my life. I just can't forget that fateful day of February when our company car was bumped by a speeding car and to think that he's suppose not to run fast in an intersection right? I had to wait for almost one hour for the ambulance and the police to arrive on the scene and to investigate the accident. Seems like eternity after the rescuers arrived and brought me to the hospital. During the travel to Hamad Hospital; my life flashes back before me. My family; my friends; my colleagues; the happy and sad episodes of my life played like a rerun movie..This really brings chill down to my spine..Sometimes; because of this worst scenario in the road here in Doha; I almost quit my job and pursue a new one only if not of this sponsorship that's holding my neck that I can't able to resign despite that I really wanted to..Meeting our clients is always a deem part of my job -- unfortunately..Anyhow; as I analyze the circumstances I realized I'M STILL LUCKY after all because I still have the chance to make things right and I still had a chance to live and to do what's my purpose why I'm here right now..I know that it will take time that the traumas of my accidents will vanish into thin air but I won't let this impede me to do what I ought to do..Thanks God I'm still alive and kicking and thanks for George Cayley for inventing the seatbelt that always saved my life for not crashing in the windshield and flew out..lol..To make a joke of the situation; sometimes I always kid my colleagues that I must do a last will of testament before something bad will happen to me..It's always like your one foot is in the grave whenever you're in the road here in Doha..",0

Wow; just bing glad I woke up this morning and saw my cat pooping at all! After struggling for 2 days cat and seeing nothing in the litterbox; I'm happy when there's anything! I suspect that cats are like people in that how often they poop can vary a lot. Mine poops once every blue moon! And According to her vet; a cat should poop once daily and it should be solid. But this one is being so very secretive about it sometimes! I can't even tell they pooped!!! So how many times do cats usually go poop a day? Cheers;,0

Very nice and a beautiful morning today. Just wanna write something motivational which will help me and many of you as well. Well&#8230; Lemme start with a story which I heard from one of my mentor long back. &#8220;&#8220;&#8220;&#8220;Once a young man was trying to do suicide to kill himself and was blaming God and others for not helping him. An greybeard man was hearing his words. Their conversation goes like that. Greybeard Man : Hi Stop please don&#8217;t do that. Young Man : Ohh no Why should I stop. What is life all about . I don&#8217;t have anything to live so its better to die than live with nothing. Greybeard Man : Ok Man. I will give you 10;000 bucks if you gimme your eyes. Young Man : No way I cant live see without my eyes. Greybeard Man : Ok I will give you 10;000 bucks if you gimme your kidneys. Young Man : Ohh no I cant live without my kidneys. Greybeard Man then repeated all the important parts of his body and asked him to sell them for money but the man was continuously denying to do that. Then the greybeard man told the young man that just in your body you are having things which worth millions but still you are ungrateful. Be happy with what you have and do hard work and live your life.&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221; Hence sometimes we just don&#8217;t realize/utilize what we have and just blame others. Sometimes we just see the container and don&#8217;t really understand what really contains in it. So it is better to start every day with a goal to push forward to be a good being. Wish you all great week ahead.,0

To avoid personal embarrassment; please note that the concerned individuals will be spoken to personally and asked to take immediate remedial action. As advised earlier; could you all please ensure that: &#8226; You wash daily; &#8226; You wash your clothes; &#8226; Use a good deodorant; Thank you all for your understanding; and compliance. Apologies for any inconvenience/discomfort this may cause.,0

Wife is like a TV; Girlfriend is like a MOBILE . At home u watch TV; But when u go out u take ur MOBILE. No money; u sell the TV; Got money u change ur MOBILE. Sometimes u enjoy TV; But most of the time u play with ur MOBILE. TV is free for life; But for the MOBILE ; if you don't pay; the services will be terminated. TV is big; bulky and most of the time old; But the MOBILE is cute; slim; curvy and very portable. Operational costs for TV is often acceptable; But for the MOBILE it is often high and demanding. TV has a remote; MOBILE doesn't. Most importantly; MOBILE is a two-way communication (u talk and listen); But with the TV you MUST only listen (whether you want to or not). Last but not least .. TVs don't have viruses; But MOBILEs often do!,0

Dutch Muslims have offered to guard three Coptic churches in the Netherlands which have been threatened on an Al Qaeda-linked website after a New Year&#8217;s Day bombing attack killed 21 Coptic Christians in Egypt. The Dutch Muslim Council; the Council of Moroccan Mosques in the Netherlands and the Federation of Islamic Organisations &#8220;offer protection&#8221; to three Dutch Coptic churches which were among 50 in Egypt and Europe threatened on a list on an Al Qaeda-linked website; they said in a statement. The Dutch Islamic groups promised to ensure that &#8220;Muslims are ready to guard the three churches; in Amsterdam; Utrecht and Eindhoven; against the threat by Al Qaeda&#8221;. Gulf-Times 5/1/11 My comment: I think that this is a great idea. Specially after someone said: Not all Muslims are terrorists but most terrorists are Muslims. I hope to see this spirit of protecting one another from those vile terrorists; spread across the world; specially West Europe and USA. No man is an island. We all need one another irrespective of creed; religion; skin colour BUT we surely don't need terrorists.,0

"How to Maintain a Healthy Level of Insanity in the Workplace 1) Page yourself over the intercom. Don't disguise your voice. 2) Find out where your boss shops and buy exactly the same outfits. Wear them one day after you boss does. This is especially effective if your boss is a different gender. 3) Make up nicknames for all your coworkers and refer to them only by these names. ""That's a good point; Sparky."" ""No; I'm sorry; but I'm going to have to disagree with you there; Cha-cha."" 4) Send e-mail to the rest of the company telling them exactly what you're doing. For example: ""If anyone needs me; I'll be in the bathroom."" 5) Hi-Lite your shoes. Tell people you haven't lost them as much since you did this. 6) Hang mosquito netting around your cubicle. When you emerge to get coffee or a printout or whatever; slap yourself randomly the whole way. 7) Put a chair facing a printer. Sit there all day and tell people you're waiting for your document. 8) Every time someone asks you to do something; anything; ask them if they want fries with that. 9) Encourage your colleagues to join you in a little synchronized chair-dancing. 10) Put your trash can on your desk. Label it ""IN."" 11) Feign an unnatural and hysterical fear of staplers. 12) Send e-mail messages saying there's free pizza or donuts or cake in the lunch room. When people drift back to work complaining that they found none; lean back; pat your stomach and say; ""Oh you've got to be faster than that."" 13) Put decaf in the coffee maker for three weeks. Once everyone has withdrawn from caffeine addiction; switch to espresso.",0

"Caracas: Venezuela ordered Israel's ambassador expelled from the country on Tuesday in protest over the Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip. The decision by President Hugo Chavez to kick out the diplomat appeared to be the strongest reaction yet to the Gaza offensive by any country with ties to Israel. The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry announced the move in a statement; saying it ""has decided to expel the Israeli ambassador and part of the Israeli Embassy's personnel."" The Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed nearly 600 Palestinians in ground and air strikes. Israel launched the attacks Dec. 27 to stop Palestinian militants from firing rockets into southern Israel. ""How far will this barbarism go?"" Chavez asked on state television before the ambassador's expulsion was announced. ""The president of Israel should be taken before an international court together with the president of the United States; if the world had any conscience."" Venezuela's Foreign Ministry said its U.N. mission is joining with other countries in demanding the Security Council ""apply urgent and necessary measures to stop this invasion."" Israeli diplomats could not immediately be reached for comment. The embassy in Caracas was closed; and it was unclear how the Israeli government would respond. Jewish community leader Abraham Levy; president of the Venezuelan Confederation of Israelite Associations; called the government's decision ""taking the side of a terrorist group"" by backing Gaza's Hamas leaders while ignoring Israel's perspective. ""I deeply lament that decision made by the government; which cuts off an enormous and long tradition of friendship between the people of Israel and the people of Venezuela;"" Levy told The Associated Press. He said the decision leaves Venezuela's Jewish community &#8212; which numbers nearly 15;000 &#8212; ""not only worried but also deeply battered"" because it ""attempts to demonize the state of Israel."" While many countries have protested Israel's offensive; none besides Venezuela so far have expelled the ambassador. Mauritania; which established relations with Israel in 1999; called home its ambassador from the Jewish state on Monday. Jordan and Egypt; the other two Arab nations with relations with Israel; summoned their Israeli ambassadors to protest the Gaza attacks; but they have resisted popular calls to expel them. Chavez has long been critical of the Israeli government's policies in the Middle East and has supported the Palestinians' stance in the conflict. During Israel's 2006 conflict in Lebanon; Chavez withdrew his top envoy from Israel; calling the bombings there ""a new Holocaust."" Relations have remained at a scaled-back level since. Chavez's condemnations of Israel's offensive in Gaza have grown gradually more severe in recent days. On Monday he called the Jewish state a ""genocidal government;"" and on Tuesday urged Jews in Venezuela to take a stand against the Israeli government. In spite of harsh criticisms of Israel; Chavez's government has insisted it is friendly toward Jewish people. Chavez met with Jewish leaders in August; pledging to work against anti-Semitism despite strong differences on Mideast politics. Top Venezuelan officials explained Tuesday's decision speaking to cheering supporters at a Caracas mosque. Some in the crowd chanted ""Gaza; hold on. The people are rising up!"" Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said Venezuela declared the Israeli ambassador ""persona non grata"" and decided to ""reduce to a minimum the representation of this embassy in Venezuela."" Justice Minister Tarek El Aissami; who is of Arab descent; said ""our revolution is also a revolution for a free Palestine!"" Chavez accuses Israel of acting on behalf of the United States in the Mideast; and he has forged close ties with Israel's top enemies &#8212; Iran and Syria. Chavez also has used the tool of expelling an ambassador before. Last September; he kicked out U.S. envoy Patrick Duddy saying it was in solidarity with Bolivia; which also booted its U.S. ambassador; accusing him of aiding violent protests. Demonstrations against the offensive have been held in various Latin American countries in recent days. In Argentina; which has the third-largest Jewish population outside Israel; hundreds of people marched to the Israeli Embassy to call for an end to the offensive. Brazil's government; like Venezuela; has said it is sending food and medical aid to the Gaza Strip. And in Bolivia; about a hundred Palestinians and Arabs marched to protest the violence.",0

"Hello QL Memebers; I am neither new to Qatar nor new to QL. I have been living in Doha for over 10 years and been using QL as my 'search tool' for anything and everything about Doha :-) Just gathered that I have been a member for over a year; but never been active and hence thought of changing my status from inactive member to an active member. So; here is a big HELLO to all you guys out there.. hoping to meet some of you in the QL group activities. Happy QL-ing all of you! :-) Here's a thought for the day: ""Whenever I am tempted to want more material comfort or sense gratification; even though I know in my heart I have enough to get by; then I just think to myself - 'Whatever I have; it is sufficient; this is what's given; it's how much I get.

This is a good practice for cultivating gratitude; satisfaction and contentment - ultimate form of wealth!"" - Words of Lama Surya Das (Jeffrey Miller) in his book THE BIG QUESTIONS.",0

"Another Filipina worker killed in &#8216;OFW-friendly&#8217; Kuwait JERRIE M. ABELLA; GMANews.TV 10/24/2010 | 10:55 PM The Philippine Embassy in Kuwait has confirmed that the decomposing body of a woman found over a week ago on the roof of a building in that small; oil-rich Middle Eastern country was that of a Filipina worker. Vice Consul Rea Oreta said; in a phone interview Sunday with GMANews.TV; that the victim was identified based on her passport as Jenny Dechosa; 33; from Misamis Oriental. &#8220;(Kuwait&#8217;s) Criminal Investigation Division (CID) has just confirmed to us that the victim was indeed a Filipina; and her case is now under investigation;"" Oreta said. According to her; the CID likewise told the Embassy that an Egyptian national has been arrested in connection to the crime and is now detained at the Bayan Police Station. Oreta said the CID has refused to release more information on Dechosa&#8217;s case as it is considered &#8220;confidential;"" but reports state the suspect was the victim&#8217;s lover. &#8220;Right now we are requesting the help of the OUMWA (Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs) to locate the family of Dechosa because all we have is her passport;"" Oreta said. Missing since Oct. 10 A report by the Kuwait-based Arab Times said Dechosa&#8217;s body was found by police authorities on October 16 in between air-conditioning units on the roof of Hall No. 5 at the Kuwait International Fair grounds in Mishref. According to the report; Dechosa was working in a saloon in Salmiya and does part-time work as a house cleaner. Quoting Dechosa&#8217;s housemates; the report said the victim left their house on October 10; her rest day; for a part-time cleaning job in Mishref. She; however; reportedly backed out of the job as the house was too big and instead asked the taxi driver to drop her off a shopping mall where she was supposedly meeting someone. Dechosa was unable to go home that day; and six days after she was reported missing; a body of a woman in a state of decomposition was found in Mishref. On the same day; her employer and housemates confirmed that the body was indeed Dechosa&#8217;s through fingerprinting and other pieces of evidence; even as her face was reportedly unrecognizable as it seemed to have been smashed with a hard object; the Arab Times report said. A separate report on Arab Times on Saturday identified the suspect as the Egyptian caretaker of the building where Dechosa&#8217;s body was discovered. The report said the suspect was identified based on the victim&#8217;s mobile phone records. The suspect reportedly confessed he had an affair with Dechosa; and admitted killing her by hitting her with a metal rod on her head. The motive for the killing; however; remains unclear. According to Vice Consul Oreta; Dechosa&#8217;s remains may take at least a month to be repatriated; or as soon as the CID and the local prosecutor finish their investigation. OFW-friendly? The killing of Dechosa came three months after two other Filipinas were brutally killed in separate incidents in Kuwait; which has been identified by the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs as one of the countries where the rights and welfare of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) are protected. In July; a Filipina worker was tortured to death by her employer and then left in the desert; while another was stabbed dead at least 31 times by her Egyptian husband allegedly in a fit of jealousy. Government agencies have likewise repatriated Filipino workers from Kuwait by the hundreds in the last few months; majority of them household service workers who ran away from their sponsors for various reasons; such as labor contract violations and physical abuse; or are overstaying in the country. Oreta declined to comment if Kuwait&#8217;s classification as a safe country for migrant workers will be reviewed in light of the recent string of killings and abuses of Filipino laborers in the Middle East country. Kuwait ranks sixth in the top ten destinations of OFWs in 2009; with some 45;900 Filipino workers deployed there on the same year; according to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration. Records from the Commission on Filipinos Overseas meanwhile show there are over 140;000 Filipinos in Kuwait as of 2008; only 500 of whom are considered permanent residents. &#8211; DM/KBK; GMANews.TV",0

"This story is about a beautiful; expensively dressed lady who complained to her psychiatrist that she felt that her whole life was empty; it had no meaning. So; the lady went to visit a counselor to seek out happiness. The counselor called over the old lady who cleaned the office floors. The counselor then said to the rich lady""I'm going to ask Mary here to tell you how she found happiness. All I want you to do is listen to her."" So the old lady put down her broom and sat on a chair and told her story: ""Well; my husband died of malaria and three months later my only son was killed by a car. I had nobody... I had nothing left. I couldn't sleep; I couldn't eat;I never smiled at anyone; I even thought of taking my own life. Then one evening a little kitten followed me home from work. Somehow I felt sorry for that kitten. It was cold outside; so I decided to let the kitten in. I got it some milk; and the kitten licked the plate clean. Then it purred and rubbed against my leg and for the first time in months; I smiled. Then I stopped to think; if helping a little kitten could make me smile; maybe doing something for people could make me happy. So the next day I baked some biscuits and took them to a neighbor who was sick in bed. Every day I tried to do something nice for someone. It made me so happy to see them happy. Today; I don't know of anybody who sleeps and eats better than I do. I've found happiness; by giving it to others."" When she heard that the rich lady cried.

Can anyone give me advise please. I requested my company to arrange visit visa for my husband to join me for a month or two. yet; they said it is quite difficult and long process. Instead; they will issue Business Visa for him which they started the processing today. Since i heard a lot of unfortunate situations regarding the holding of passenger in NIA by POEA personnel; it makes me think twice. Should i take or just let this chance pass. Can anyone advise me what papers to prepare so I can relay it to my company. I should grab this one chance to let him come and join me here in Christmas season and our wedding anniversary before he will fly to NZ as he is also holding a visa that will expire mid January. Thanks in advance.,0

Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho denied that two of his players were deliberately sent off to ensure they will not be suspended for the Champions League knock-out stages. Sergio Ramos and Xabi Alonso both picked up second yellow cards for time-wasting in the late stages of the club's 4-0 win at Ajax. That means they will miss the last group G game against Auxerre; but the match is irrelevant as Real have already qualified as winners. European football's governing body Uefa said on Wednesday that its disciplinary unit are deciding whether Real have a case to answer. Source: BBC,0

Go to Bombay Chowpatty any day of the week (the one besides Family Food Centre on the airport road); anytime after 1830 hrs. and you will see cars parked on both sides of the road. Not only; do a lot of them order their snacks etc. from the comforts of their vehicle; they also expect the waiter to clear their tray/ plates etc. after they're done eating. I have watched this over a period of time and even checked with one of the waiting staff; when it come to paying up; unfortunately; majority of them don't tip the waiters and that is disturbing. Tipping is totally voluntary; there is no requirement to tip a waiter. Yet; assuming the service provided by the waiter is acceptable; especially in this heat and humidity; the least you can do is appreciate the guy coming to you car every so often and leave a decent tip. I do not want to talk about restaurants where you have your formal sit-down dinners; because some of the tips there go to the management and not the waiting staff. Some of the guys tending to you from smaller restaurants and grocery stores; IMHO; do deserve a gratuity in the form of a tip... :-),0

"Two-year-old Lillie; Jackson and Willsher Weekes were among the 13 children killed in the fire which broke out in the Villaggio Mall in Doha. The grandfather of the triplets killed in a blaze at a daycare centre in a Doha shopping mall says he struggles to see how he will ever be happy again. The fire ripped through the Gympanzee childcare centre in the Villaggio (correct) mall in the capital Doha at 11.30 am (8 pm NZT); killing 19 people and injuring 17. New Zealand-born triplets Lillie; Jackson and Willsher Weekes; aged two; were among those killed in the fire. They were the only children of expats Jane and Martin Weekes. The grandfather of the triplets; Ron Turner; told Newstalk ZB he and his wife would be travelling to Doha tonight to be with their daughter and son-in-law. They had been contacted by Ms Weekes just after the babies had been found and were told they had died of smoke inhalation. ""She was still just as numb I suppose; and just as empty as my wife and I feel right now and the rest of our family and friends who have rallied around to give us support. "" The triplets had been going to the day-care three mornings a week for the past couple of months; Mr Turner said. ""That gave them an opportunity to meet more children and be involved in a different environment than home and mum and dad and nannies; and they were so proud to show off their school bags.'' The triplets' bodies would be brought back to New Zealand; he said. Just last week Ms Weekes wrote on babycenter.com of potty training the trio. ""We have about 7 potties around our living space (it's a really big open plan area and is tiled so we have no issues with accidents) and in the bathroom to be able to sit one on the toilet with a kiddy seat and 1 or 2 on the potties if it turned into rush.'' New Zealand journalist Tarek Bazley; who lives 1km from the mall in Doha; was in another part of the mall with his children when the fire broke out. ""The first thing I heard of it was a very benign fire alarm; it sounded more like a doorbell to be honest; repeating in the background;'' he told Radio New Zealand. After 15 minutes he asked an attendant whether he should be worried; but was told to ""sit tight'' and that it was usually a false alarm. ""About 10 minutes later; someone else; a member of the public; raced through this area and said; `Everybody out; you've got to get out now. The other half of the mall is on fire.' That is what he said to me.'' ""I believe the problem was that once the fire took in the area near the nursery; there was no way to actually escape.'' Both exits were blocked by smoke; he said. The alarm and sprinkler system appeared to have malfunctioned. ""It's an extraordinary mall in the sense that as you walk down it it has this ceiling that is like a mock sky; so I think in order to achieve that effect; they've actually not put in sprinklers in this area.'' Fire-fighters had to break through the roof to get to trapped children after a staircase to the first-floor nursery collapsed; an official said. Dense smoke inside the mall; combined with the fierce temperature from the flames; made reaching the trapped children very difficult; a representative of the civil defence told a news conference. Prime Minister John Key this morning said New Zealand Foreign Affairs staff were travelling to Doha from Saudi Arabia to provide support for the Weekes' family. ""Their family are obviously dealing with the terrible grief that they have at this time. Obviously it's a very tragic day for that family.'' Labour leader David Shearer also sent his condolences to the family. ""I join with all other New Zealanders in expressing my heartfelt sympathies to the parents; extended family; and friends; of the three young children caught up in such a tragic event. The pain of their loss is unimaginable.",0

If you&#8217;re thinking of buying a new Kia car then think again! I have recently bought one in fact I have just taken it for its first (1000km) service. The car had a problem with the door handle and needed replacing. They said they had fixed it with lubrication but needless to say as soon as I inspected it; it was still the same! It took a stand up row with the supervisor at AL_ATTIYA Motors (Industrial area) to get him to order the part so that the door handle could be replaced (it still has not been replaced). ALSO...I left just under a &#188; tank of fuel in the car. When I picked the car up the following day; the fuel tank was TOTALLY empty with the display showing that I had 0 km to go before the tank was dry! There were no extra km on the odometer so the car must have been left &#8216;ticking over&#8217; for HOURS on end to exhaust the fuel. The car manual specifically says that the engine should not be left idling for longer than 3 minutes before 2000km!!! You would think that the &#8216;mechanics&#8217; would know this. I was worried about taking the car because I was concerned that I would run out of fuel....the supervisor seemed unconcerned and offered no explanation. Luckily my wife was with me in her car and we did make it to the nearest garage...which took us out of our way home!! IS THIS ACCEPTABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE?,0
"Dubai: A police lieutenant colonel; six lieutenants and six officers have been referred to court on charges of using torture and extensive beatings during an interrogation which allegedly led to the death of a Pakistani man and left two others with injuries. Prosecutors levelled a number of charges against the 13 Dubai Police personnel; varying from abuse of power; unlawful detention of the deceased B.K. and his two compatriots; torture; extensive use of force during interrogation; forgery and giving a false statement during official questioning by a public prosecutor. Dubai Police's forensic doctor testified that B.K. died after being badly beaten which left him with acute bleeding in his brain. B.K.'s injured compatriots were identified as S.H.; 38; and M.S.; 33. According to the forensic doctor's prosecution statement; M.S. sustained burns which were caused by a chemical substance used to remove rust. ""There were bruises; cuts and injuries over different parts of his body as well. Due to the severe and extensive beating; M.S. suffered a critical kidney failure. Meanwhile S.H. was beaten by hands and ghutras [head dress cord worn by local men] and kicked;"" the doctor claimed. The 13 suspects; including nine Emiratis; two Pakistanis and two Omanis; are scheduled to appear before the Dubai Court of First Instance on May 31. According to the charges sheet; prosecutors accused the brigadier; four lieutenants and four officers; with unlawfully locking up B.K. in Naif police station. Records said B.K.; M.S. and S.H. were allegedly wanted for an investigation related to a kidnapping case that caused death. Dubai Police Chief Lieutenant General Dahi Khalfan Tamim earlier told Gulf News that if the investigation uncovered negligence or culpability; those involved would have to face the law. An Eritrean ambulance paramedic testified that she and her colleagues were asked to head to Naif police station because there was a problem. ""We were not informed what happened. When we reached there; I saw B.K. on the floor. He had bruises on his body. He was already dead although we tried to resuscitate him and gave him five electric shocks&#8230; but it was too late.""",0

"THE boss of internet giant Google has warned about the dangers of putting too much personal information on the web. Eric Schmidt said kids who use social networking websites extensively may eventually have to change their names on reaching adulthood to escape their online pasts. He added that the hundreds of millions of web users worldwide who post personal information on the net may not be aware how dangerous it is. Mr Schmidt said: ""I don't believe society understands what happens when everything is available; knowable and recorded by everyone all the time."" Despite his concerns; he described social networking site Facebook as a ""company of consequence"". Google itself has a wealth of information on web users. It handles billions of emails through Gmail and has pictures of millions of people's houses on Google Street View. The web giant also has information on users based on their online searches. And Mr Schmidt believes the future of Google will rely on the company storing more and more personal information. He told Google's users: ""We know roughly who you are; roughly what you care about; roughly who your friends are."" Source: The Sun",0

"Wonder No. 1; ""It is all about geography"" Regardless of your education; qualifications; experience etc; the biggest determinate of your salary and professional status will be the place you came from; if you are from an Anglo speaking western country you guarantee a place at the top of the corporate ladder with all its benefits; while if you are from some where in Asia or Africa; then the bottom is your place; even if you are doing a much better job. Wonder No. 2; ""It is all about connections (wasta)"" Got all the right credentials; relevant experience; proper educational etc; but you don't know the right people; then you are in the wrong place and you better forget about getting that deserved position.

Wonder No. 3 ""The more you work; the less you get"" People who work in the ""best"" places such as governmental or semi governmental organizations work the least (by quantitative and qualitative measures) and earn the most; on the other side of the slide the unfortunate ones working in the ""worst"" private organizations; work very hardly and for endless hours and their earnings will barely make ends meet.

Wonder No. 5 ""Labor law"" No body seems to apply; understand; or even care about the labor law; again the ""best"" places such as governmental or semi governmental organizations create working conditions that can easily be envied by workers in Western Europe; while on the other side many of the private organizations apply their own custom made slavery laws we thought abolished in the 19th century.

Dear Friends; Greetings! Recently i was told at Indian Passport office at India is that spouse name must be endorsed in Parents Passports in order to obtain passport for infant. unfortunately my wife passport does not have spouse name endorsed. Hence the new passport application was rejected for my infant even though i have provided a sworn affidavit from Indian Embassy from Qatar. Now i have left with only option to endorse spouse name in my wife passport. However this will we be a reissue of new passport as per the rule. currently my family passport is having a Valid Qatar RP . Now what all i want to know is do i need to Transfer my Family Visa to Newly issued passport before arriving to Doha or it is not required as it can be done upon arrival to Doha. Please help me to clear the issue. Thanks. Uvaraj.,0
Hey; a strange experience folks. When ever you are travelling please check if your RP / Visa is valid at least for a period of 6 months. My RP expires on 16 Nov.2010; while the Immigration counter cleared with their seal; the guy Pravesh of Qatar Airways in the departure lounge never permitted me to board the flight at the last minute. I showed my return flight is within 48 hours; even if he wants me have a longer vacation;I cannot stay away; as I joined my employer 8 months back. I showed my EXIT permit and I am travelling to Muscat just for 2 days for a family commitment. As per GCC regulations the Visa is stamped for 2 years and RP renewed every year; I don't know how the Visa was also stamped for one year in my case. He took me to his Supervisor another Kid of 24; 25 years ; I mentioned I have lived in the GCC for 24 years and I would not jeopardise my job nor their job; but the guy went on blabbering 'I don't want to lose my job' again and again. I pity the plight of these youngsters; who would not understand practicality - while my stay in the airport for 2 hours such chaos and passengers speaking high tone and getting away for excess baggage and what not; I politely asked me to show me the counter for processing the refund and walked home with disappointment; afterall a week end trip to Muscat and back was futile. Please check the RP well before you plan your trip; just a caution so that you do not face the same disappointment; specially if it is a annual vacation. L.Balakrishnan,0
Two little boys are sitting in the living room watching TV with their parents. The mother looks over at the father with a wink and a nod towards upstairs. The mother turns back to the boys and says; &#8220;We&#8217;re going upstairs for a little while. You two stay here and watch TV. We&#8217;ll be right back. OK?&#8221; The two boys nod OK and the parents take off upstairs. The oldest of the two boys is old enough to know what&#8217;s going on now and he gets up and tiptoes upstairs. At the top of the stairs; he peeks into his mom and dad&#8217;s bedroom and shakes his head. Back downstairs he goes to his little brother. &#8220;Come with me;&#8221; he says. And the two little boys tiptoe up the stairs. Halfway up; the older brother turns to his younger brother and says; &#8220;Now I want you to keep in mind; this is the same woman who used to bust our a**es for sucking our thumbs!!&#8221;,0

"A man was sick and tired of goingto work every day while his wife stayed home. He wanted her to see what he went through so he prayed: ""Dear Lord: I go to work every day and put in 8 hours while my wife merely stays at home. I want her to know what I go through; so please allow her body to switch with mine for a day. Amen. God; in his infinite wisdom; granted the man'swish. The next morning; sure enough; the man awoke as a woman. He arose; cooked breakfast forhis mate; awakened the kids; Set out their school clothes; fed them breakfast; packed their lunches; Drove them to school; came home andpicked up the dry cleaning; took it to the cleaners And stopped at the bank to make a deposit; went grocery shopping; Then drove home to put away the groceries; Paid the bills and balanced the checkbook. He cleaned the cat's litter box andbathed the dog. Then it was already 1 P.M.and he hurried to make the beds;do the laundry; vacuum; dust; and sweep and mop the kitchen floor. Ran to the school to pick up the kids and got into an argument with them on the way home. Set out milk and cookies and got the kids organized to do their homework; Then set up the ironing board and watched TV while he did the ironing. At 4:30 he began peelingpotatoes and washing vegetables for salad; breaded the pork chops and snapped fresh beans for supper. After supper; he cleaned the kitchen; ran the dishwasher; folded laundry; bathed the kids; and put them to bed. At 9 P.M. he was exhausted and; though his daily chores weren'tfinished; he went to bed where he was expected to make love; which he managed to get through without complaint. The next morning; he awoke and immediately knelt by the bed and said; Lord; I don't know what I was thinking. Iwas so wrong to envy my wife's being able to stay home all day. Please; oh please; let us trade back."" The Lord; in his infinite wisdom; replied; ""My son; I feel you have learned your lesson and I will be happy to change things back to the way they were. You'll just have to wait nine months;though. You got pregnant last night.""",0

"ABU DHABI -- The Ministry of Interior yesterday withdrew the ""six-month ban"" system imposed by the Immigration and Residency authorities on various categories of workers upon the cancellation of expatriates' employment visa. The decision; that will have a major impact and implications on the UAE labour market; has come into force with immediate effect. The Naturalisation and Residency Departments stopped stamping the ban on passports while processing cancellation of employment visas. Ahmed Al Hamadi; in-charge of Passport Office at the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs; said: ""We received a letter from the Immigration and Residency Department with instructions from Interior Minister Lt-Gen. Shaikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan not to stamp the ban on applications for cancelling visas. The decision was put into effect yesterday when we cancelled employment visas without imposing the ban."" He said the office received hundreds of applications yesterday; which were processed without slapping the six-month ban. For employers; it will now be easier to hire talents from within the country. For the millions of expats working in various capacities; barring maids; the news should come as manna from heaven; for there would now be free movement of workforce in the country. Employers can get the best talent available in the market without the hassle of seeking the ""No Objection Certificate"" from the current sponsor. Ministry sources told Khaleej Times that under instructions from Lt.-Gen. Shaikh Saif; the ministry circulated the decree among all Immigration and Residency Departments in the country; and that the decision came into effect yesterday. On the categories included in the decree; the official said only housemaids were excluded for the time being; and that a special committee would be set up to study their case. ""Housemaids were not included in the decision. A special panel will be formed to study the possibilities of exempting this category also from the ban;"" said the official. He said the decision was in line with Cabinet Decree No. 18 of 2005 on sponsorship transfer of employees in the private sector; under which a fee of Dh1;500 for masters and doctorate holders; Dh3;000 for bachelors degree holders and Dh5;000 for certificates lower than bachelors degree would be levied. A special panel comprising senior officials had been set up in February to look into various aspects of streamlining the residence and labour market laws. Hitherto; only those who met the requisite conditions for sponsorship transfer; including consent of sponsor; completion of one-year in a company and a valid residence visa; among others; were eligible to change jobs within the country without getting their passports stamped with the six-month ban. In practice; however; movement of labour force was virtually impossible with hardly any sponsor willing to write out a no objection certificate. Meanwhile; most employees and employers who were processing their applications at the ministry yesterday; seemed overwhelmed by the decision and welcomed the measure which they said was bound to improve labour relations. Ahmed Ibrahim; an investor; said: ""the decision is excellent. It will spare employees the hassles they face with employers.""Abdul Jalil Rahma; owner of Noon Contracting and Construction Company; said : ""The ban was never in favour of employees. Scrapping the ban will free employees of the threat posed by some employers; leading to relinquishment of their entitlements in favour of release."" While most of the GCC countries trying their best to reduce the hassles of employees; here in Doha; some were requested to increase the re-entry ban to 5 years. The sponsorship system and re-entry ban are always making the employees in Doha more depressed. Still wonder we are in the modern world with consider human values; their freedom.....",0

"Is the world going crazy or I am not up with the times ? Europe's top court has declared that working fathers in Spain are entitled to take 'breastfeeding leave' everyday; even if the mother of the child is not employed. The Court ruled that the law caused an 'unjustified discrimination on grounds of sex' because fathers do not have the same rights as mothers The new legislation means that both the mother and father are allowed to leave work for an hour during the day or reduce their working day by half an hour during the first nine months following the birth of a child. The European Union Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled on Thursday that the Spanish law caused an ""unjustified discrimination on grounds of sex"" because fathers do not have the same rights as mothers. Breastfeeding leave should now be considered as ""time purely devoted to the child"" in order to reconcile family life and work after maternity leave. Source: Telegraph",0

"Is this bad taste or just a contest where the winner actually WINS ! A New Zealand radio station has been criticised for running a contest giving male listeners the chance to win a wife. The winner of The Rock FM's competition will be flown to Ukraine for 12 nights to pick their future wife from a bride agency. ""If you're interested in holy matrimony with a potentially hot foreign chick; fill it out to the best of your abilities."" Not to be put off by the complaints; numerous men have entered the competition and appear happy to have their profiles shown on the radio's website. Defending the station; The Rock FM program director; Brad King; said the competition was ""a bit of a laugh"". ""At the end of the day; it's up to both people if they decide to get married and return to New Zealand. We're not actually marrying anyone or bringing women back to New Zealand;"" he said. However; social activist Sue Bradford said the competition took ""commercial radio to new depths"". ""It is unusual and somewhat disturbing that a commercial entity would commercialise what should be one of the most meaningful human relationships and actually offer it as a prize for a radio show;"" she said.",0

So yesterday I was with my family at Doha City. I decided to stay back in the car and read while my parents went inside to shop. An hour later; I heard someone tapping on the window. I looked up to see a man; of South Asian descent tapping on my window. 'Salam Aleikum;' he said when I looked up. I lowered the window and asked him what he wanted. Realizing I was Indian; he started speaking in Urdu and narrated a extremely pitiful story of how his hand was fractured and he had no money to treat it. He asked me for some cash. I told him I hadn't any after which he began begging again and said he wanted to go back to his home country. I didn't see the relation between his swollen hand and his desire to go back to his home; but the sight of the hand was disturbing. I relented and gave him five riyals. He looked at it and walked away without a word of Thanks. He then intercepted two Caucasian women walking to their car right behind mine. I lowered the window and watched. He narrated the same story. They listened; ignored him and drove away. A few minutes later; my Father stepped out of the store. I told him about the incident. He immediately understood and told me I should not have paid him. He told me about an incident near the Family Food Center at Bombay Chowpatty where he met someone similar who showed him a 'plastic bag that ran to his kidney' and begged him for money. Out of pity; when my dad gave him QR 50 he said it was 'not enough'. A waiter at Bombay Chowpatty then warned him against that there was a gang of panhandlers; most of whom are from the Indian subcontinent; who fake medical conditions to solicit money primarily from expats. I then spied him and pointed him out at which point he began to run away. Please do not indulge these people's requests if you encounter them. The Qatari police are supposedly on the lookout. They seem to congregate at expat heavy areas in Doha.,0

"From Ifancy To Adulthood: From the moment we are born we are barraged by manipulation; conditioning; and pressure to become the image of what is around us. As kid's we're led to believe that we must conform to what society tells us and basically give in to the norms laid out to us. It's easy to see; just take a look at the relationship between the current fad and children or teens. The only reason it is popular is because it is presented to kids constantly through the various media outlets (radio; commercials; magazines; etc.) which imbeds the idea that it is ""cool"" or ""hip"" in our brains. It's simple psychology that if you show someone who isn't consciously aware of what is going on something enough times they will begin to form somewhat of a bond with the object or item. The popularity of music is a prime example; sales and popularity are not one bit based on artistry or talent they are purely based on who gets the most exposure; or in better terms who gets marketed best and who has the biggest budget. Hip Hop artist Joe Budden put it in layman's terms in the song Microphone when he said in one line; ""fuck record sales or who the machine markets best;"" it couldn't be more true. The reason that this is important and has major significance is because it proves that we are easily controllable and that we can be directed towards the goals of those in control.",0
Please find below a letter to Gulf Times Editor written br Mr. Abdul Nasar A. K. and published in today's GT For your comments. _________________________________________________________ LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Winter agony for KG kids Dear Sir; It is heart-rending for parents to awake their KG-going children early in the morning; around 5 o&#8217;clock; for school every day in winter. Every morning I feel extremely guilty when I force my four-year-old daughter to get up at that time so that she can go to school. If our children are genuinely conscious of their rights they would file a lawsuit against their parents to protect them from this type of &#8220;abuse&#8221;! It is a type of torture and cruelty even though our actions are inspired by good intentions and the future well-being of our kids itself. But good intentions cannot always justify actions. Nevertheless; my suggestion to expatriate school managements is to consider changing timing for KG pupils from January to March at least. Classes for the above category now start at the same time as for senior grades and end by 11am. Special buses then take the kids back home. It will not be an additional burden for school managements if they deploy these buses to collect KG students from their houses by 9am and start their classes by 10am. KG classes could end by 1pm as with senior pupils and they can all return home in one bus. I would like to request all parents to come forward with their suggestions. School authorities also can make a survey to know how parents think about this suggestion; if they see it worth considering. Abdul Nasar A K aknaser@yahoo.co.uk,0

Any contact with number will be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance. Cheers,0

If Rapunzel never let down her golden hair; the prince couldn&#8217;t have climbed up the tower. She would have been an old virgin spinster with dying eggs. To live happily ever after involves great risks because in these times we just can&#8217;t sit on our asses and expect our white knight on his horse to fall down from the sky. We have to open ourselves to possibilities and get out of our comfort zones in order to meet people. We just can&#8217;t sleep for a hundred years and expect to be kissed by a prince; unless; of course; if he&#8217;s a comatose patient molester in the case of Sleeping Beauty or a necrophile prince in Snow White&#8217;s. We have to let go of our traumatic experiences with the Pinocchios we dated; our ugly duckling issues and inhibitions. Spread our wings like a swan; go to the ball; leave our glass slippers and hope for the best he&#8217;d call. We are our own fairytale godmothers. We can make things happen for ourselves. And if an evil stepmother or a wicked witch stands in the way; well; just lift up those pretty white gowns and; well; kick the BITCH&#8217;s ASS! For all Modern women out there...,0
First of all I would like to congratulate all BPL fans for another Great year of Football. It been a pleasure for us to support and to watch our team Games. And I have to say; congratulation to Manchester United for winning a record 19th league championship. I am sure that next season will be more exciting for everybody and I wish to my team (Pride of London) to rest well during the summer and to comeback stronger next season. Today is the Final whistle for BPL Games 2011 and make sure you be a witness. .....................LET THE GAME START...................,0

Some of you may recall a post about two days ago from a family with seven children asking for food/assistance. Many people were quite suspicious (which is reasonable considering the possibility of fraud) while others were quite condescending (which was not so nice in the Month of Mercy). An update: I have met this family and their case seems quite genuine. They are happy to accept any kind of assistance including groceries. I am reprinting her previously published e-mail address if anyone is interesting in helping them out: umieshah /at/ yahoo.com.,0

Hi folks; I am moving to Qatar in 10 days. My employer (Barwa) just asked me to bring a UK police clearance with a stamp from the ministry of foreign affairs. I assume this is to show proof that there are no legal or criminal convictions against me. I've just been to my local police station who say they won't provide this kind of information. They gave me the contact details for Disclosure Scotland; a govt department; who process these disclosures. Unfortunately this takes about 40 days end to end and I only have 10... Presumably you guys have been through this. Can anyone give me advice one what you did or whether there's a quicker way to get this resolved. Also if I just arrive in Doha; do I need a formal tourist visa for the first month until my work visa is processed; or can I just get one when I arrive at Doha? Many thanks for your advice.,0

How and were to apply a visit visa to my wife and whats are the requirements?,0
I have applied for a family visa for my wife and kids. By the mean time; I planned to get a visit visa and bring them early (I am bored to death being alone in a 2 bedroom flat). But; when I checked about this idea; people say that it is mandatory to book return tickets for people entering Qatar in visit visa.I can cancel the ticket later but;&#160;they have to have a return trip ticket!!! Although it makes sense in a way; Just wanted to confirm whether it is true and are there any workarounds. Thanks folks,0

Good afternoon all; I have resigned from Qatar Airways and will be heading back to the UK; due to a family tragedy. I have enjoyed my time at QA; but must complain about how long the process is to leave this country. They make you jump through hoops; and have no compassion towards you. I hope that when a family tragedy happens to any body else; that they treat with the compassion that you need; and not the negativity i have recieved here. Good bye and good luck to all....,0
Last time;I heard that in order to get a husband visa; your salary should be QAR 5;000.00 monthly. Did they change the policy or is it still the same?,0
I have been working in Qatar since August 2011 and have completed my 2 years contract with my employer. It is not just the workers in construction side but also management level professionals been treated like slaves. And the worst part is that we (Immigrants) can't take any action against the employers here. I was working with a local employer in the hospitality section as IT Manager. I was promised that I will get release/NOC after completing my two years contract with the company. I did completed my contract and found another opportunity with a high package and family benefits. I have two kids; one 11 months old and the other two and half year old; for me the important thing was to look for something that could help me to get the best health and living facilities for my kids; which was offered by the new company. I gave a notice period of 40 days to my company with a written request to get NOC to work in Qatar and my management confirmed in writing that I shall be getting my NOC. The time I completed my 40 days&#8217; notice with a proper handover; the company refused to give me NOC and thus I became jobless. Because I left the company and I cannot join another one; I have nothing to survive. I have bank liabilities taken for my family support; now the bank is asking me to clear the liabilities which I cannot because my ex. employer hasn&#8217;t paid my end of services and still holding my passport and I have no work even to feed my kids so how can I pay the bank. Bank is not allowing me to go out of the country because of the liabilities and my ex. company is not giving me release to work anywhere else in Qatar. If I couldn't pay the bank they can put me in jail that makes me worry because I don&#8217;t know what will happen to my kids. I tried to go the human rights commission here in Qatar but I was strictly informed not to file any complaint or case against the local employer as they will put me and my family in more troubles. I don&#8217;t know what to do. And I don&#8217;t know who I should ask to get help. I have been cheated badly by my ex employer and I can't do anything.,0

"Asians in particular spend billions on after school tutoring and cram schools for kids. Now South Korea is trying to clamp down. The government says that it not only burdens the child but focuses on "" raising test scores; not nurturing creativity or any other aspect of human nature"" Additionaly; tutoring/cram schools and parental pressure are being blamed for a high suicide rate and a plummeting birth rate; as prospective parents weigh the costs of educating children. So; what say you. Are we putting too much pressure and expecting too much of our children ?",0

"How can we allow this to go on ? Help stop it NOW! Millions of male chicks are killed every year by the egg industry; according to new undercover footage from animal campaigners; that shows the tiny birds on a ""conveyor belt to death"". The birds are dropped onto a conveyor belt where they are sorted by sex. The males are apparently either thrown alive into electronic mincers or instantly gassed to death. The females are kept for laying; but only after they have been placed in a machine that clips off the end of their beaks and jabs them against disease. Viva! visited two hatcheries in Preston. At Tom Barron hatchery they claimed the male chicks were gassed in a giant machine and their bodies packaged to be fed to reptiles. At Fresh Farm Hatchery they claim the birds are thrown directly into a mincer and used for fertiliser. The birds are sorted for sex according to colour. In the gassing method whole crates of males are put in a chamber and then packaged once they are dead. The mincing or &#8216;instantaneous mechanical destruction&#8217; is usually a quicker route to death and is widely used in the US. Both methods are legal and approved by both the Humane Slaughter Association and the RSPCA. Source: Telegraph",0

I got my work visa today and noticed that it is only valid for 3 months. To verify what type of visa was issued since it was written in Arabic; I logged on the website of the Ministry of Interior. I found out that it is a work visit visa single entry. Can anybody explain to me the difference of a work visa from a work visit visa and work permit and also a residence visa and a residence permit. What will my employer issue to me upon the expiration of my work visit visa while I am in Qatar? Thanks.,0
