But I also noticed that many people around the world are dying from this disease . What do you think he is doing that the other people worldwide are not ? That 's hard to say . It may be that he has HIV but has n't been infected with it . I know that is possible . Also , since he is wealthy and well-known , he likely has more access to drug therapies that may help him hold off the infection 's progress.As a world-class athlete ( at least then ) , his body may be able to better withstand the effects . Or he 's just unbelievably lucky . Take your pick .",1
"What is Trans Fat ? How to reduce that ? I heard that tras fat is bad for the body . Why is that ? Where can we find it in our daily food ? Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation , when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil . The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat , which raises `` bad '' LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease . Until very recently , food labels were not required to list trans fats , and this health risk remained hidden to consumers . In early July , FDA regulations changed , and food labels will soon begin identifying trans fat content in processed foods .",1

"do smoking make you lose muscle ? I have not heard of muscle loss because of smoking . I had a close friend who smoked a lot and now has a mouth full of dentures .

Collagen gets reduced because of age , but smoking seems to really hurt collagen in some people .",1

"what do you do for excessive mucus production ? I have excessive mucus production . I have two sinus surgerys , but the mucus was there befor the surgerys . It is so bad that it comes from my gums . I have a bad cough , it always produces a mouth full of mucus . It pockets in the back of my throat . It has gotten so bad that it disrupts my sleep . I take a cloth to bed each night to clean my mouth . If any one has ever had this problem , please let me know what you did for relife . I have spent a small fortune on doctors and medicine . As of now , no help . Thank you . I had the same problem , I could n't breathe through my nose because , my nose and mouth were constantly full of mucus and I was constantly spitting out this gunk . Sometimes , I would be choking and gagging in my sleep . A relative sent me a print-out of the side effects of the medication I was taking . It included breathing problems , mucus buildup , nodules ( which I now have exactly where my sinuses are ) and a lot of other dangerous side effects . I went off the med . and while I still have some mucus production it is no where near what it used to be . My doctor tried to get me to go back on the same med . even after I told him about the mucus problems it caused . He said it did n't do that . When I insisted that it did , he looked it up on his computer and then said `` if that happens again , you can always go off it '' . Needless to say , I refused to take it . Also , on one exam , the nurse told me I had polyps in my nose . She told me to see an ENT and have them removed ( surgically ) . I am glad I did n't . I just saw an M.D . on tv who said that when polyps in your nose are removed , they usually will come back . He said a safe non-surgical way to get rid of them is to use Nasonex twice a day and it is safe to do that . I think I 'll take his advice and try it . I do n't know why some doctors first advice is surgery especially if there is a non-surgical way to remedy a problem . I hope you find a solution to your problems .",1

"what are treadmills good for working out ? what do they tone up ? They 're good for your lower torso and your legs . That 's pretty much it . If you want a good OVERALL body workout , you 're going to have to incorporate your arms into the motion on the treadmill - light weights would work , or if it 's a NordicTrack - those work GREAT ! Of course , I 'm a bit biased , because I used to work at NordicTrack ... but I have to admit , I worked OUT when I worked there ; and I DID see improvement in my entire body . Thing is , most treadmills , you use your legs only . If you really want a great workout , and to really tone up your muscles ( meaning to lose baby fat , get ripped , no spare tire , no water retention , etc. , etc ... . ) you need an overall cardiovascular workout . While a treadmill is good for that , you should consider a workout that encompasses the entire body for that will tone you up so much faster than if you did it halfway.Besides ... when those exercise videos say they can help you tone up your abs , or build up a certain body part ... DO N'T fall for it ! ! It does n't work THAT way ! In order to lose weight from a CERTAIN area of your body , you have to lose it EVERYWHERE on your body !

"How do I know if my childs imagination is too extensive ? She is 3yrs old and has several imaginary friends , insists we feed her dolls our food at meals , and she is constantly making up stories about when she was older or a baby . I 'm beginning to think she 's losing touch with reality . While having an active imagination is no crime and certainly should n't alarm you as a parent , you might consider what these friends provide for your daughter . It seems like she has experienced some instability in life right now and if she is feeling detached from her father , then she may be concerned that you , her mother might also unexpectedly leave or disappear . She is only 3 and is limited on her ability to communicate and understand these abandoning feelings and may have created an abundance of imaginary friends because she knows she can count on them not leaving . She may not be able to say , `` Mommy , are you going to leave too ? '' But she can create a fantasy of dolls and imaginary friends that support and validate her feelings . So while I would n't say that you should seek clinical therapy for your 3 year old , I would suggest that a sincere heart to heart with your daughter , and some invested mommy time , you could really help your daughter reconnect to the real supports in her life , you ! Suggestion : Find a way to validate her feelings . Having a drawing party ! Allow her to draw , and invite her imaginary friends to draw also . Sit at a table that is age appropriate for her ( or sit on the floor ) and allow her to describe to you the drawings of all the friends , as well as her own drawing . You might suggest to her drawing a few pictures . Maybe one of `` our new house '' . Have another drawing of `` our family '' , and her school/friends , room or house . You will learn a lot from her and it will allow her practice in expressing her feelings to you , her mom , rather than dolls and friends . Find age appropriate ways of bonding with your daughter . I would love to hear what you try and how it turns out ! Good Luck ! emailjacquisoon @ yahoo.com",1

"how to treat diarrhea in a toddler. ? While rarely serious when treated properly , diarrhea can send your toddler to the hospital if he becomes dehydrated , so your first concern should be giving him enough liquids . If your toddler is n't also vomiting , it should be fairly easy to give him extra water to drink . If he ca n't keep liquids down , though , or if his diarrhea is severe ( a watery bowel movement every two hours or more ) , call his doctor , who may suggest a pediatric electrolyte solution , like Pedialyte , ReVital , or a generic brand . These solutions are available in drugstores and come in flavors that most toddlers will readily drink if they 're dehydrated.Avoid sweetened fluids like sodas ( including ginger ale ) , athletic drinks ( like Gatorade ) , Jell-O , sugar water , and undiluted fruit juices . All of these contain sugar that will draw water into the intestine and make the diarrhea worse . Also do n't use anti-diarrhea medication unless the doctor prescribes it.Doctors now advise continuing to feed solid foods to a child with diarrhea . While there 's nothing wrong with feeding your toddler the classic BRAT diet ( bananas , rice , applesauce , and dry toast ) , the AAP says any foods made up of complex carbohydrates , such as rice , wheat , potatoes , bread , and cereal , as well as lean meats , yogurt , fruits , and vegetables , are safe to eat . ( If your toddler temporarily refuses to eat , do n't worry . As long as he stays hydrated his appetite should return in a day or two . ) Studies have shown that live bacterial cultures , found in yogurt , are a safe and effective way to cut down on the amount and duration of diarrhea . It 's an easy way to treat the problem , especially if your toddler loves the taste of yogurt . Just be sure to buy yogurt with lactobacillus , or live cultures.If your toddler is uncomfortable during a bout of diarrhea , try to cuddle and comfort him as much as possible and keep his bottom dry . Use care , tenderness , and plenty of diaper cream when changing him , since it 's easy for your toddler 's bottom to become red and irritated from the loose stools .",1

Has anyone underwent Laser eye surgery ? What are the risks and the cost incurred ? Does it work for all types of vision problem ? Does it need any kind of maintenance ? I had laser vision surgery a few years ago in one of my eyes . I did n't get it done in the other because I wanted to be able to read without glasses with one eye and see in the distance with the other without glasses . It worked out well for me this way and I never need glasses ( except sunglasses ) . I have n't need any kind of maintenance after the 1st couple of visits . Locally it costs about $ 500 per eye but it probably will be different by where you live . You will have to ask an eye doctor about your other questions but keep in mind you only have to get one eye done if you still want to be able to read without glasses . Good luck .,1

"Why is alcohol legal ? In the UK the number of alcohol related deaths soars past 20 , 000 per year , and in the USA , the figure is more than double that . It was once illegal in the US , during a period known as prohibition . However , while alcohol use dipped initially , prohibition 's negative effects outweighed the positive ones . One problem is that despite the fact that alcohol was illegal , it was easy to make and import alcohol from outside the US . As well , prohibition did a great deal to contribute to organized crime , which profited of sales of alcohol . Since alcohol consumption was and is still well established in American and British culture , the demand is such that underground organizations would thrive . As such , we would see an increase in crime and probably not a tremendous fall in alcohol-related crime.To add to that , the alcohol-making industry has much more resources than the prohibitionist movement and thus prohibition is also less politically viable for financial reasons.For more info on prohibition , check out the Wikipedia article below .",1

Children need to understand that what is wrong with their parents is not their fault and they are not responsible for their parents .

The trick is to put them in a group situation with other children going through the same thing that they are . The priority though is to always be honest with the child .

Drink a glass of water just before eating the dinner , this will help you not to want to go for seconds , and using a small plate also will help . Drink 7 glasses of water all through out the day . One more thing do not eat anything three hours before going to sleep only water if the urge comes up.Keep doing this for a week , you will loose weight in a healthy way , and this will help you keep it off as well because you are eating everything you want to eat and you do not have the feeling of hunger or thirst .

"I 'm 30 and I just found out that I have high cholesterol . Before I never cared about what I eat but know I .. I would like to find out more about how to read the Nutrition Facts on food , and how to decide which is a better choice . I know that the Cholesterol level and Saturated fat level is important . I 'm wondering if the Sodium has anything to do with Cholesterol.I also would like to know more about specific foods that are good to control and lover Cholesterol level ( like fish , chicken etc.. and how much I could eat of these healtier ones . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Soluble fiber is very good at lowering cholesterol as it binds the bile ( a digestive agent ) & causes you to excrete it . The body makes more bile ( to replace that which was lost - if it was n't lost , the body tends to recycle bile ) from cholesterol . You 'll find soluble fiber in foods such as apples , oranges & oatmeal . Insoluble fiber is also good for your heart , so eat high fiber foods like beans & veggies . Sodium does not affect your cholesterol level , but it can affect heart health so it 's best to keep it to a minimum . A little exercize , such as walking for 30 minutes 3 times a week , will also work wonders .

"What are the odds of a man catching HIV while having unprotected sex ( oral and vaginally ) ? What are the odds of a man catching HIV while having unprotected sex ( oral and vaginally ) with a woman who is HIV positive or AIDS . How do those odds change over time ? In other words , one sexual encounter versus multiple ? The following numbers are old , and they 're all pretty much guesswork anyway , so take them with a grain of salt . But I venture to say most people in the field would agree with my conclusions.According to a report by researchers Norman Hearst and Stephen Hulley in the Journal of the American Medical Association , the odds of a heterosexual becoming infected with AIDS after one episode of penile-vaginal intercourse with someone in a non-high-risk group without a condom are one in 5 million . With a condom it 's even safer -- one in 50 million . Just to put this in perspective , the chances of someone in your family getting injured next year in a bubble bath are 1 in 1.3 million ( source : The Odds on Virtually Everything , Heron House , 1980 ) . You 're in much greater danger of being struck by lightning ( 1 in 600,000 ) , having your house bombed ( 1 in 290,000 ) , or being murdered ( 1 in 11,000 ) .The numbers get a lot worse if you engage in `` high-risk behavior '' -- having sexual intercourse or sharing needles with a member of a high-risk group , e.g. , a gay or bisexual male or IV drug user from a major metro area , or a hemophiliac . The chances of getting AIDS from one such encounter range as high as 1 in 10,000 using a condom to 1 in 1,000 unprotected . Even if your partner tests negative for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , the chances of infection from a high-risk person are still relatively high -- 1 in 50,000 without a condom . That 's because there 's a 45 to 90 day window during which a newly infected person can infect others but test negative . ( A few people go as long as 180 days . ) From there on out , statistically speaking , things deteriorate pretty fast . If your partner is HIV-positive , your chances of getting AIDS after one night are 1 in 5,000 with a condom , 1 in 500 without . Have sex with an HIV-positive partner 500 times using condoms and your chances escalate to 1 in 11 . Skip the gift wrap and they 're 2 in 3.A couple points : These odds apply equally to men and women . Although there 's reason to believe male-to-female AIDS transmission happens more often than female-to-male , the amount of difference is unknown . Also , I have to emphasize again , the numbers involve a lot of guesswork . The authors admit they could be off by a factor of ten in either direction . Still , one message comes through loud and clear : by far the best thing you can do to avoid AIDS is to be picky about your partners . Use of condoms reduces your risk by a factor of 10 , sleeping only with people who test negative reduces it by a factor of 5 to 50 , but avoiding high-risk partners reduces it by a factor of 5,000 . ( You 'd also be well advised to avoid high-risk behavior , such as unprotected receptive anal sex . ) Asking for a resume may not be romantic , but it beats Kaposi 's sarcoma .",1
"What is a good start for a man over 40 , weight traning and cardio plan ? I am in fairly good shape . Matt , I would recommend that you start with a check-up with your doctor , just to make sure you are in otherwise good shape . Having done this you are good to go . Although not widely known , weight lifters normally have better cardio systems than runners , just not the lung capacity . At 40 , I would recommend starting with a moderate weight lifting routine on machines . Later you can switch to free weights as you get stronger . Free weights are better in some respect in that you have to control the weights . However , most modern machine weights are designed to give you a workout throughout the complete range of motion . Make sure you get plenty of rest between reps and do n't over do it to start with . Also add moderate stretching and decent nutrition . You do n't have to give up all good foods , because as you add muscle your body will consume more calories , even at rest . Sometimes the muscle aches caused by the minor tears in the muscle during working out do n't appear for 48 hours . The tears rebuild and realign into stronger muscle tissue . Take your time . Normally about 3 weeks of moderate weight lifting will begin to show results . A little weight gain can be expected if you are n't also dieting , but the weight gain does not mean size gain . Muscle is denser , so a pound of muscle is not as big as a pound of fat . Good luck ole boy and welcome to the over 40 club . By the way . Since I turned 40 I have dated women ranging in age from 19 to 56 , so if you are n't married , it 's a whole new world out there .",1

"I ve a very severe short sightedness which affects just an eye and doctors say glasses wo n't help . pls advice The doctor says the use of a glasses is out of the question since just one eye is affected and a thick lens according 2 him will affect d other eye and moreso i will ve a multiple vision Well , I do n't know the specifics of your problem , but I can offer a bit of an explanation of what your doctor said . Glasses would n't help you because the lenses for each eye would be dramatically different . Since you 're very near-sighted in the one eye , you would need a very strong lens that would ultimately make the image on your retina much smaller than the image on your other retina . If these two images are very different sizes , your brain ca n't put them together into one image and you see double . If both of your eyes can be corrected to 20/20 vision , I would ask your doctor ( or another doctor , if you 'd like a second opinion ) if LASIK is an option for you . This could possibly bring your very near-sighted eye close enough to the other eye so that your brain would be able to make a single image .",1

"can i have a child if i have crohns and what are the risk ? can i have achid if I have crohns and what are the risk ? Most women with Crohn 's disease are able to deliver healthy , full-term babies ; however , many people have questions about the impact Crohn 's disease will have on a pregnancy . Women who have Crohn 's disease may be concerned about whether or not they have the physical capacity to carry a pregnancy to term , while men with Crohn 's disease may worry whether medication has affected the viability of their sperm.Will we be able to conceive a baby ? Women with an active case of Crohn 's disease may have difficulty conceiving . Men who use sulfasalazine , a commonly used drug to treat Crohn 's disease , may become temporarily infertile because the sulfa compound can decrease sperm production . If a man is trying to father a child , he should ask his physician about 5-ASA medications which can treat Crohn 's disease without risking fertility . Women with Crohn ’ s disease who are planning to become pregnant should consult a doctor.How can Crohn 's disease affect my pregnancy ? While most women with Crohn 's disease are able to carry a full-term pregnancy and deliver a healthy baby , it is important for you to know that your disease may affect your pregnancy in the following ways : A cesarean section may be required for some women who have Crohn 's disease with complications , including abscesses or fistulas of the rectum or vagina.If a woman is experiencing an active bout of Crohn 's disease during pregnancy she has a 2 to 3 times increased risk of miscarriage , delivering the baby prematurely , or stillbirth.If a woman has active Crohn 's disease at the time of conception , the disease usually runs its course in a similar way to the pattern that was experienced before pregnancy.If a woman is experiencing active Crohn 's disease prior to a pregnancy , she may notice that the symptoms of her disease worsen right after becoming pregnant and during the first 3 months of the pregnancy . The disease may also intensify right after the delivery of her baby . It 's important to remember that every pregnancy is different . There is no evidence showing that if you experience severe symptoms during your pregnancy , subsequent pregnancies will also be difficult.Should I change my diet now that I am pregnant ? It is important for all pregnant women to eat a healthy and well-balanced diet . As a woman with Crohn 's disease , in addition to eating a standard diet recommended during pregnancy , your obstetrician and gastroenterologist may also recommend some special foods , vitamins , and minerals . If your Crohn 's disease is being treated with sulfasalazine , it is important that your diet be supplemented with folic acid , since this is an essential nutrient in preventing certain birth defects.Are medications for Crohn 's disease safe to take during my pregnancy ? All women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant should avoid taking any unnecessary medications . However , if you are experiencing active Crohn 's disease , it may be necessary for you to be treated with medication.If you ’ re a pregnant woman and considering drug therapy , you should speak with both your gastroenterologist and your obstetrician , so that each healthcare provider is well informed about current health issues when recommending treatment options.Are any diagnostic tests safe during pregnancy ? All pregnant women should avoid having X-rays , especially during the first 12 weeks , unless it is absolutely necessary . Presently , MRIs are sometimes used , but more information is needed . The following tests may also be used for pregnant women who may have Crohn 's disease for the management of their disease : Abdominal ultrasoundSigmoidoscopyRectal biopsyUpper endoscopyColonoscopyWill previous surgery for Crohn 's disease affect my pregnancy ?

They do sell those that do n't have to be stored that way , but all the information i 've read suggests that they do n't really work the same as most of the bacteria are dead by the time you take them . The enteric coating prevents the bacteria in the pill from being released into your stomach and thus digested ( killed ) .

"when was asthma first discovered ? The word asthma is derived from the Greek aazein , meaning “ sharp breath. ” The word first appears in Homer 's Iliad ; [ 2 ] Hippocrates was the first to use it in reference to the medical condition . Hippocrates thought that the spasms associated with asthma were more likely to occur in tailors , anglers , and metalworkers . Six centuries later , Galen wrote much about asthma , noting that it was caused by partial or complete bronchial obstruction . Moses Maimonides , an influential medieval rabbi , philosopher , and physician , wrote a treatise on asthma , describing its prevention , diagnosis , and treatment . [ 3 ] In the 17th century , Bernardino Ramazzini noted a connection between asthma and organic dust . The use of bronchodilators started in 1901 , but it was not until the 1960s that the inflammatory component of asthma was recognized , and anti-inflammatory medications were added to the regimen . `` It was Hippocrates ( 460-357 BC ) , the Greek physician , who first described asthma and its resulting 'spasms ' . Galen ( 130-201 BC ) , a Greco-Roman doctor , discovered that asthma was due to bronchial obstruction . He treated it with owl 's blood in wine . `` Italian physician Bernardino Ramazzini described a link between his patient 's asthma and their jobs as far back as the early 1900s . `` Until the late 1800s , the most popular method of delivering asthma medication into the lungs was smoke . `` In 1864 , Dr.Henry Hyde Salter identified animal dander as an asthma trigger . `` In 1901 , a Japanese scientist , Jokici Takamine , purifies adrenaline , found in the suprarenal glands of sheep ( discovered in 1898 ) and develops the first effective bronchodilator . `` In the 1960s , asthma researchers discovered that asthma is an inflammatory disease , not just constriction of the airways , and that asthma sufferers have a sensitive immune system which reacts to airborne allergens . The first inhaled anti-inflammatory medication is born . `` In 1972 , inhaled corticosteroids hit the market . `` - Fraser Health",1

"What is the preferred treatment for a large hematoma on the shin caused by trauma ? The area on the shin is large ( 3 inches by 2 inches ) and very swollen and has n't changed for 3 months . Doctor says it may take 6 months to `` go down '' and that , if not , it may need to be `` drained '' . The doctors are right . I developed one on my shin after a wreck . 6 months later it was flat and only minorly discolored , 8 months later it was no longer painful to the touch and the coloration had gone , 10 months later it no longer hurt to run . It does take a while , I would wait as long as you can to decide to get it drained , because I was told this can be painful . But if there 's absolutely no change in color or size after 7 months , you may want to go for it , cause that 's about when the calcification process starts ( Eventually it will turn hard . ) Healing time also depends on where the hematoma is located . If there is mostly bone and not alot of muscle mass , it may not take as long ( i.e . top of foot , hand , etc . ) In areas with much muscle mass and fat , it may take a long time , because the muscle absorbs all the protein.Here 's what you can do to hurry it a little : Fill a styrofoam cup with water and freeze.Tear the top rim off so a half inch or so protrudes like chapstick.Massage the hematoma lightly with this ice for 15 minutes at a time , 3 to 4 times daily.At night , use some form of localized heat , that can be comfortable and not dangerous or painfull . This will help promote bloodflow in that area.DO N'T rub or massage the area , you may make the area bleed again under the skin , starting you back at day 1.Eat a diet rich in protein.Get extra rest if the hematoma is on your legs or feet.Good luck , I hope this helps you .",1

But its human nature to feel superior to any perceived notion of lack of discipline or weakness .

So , dont be discouraged . At the end of all the problems , you 'd emerge as a much stronger person.So , hang in there . Try to talk to your friends/people who wont let you sulk .

Having a positive attitude and looking at the brighter side of things helps getting thru ' times like this.I 'd suggest that you do the following . Look at the problems and prioritize them .

Be a hero in the strife ! Lives of great men all remind usWe can make our lives sublime , And , departing , leave behind usFootprints on the sands of time ; Footprints , that perhaps another , Sailing o'er life 's solemn main , A forlorn and shipwrecked brother , Seeing , shall take heart again.Let us , then , be up and doing , With a heart for any fate ; Still achieving , still pursuing , Learn to labor and to wait .",1

First and foremost , stay away from any ab machine.For the upper abs , focus on crunches which effectively work the abdominals better than sit-ups or any machine on the market.For the lower abs , keep in mind there is very little muscle tissue there so decreasing levels of body fat is the most effective way to bring out the best in this area .

Endometriosis is the presence of normal endometrial mucosa ( glands and stroma ) ABNORMALLY implanted in locations OTHER than the uterine cavity . This tissue , possessing the same steroid receptors as normal endometrium , is capable of responding to the normal cycles of hormones . One theory of spread is thought to be dispersion of ectopic ( meaning where it should not be ) inplants throughout the peritoneal cavity ( area where your bowels , liver reside ) during menstruation , since sloughing off of products of endometrial tissue from the uterus is not just unidirectional ( out through the cervix then vagina , but also up through the fallopian tubes leading to the body cavity known as retrograde flow . This is common in women and ca n't fully explain endometriosis . Endometriosis has even been found on structures even above the diaphragm . Endometriosis responds and is driven by estrogen . There are reports of women with endometriosis occuring after hysterectomy and removal of the ovaries ( which makes estrogens ) . Women normally continue to make lower levels of weaker estrogens even after their ovaries have been removed . Some women for whatever reason continue to make high levels , and this is thought to be a reason for further symptoms.To answer your question simply , yes , it can still grow",1

"Fibromyalgia ? Help ? ? ? ? 15 yr old with severe fibromyalgia ... any tips ? Find answers to these issues and you will live with less pain More effective , guilt-free communications with family and friends about symptoms Avoiding frustrations at the doctor 's office , which may range from discussing symptoms to requesting specific therapies Handling demands on limited time Keeping up with job duties or household tasks without causing a flare-up Striving for and maintaining a better quality of life—one that makes you both happier and healthier How to respond to hurtful comments from others TreatmentIn general , treatment for fibromyalgia is with a combination of medication and self-care . The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health.MedicationsMedications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep . The ones most commonly recommended by doctors include : Analgesics . Over-the-counter acetaminophen ( Tylenol , others ) may ease the pain and stiffness caused by fibromyalgia . However , its effectiveness varies with individuals . Tramadol ( Ultram ) is a prescription pain reliever that may be taken with or without acetaminophen . Your doctor may have you take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) — such as aspirin , ibuprofen ( Advil , Motrin , others ) or naproxen sodium ( Anaprox , Aleve ) — in conjunction with other medications , but NSAIDs have n't proven to be effective in managing the pain in fibromyalgia when taken by themselves . Antidepressants . Your doctor may prescribe antidepressant medications , such as amitriptyline , nortriptyline ( Aventyl , Pamelor ) or doxepin ( Sinequan ) to help promote sleep . Fluoxetine ( Prozac ) in combination with amitriptyline has also been found effective . Sertraline ( Zoloft ) and paroxetine ( Paxil ) also are effective if you 're suffering from depression . These medications may be beneficial by affecting serotonin levels in the brain . Muscle relaxants . Taking the medication cyclobenzaprine ( Flexeril ) at bedtime may help treat muscle pain and spasms . Benzodiazepines . These drugs may help relax muscles and promote sleep . Usually , doctors avoid benzodiazepines in treating fibromyalgia because they have n't been shown to have long-term benefit and have the potential for drug dependence . Prescription sleeping pills , such as zolpidem ( Ambien ) , may provide short-term benefits for some people with fibromyalgia , but doctors usually advise against long-term use of these drugs . These medications tend to work for only a short time , after which your body becomes resistant to their effects . Ultimately , using sleeping pills tends to create even more sleeping problems in many people.Doctors do n't usually recommend narcotics for treating fibromyalgia because of the potential for dependence and addiction . Corticosteroids , such as prednisone , have n't been shown to be effective in treating fibromyalgia.Cognitive-behavioral therapyCognitive-behavioral therapy seeks to increase your belief in your own abilities and teaches you methods for dealing with stressful situations . Therapy can be provided via individual counseling , audiotapes or classes , and may help you manage your fibromyalgia.Treatment programsInterdisciplinary treatment programs may be effective in improving your symptoms , including relieving pain . These programs can combine a variety of treatments , such as relaxation techniques , biofeedback and receiving information about chronic pain . There is n't one combination that works best for everybody . Your doctor can create a program based on what works best for you . Self-careSelf-care is critical in the management of fibromyalgia . Important aspects of self-care include taking these actions : Reduce stress . Develop a plan to avoid or limit overexertion and emotional stress . Allow yourself time each day to relax . That may mean learning how to say no without guilt . But do n't change your routine totally . People who quit work or drop all activity tend to do worse than those who",1

"What makes people stop from taking their own life ? You make yourself stop . You stop seeing the advantage in being gone , in wanting to see others punished for not treating you as you think they should.And you start treating yourself as though you were someone special , someone that you really , really care about . You give them ( you ) the best of whatever you have - the best attention , the best potato chip out of the bag , the nicest clothes in your closet . You start telling yourself that you are someone special . Write notes and letters and stories about how good you are , and all the things you want to have and do and all the opportunities that are out there for you.And every day , you look in the mirror and say `` This is going to be a great day . '' Even if you do n't believe it , you say it . And you stop during the day and `` smell the roses . '' You find the things you like to do and you do them - because you are special and you deserve it.If you 're looking to punish people , this will annoy them much more , because you 'll have found a joy in life that they do n't have .

"Where is the gum ? I was told that my gum is healthy if I can see less than 4mm of it . But I thought the gum is the flesh connecting the teeth to the jaw , and I can see the entire pink flesh covering my teeth . There must be at least 1.5cm . How can it be less than 4mm ? Am I missing something ? The 4 mm probably refers to the depth of your gum pockets ( the space betwen the top of your gums to the alveolar bone that holds your teeth . Your dentist would measure this with a probe.If your pockets are deeper than 4 mm then it means that you have had bone loss which is usually caused by periodontal disease ( an infection in the gums ) . The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly ( brush at least twice a day for two minutes ) . I emphasize flossing , because often people do n't realize just how important it is . The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck , and therefore where bacteria sticks most often , too . The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch . So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth , you want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure you remove the plaque . So you should be going up and down two to three times along the tooth on both sides of the contact.Hope this helps !",1

"How does a Sonicare toothbrush charge with no metal connection points ? How do electrons pass through the plastic in the handle to charge the batteries inside ? I 'm sure it has to do with magnets or something , but I would like spacifics . You are on the right track . It relies on inductive charging : < quote > If you own an electric toothbrush , there 's a good chance that it has a completely sealed toothbrush unit . The toothbrush rests on the charger without any metal contacts to connect the toothbrush to the base . This has the great advantage of allowing the toothbrush to be completely sealed so that water can not enter through exposed contacts . It also avoids any problems with water getting into the contacts and shorting out the charger.This sort of sealed arrangement is called inductive charging . Essentially , the toothbrush and the base form a two-part transformer , with the base having one part of the transformer and the toothbrush having the other . When you slide the toothbrush onto the base , the complete transformer is created and charge can flow.The base contains one of the coils and the metal bar . The toothbrush contains the second coil . When you drop the toothbrush onto the base , you create the complete transformer ! < /quote >",1

"why is the risk of semen-to-mouth transmission less than semen-to-vagina ? Risk of HIV transmission from semen to vagina is supposed to be because of vaginal mucus membrane absorbing the virus . Mouth surface is also mucus membrane . So why risk of semen-to-mouth transmission is less than semen-to-vagina ? OK , ignoring the overly-emotional responses that some people have had to this question , it actually IS true that semen-to-mouth sex carries less of a risk of HIV transmission than semen-to-vagina . One caveat , though : The risk is NOT zero . Oral sex DOES carry a risk . Smaller , but a risk.Why ? No one has 100 % figured out . However , it is postulated that the digestive enzymes present in the saliva do a number on the HIV virus and are able to knock out a fair amount of the infectious little buggers . The vaginal secretions do n't contain these enzymes.So , no , our youth are NOT being lied to .",1

Your boyfriend needs to seriously consider testing for sleep apnea , especially if the snoring seems to be throat-based . I 'll just bet he has it , too . Age is not a factor ; I am told kids as young as 12 can have it.I have it and did n't know it . For me , it was n't a snoring issue ; it was an issue with not getting a restful night 's sleep . I 'd wake up in the morning and feel completely exhausted.I was tested three years ago and was shocked to find out that I stopped breathing 30 times in three hours , which essentially woke me up .

"How long after a nail puncture in my hand before I have to get a tetnis shot ? I do n't know the answer to this question , but ASAP sounds like a good plan.However , I will point out that it is not the rust that causes tetanus . It is microbes in the dirt ( usually from feces ) where the rusty nails often reside that cause the tetanus , plus the deep puncture wound that allow the spore to reach an environment that is not hostile to them . So a puncture would from surgical steel or zinc plated nails is just as likely to cause tetanus if they have been in the dirt .",1

In addition , it supports the activities of certain cells ( lymphocytes ) that produce immunity by reacting against specific disease-causing agents .",1

"whats the most effective treatment to kill lice eggs ? killing the bugs has n't been the problem those eggs are.I just want her hair pretty and shiney again and for this problem gone for good .I know to wash everything and to spray bedding and furniture.Thanks The problem is that you ca n't kill the eggs . The nits are encased in a very strong type substance that can not be penetrated . The most important thing is to retreat the hair after 7 to 10 days and you HAVE to get all the nits out by hand or by comb . I find those plastic combs ineffective . I ordered a metal comb called medi comb from a dealer on ebay . It works the best but you will still need to hand pick some . They are such a pain ! Also using hair styling products ( after hair is nit/lice free ) daily helps prevent reinfestation from contant with others ( at school/bus/etc. ) . I also flat iron/or hot iron curl her hair at times or braid it . Anything that keeps it back or helps to kill those pests ! Also watch closely the friends they play with and if you see any kind of scratching check the child immediately and send them home to tell their parents if you find any nits or anything . Check over the ears and nape of the neck . Also they do make lice repellent spray that you can order ( search online ) it 's mostly tea tree oil , eucalyptus , geranium , and other essential oils mixed with water but it could help if your child is in close proximity of other children and lice is a reoccurring problem . Prevention is the best medicine .",1
"how to increase self-esteem or confidence if you have acne scars and your classmates do n't have ? can you help me ? First recognize its not your fault . Its what makes you unique . You 're not sub-par , or defective , or less than others because you do n't have smooth flawless skin . You are different , but just as good . You still are beautiful/attractive . And others will think so too.Be happy . Have a pretty smile . Walk with confidence , knowing that you are beautiful/attractive . Focus on making others feel good about themselves . That 's really attractive . Walk with your head high . Shoulders back . Look at others in their eyes . Speak loud and clear . Smile often . Fake confidence until you feel it . At the same time , take good care of yourself , so that you can be your very best . Eat right . Drink plenty of water . Take vitamins . Get 8 hours sleep . Determine allergens , and eliminate them . ( I was seriously allergic to bleach , and it cause huge breakouts on my face ) Be proactive in treating your problems . Try products to help acne scars . ProActiv is very good on acne . But is you have deep scars , you need to resurface your skin . Try Obagi products . They work so well . You have to get them from a doctor or cosmetic surgen , and they are expensive , ( about $ 300 for about 3 months worth of supplies , after the initial kit , you just replace what you need at about $ 45 a month ) , but you 'll see beautiful skin . If you still feel down about yourself , try a bottle of the herb St. John 's Wort . You can buy it at Walmart . Its a mood elevator . It raises your melatonin and seratin levels and makes you feel better , so you can focus on the important things . Non-adddictive , and safe to use . Then do something that makes you feel proud of yourself . Stop doing things that you know are wrong . Set high goals . Volunteer . Teach a Sunday School class . Tutor children to read . Be nice to your family . Do other things to make you feel good about yourself . Your self esteem should be based on who you ARE and what you give to society . You want to look your best , and it makes you feel good , but your looks should NOT be the foundation of your self-esteem . How shallow is that ? And lastly , realize it could be a whole lot worse . I wish acne scars were my biggest problems in school .",1

I think by eating healthy foods like fruits , vegatables , and high fiber foods ( All Bran Cereal , etc . ) will help purify your body of toxins . This are seemingly foods that could help you . I was a counselor of addicts for three years , however , I concentrated moderately on diet . Be prepared to gain weight most likely , have lack of motivation , and constantly tired . Keep in mind that you are moving toward being healthy . These different aforementioned negative things are the biggest reasons meth users go back to the drug . I commend you highly on taking on such a huge leap in your life . No offense , and I ask you to take this jokingly . In the next few months , as you look in the mirror , and you see a tired , slightly plump , hardly movitivated person , take comfort in knowing that you are healthy and alive .

"my mother has fibromyalgia , anyone have ideas on treatments ? she currently uses heat and pain pills I have had Fibro since I was 16 and am now almost 36 . I have seen more doctors over the years than I can count from Neurologists to Rhuematologists to Chiropractors to Psychiatrists to Pain Specialists . In my experience pain medications do not work . A muscle relaxant is much more helpful . I have also tried biofeedback , steroid shots , trigger point injections , two sleep studies , nerve blocks , accupuncture , foot braces , wrist braces , carpal tunnel release surguries , and so much more . All just torture and I felt like a guinea pig.My best advise is make sure to get plenty of sleep , take a multiple vitamin , keep active in at least low impact sports , and consider Magnesium and Malic Acid supplements ( consult the doctor or a nutritionist to have her Magnesuim level checked- it is a simpe mouth swab and not painful ) , meditation does help some in keeping the pain back if you can seperate your mind from the pain , and try to take 2-3 warm Epson Salt baths a week ( Epson salt contains Magnesium and soaking in a warm tub of it helps to get the mineral into the body . Magnesium aids the muscles in using oxygen and when the level is low which is typical in Fibro it can cause are cramps , spasms , and pain . ) Also , Fibromyalgia is a neurotransmitter disorder and certain foods can trigger similiar symptoms to Fibro . Try to have her eliminate Monsodium Glutamate from her diet . I did and some of my symptoms ( chronic headaches and nausea ) went away . It is in everything from Doritos to chicken soup . A few key finding 's of an FDA study found MSG to cause a `` burning sensation in the back of the neck , forearms and chest '' . Otherwise , learn your limits and pace herself.Good luck !",1

Everyone has stress ; some stress is good , like a new baby , job , or house , while some is bad , like a failing relationship or a boss that you do n't get along with .

Eat a healthy , balanced diet , get enough rest , quit smoking , and limit your alcohol and caffeine intake . All of these actions will help you feel better and make you less likely to get a headache in the first place and more able to handle stress.Spend time with yourself . Set aside time everyday , even if it 's just five minutes , to relax and do whatever you want . Read , soak in a hot tub , or meditate .

Yes.If a person is taking medication for a bi-polar ailment , then the effects of alcohol can not be adequately surmised on the behavioral aspects of the person in question .

Alcohol , being a depressant , usually has the affect on this type of individual as making them reach their `` lows '' , and they can be quite violent and destructive.Anyone with bi-polar disease should ALWAYS be careful on ANY medications injested .

"Is Congenital heart disease sex linked ? Your question is heard to understand . Is it Sex linked ... as in whether it is male or female linked ? Nothing I have read would say that is is found nmore in one sex than another.Congenital means inborn or existing at birth . This is what I found on the site noted in the sources below : '' What causes congenital cardiovascular defects ? Congenital cardiovascular defects are present in about 1 percent of live births . They 're the most common congenital malformations in newborns . In most cases scientists do n't know why they occur . Sometimes a viral infection causes serious problems . German measles ( rubella ) is an example . If a woman contracts German measles while pregnant , it can interfere with how her baby 's heart develops or produce other malformations . Other viral diseases also may cause congenital defects.Heredity sometimes plays a role in congenital cardiovascular defects . More than one child in a family may have a congenital cardiovascular defect , but this rarely occurs . Certain conditions affecting multiple organs , such as Down 's syndrome , can involve the heart , too . Some prescription drugs and over-the-counter medicines , as well as alcohol and `` street '' drugs , may increase the risk of having a baby with a heart defect . Researchers are studying other factors . ''",1
"What is the best diet pill for weight loss ? Good question . I will answer by first saying that diet pills are a fraud . Any pill that says you can lose weight by taking it and doing nothing else is wrong.Losing weight is not losing weight if you put it back on . That ’ s what diet pills do , why do you think there is a new popular one every few months.Now if you wonder if there are any good supplements and my answer is yes.There are some supplements that you can take that can enhance a very healthy diet and fitness program and help you to stay committed to it . 7 Keto is an awesome metabolic enhancing compound that helps to reduce body weight and body fat by giving you more of a hormone that tells your thyroid to increase your metabolism . You may say wow , that ’ s what I need . No , the 7-Keto is all you need , not the other stuff . Yes but no , see the body can only take so much of it at a time before its eliminated by the blood and the rest becomes expensive urine . So you cant just take it alone , it must be part of a plan.Hoodia appears to affect the brain by making the stomach feel full and reducing the desire to eat . Offers safe , caffeine-free , non-stimulant weight management support . It also may help in metabolizing fats.Multivitamins - help you maintain the muscle that you have by providing nutrients your cells need . Understand if you don ’ t put enough nutrients in your body , you will lose muscle because your body will eat the muscle for those nutrients.These supplements should be part of an overall lifestyle change , to a healthier one.There are 5 most important things that must go together in any workout program . These are part of changing your complete lifestyle to one that is healthier . They also help you to naturally optimize your metabolism . The faster your metabolism the better your body uses your food for energy , instead of storing it as fat . I put them in the order of importance.1 . Eat more . Yes eat more . More meals that is . It is best to eat a small meal every 3-4 hours . The meal should be just large enough to where you are not hungry , as opposed to eating you are full . There is a difference . Eating 1 or 2 meals a day slows your metabolism down . You should have at least 4-6 meals a day . For most people , your food should be balanced between carbs proteins and fats in a 50-25-25 ratio . Throughout your day you should maintain this ratio 2 . Drink more water . Most of us don ’ t have enough water . This means our bodies are dehydrated . Two things a dehydrated body has trouble doing , one is releasing water . In order to lose fat you must be able to release water , because fat cells in your body are composed of mostly water . A dehydrated body can not build very well . Muscle tone indicates a constant building state in your body . If your body isn ’ t building that means it is losing muscle and it ’ s never good to lose muscle that slows your metabolism and makes you look flabby.3 . Maintain a balanced workout regimen of cardio and resistance ( weights ) . Cardio is good for fat burning and it ’ s easy to do and to progress yourself . Resistance is a little harder because it ’ s not as easy to know what to do . If weights aren ’ t your thing then try Yoga or Pilates . Both are very effective resistance and core training and can help you maintain lean muscle and increase your overall metabolism.4 . Smart supplementation of your diet is your best solution to making sure you get the nutrients your food doesn ’ t give you . I mentioned 7-Keto , Hoodia , and a multivitamin plus cleanse formulas , as well as detox formulas are awesome for eliminating toxins we take into our bodies without knowing.5 . Sleep is a very important part of any healthy lifestyle regimen . When we sleep our bodies and minds refresh themselves and allow us to function at an optimal level . Sleeping allows muscles to rebuild themselves and when they do that , it speeds your metabolism.You may ask why I gave you this long list instead of just telling you what exercises",1

hair products and skin prouducts ? wat r the best hair products 2 use 2 get my hair thick again its already long and wat about skin i have some littelblack dots from bumps and i need them 2 go way and dont like proactive As far as skin goes : Try the Mary Kay skin care line with customized skin care products for acne . The best thing to with your skin is always to keep it clean as well as treating breakouts . This helps prevent breakouts . There are five steps to basic skin care : 1 . Cleanse2 . Exfoliate3 . Tone/Freshen4 . Moisturize5 . ProtectThe Mary Kay 3 in 1 cleanser can do the first three steps in one . The fifth step is protect . You want to use an oil free foundation which our formulas for dry normal combo and oily skin are all oil free . When your skin is protected with foundation you can wash off the impurities that your skin catches in the air . The foundation catches the irritants and impurities instead of them getting into your pores causing further breakouts . Mary Kay is satisfaction guaranteed . So if you try it and it doesnt work for you you can get different products or your money back . Also it is so important that when you are using skin care you use one line be it Mary Kay or Avon or a Walmart brand . They are formulated to work with one another . Mixing products not designed to work together can cause reactions in some people . ; ) To even out skin tone you of course need to keep your skin exfoliated but also use a solution like our day and night solution . The day solution has SPF 25 in it and the Night Solution has Vitamin A and E and more in them . These collagen inducing products help to tighten and firm the skin as well as even out tone . You can add in our Microdermabrasion once or twice a week to totally exfoliate and remove dead skin . The second step of our microderm set will return your skin to its proper PH balance so you will not be rough or dry afterwards . I reccomend using products as follows but all skin care must be customized for an individual.Timewise 3 in 1 Cleanser ( customized for skin type ) Timewise Day Solution ( at night use Night Solution ) Timewise Moisturizer ( customized for skin type ) Timewise Firming Eye creamAdditional moisturizers if needed ( intense for dry spots etc ) Foundation ( customized for skin type and shade ) Color products ( use all oil free and non-comedogenic ) Hope this was helpful ! !

"Why do i do bad things when i know theyre bad , but i cant stop ? Why do i tell myself ill stop smokin , or poppin pills , or dealin or any of that , but i always end up doin it again ? Things like that sometimes seem easy to do , and get away with , but the repercussions can be burdensome . Also , they tend to glue you into a mindset and a lifestyle that may not be the best for your future . Putting yourself into active things , oftentimes using your body instead of your mind , is a good way to lose those feelings that can creep up on you and tempt you . A job , a hobby , a group , frienships , family time , are all good avenues . Sometimes leaving a situation you are in is a viable alternative , with friends , groups , etc . Life is not perfect , so finding a way to not feel totally out of whack when they happen can keep you level-headed . Forgiveness also keeps you from feeling like your carrying the load around with you . Also , the take some of that edge that we all fell like we are the most important thing around , and putting more selflessness , doing things for others even when you might not feel like it , can adjust your attitude toward feeling less alone . Guard your mind , what you put in it , or what you allow others to put in it , because this will affect how you think , and what you think about . Positive action is often the best thing for emotions that want to burst . How you act affects how you think , and vice-versa . In time , they become more a part of what you are and , hopefully , what you want to ideally become . Keep a your head up . Best to you !",1

"What can be done to prevent early ejaculation ? Natural Ejaculation Control Technique is a process where breathing techniques are combined with meditative efforts to stop premature ejaculation . How to practice : [ 1 ] Relax and control your breathing - inhaling and exhaling normally . Keep your eyes loosely closed . Put your tongue against the palate . Focus your mind between your eyebrows at the center of your forehead . [ 2 ] Inhale through your nose deeply at intervals of 2-5 seconds until you can feel your abdomen expand , maximizing the capacity of your lungs . Now , focus your mind to the center of your body , directly towards your navel . [ 3 ] Hold your breath and move your expanded abdomen downward by contracting your upper abdomen . As pressure gradually builds up against the bladder and the prostate gland , shift your mental focus to the prostate area . * Step 3 is the most important step during intercourse – it requires that you hold your breath for as long as possible while applying pressure to the bladder and prostate area . This will partially block sensitivity to the penis , allowing you to last longer and control ejaculation . [ 4 ] Contract your anus by clenching . Then exhale air slowly out of the mouth , shifting concentration once again towards the center of your forehead . * You should feel hot energy rising from the prostate area along the spinal cord to your head.Repeat this cycle several times . But remember , when using the anal clenching method during intercourse , your inhalations and contractions of the abdomen should coincide with your sexual thrusting motions.Although , this might seem difficult at first , with just a little practice ( alone or with a partner ) , you ’ ll soon master it .",1

"What are some good ways to stop smoking cigarettes. ? Methods of quittingCold Turkey methodNicotine Replacement Methods ( Patch , Gum , Nasal Spray ) Behavioral MethodsCognitive Therapy MethodOther Methods and adjuncts ( acupuncture , hypnosis , medications ) Factors for relapse while in the process of quittingPredictors of successful quittingCold turkey methodThis is the prefered method used by so called self changers , people who quit on their own and without any nicotine replacement by gum , patch or nasal spray . Little is known about this method as any research study would influence the results as it would no longer be a spontaneous process . Strong motivational factors are believed to play the foremost role in successful quitting using this method.Nicotine replacement therapyIn this method the nicotine delivered by the cigarette is replaced with nicotine delivered through the skin ( transdermal nicotine or nicotine patch ) , the nasal mucosa ( nicotine nasal spray ) or the buccal mucosa ( nicotine chewing gum ) . Several well designed clinical trials have shown the efficacy and safety of nicotine replacement the goal of which is to reduce cravings and ease withdrawal symptoms . Transdermal Nicotine Patches The nicotine patch is usually well tolerated , and provides constant , steady nicotine blood levels throughout the day and night when worn . They are quite simple to use , help prevent weight gain , cravings , and nicotine withdrawal symptoms and are socially acceptable Side Effects of the patch Patches may cause a local skin reaction , and insomnia with nightmares may occur . Overdosing in nicotine is possible , especially if a person smokes while wearing the patch . Smoking while wearing a patch is dangerous and may lead to stroke or heart attack . Use of the patch requires abstinence from tobacco products ... i.e . no smoking or chewing tobacco . Cost Patches are expensive and cost close to $ 100 per month of use . However bear in mind that smoking 1 ppd costs $ 1000 per year , which multipied by 10 years approximates the price of a car . Some people are tempted to cut the patch to save money . Nicoderm is the only patch that can be cut without destroying the patch 's ability to deliver nicotine through the skin to the bloodstream reliably.. It is not unsafe to cut the other patches as far as I know . However cutting the other patches impairs the transdermal drug delivery system , and may not provide reliable blood levels of nicotine . the key word here is reliable . The total dose of nicotine in the patch does not correlate at a milligram to milligram equivalency to the dose delivered to the bloodstream . The drug delivery system of the patch ensures that nicotine is transported thru the skin at a constant rate , and e ach manufacturer uses a different patented technology to do this . Only a portion of the total nicotine contained in the patch is transported thru the skin . Individual differences in skin thickness , location of the applied patch , and other related factors play a role in the total dose delivered . 3 Step Tapering Method of using the patch o The 21 mg patch is worn daily for 6-8 weeks for quitters who smoked an average of 1 ppd ( 2 ppd quitters may require 2 patches to alleviate cravings and withdrawal symptoms ) o The 14 mg patch is then worn daily for the next 2 to 4 weeks if the ex smoker remains confident in his or her ability to not smoke and if urges or cravings to smoke are controlled . o The 7 mg patch is then worn for 2-4 weeks if the same criteria as above are met . o In the absence of cravings and urge to smoke the patch is then stopped entirely . It is important to individualize the tapering method . . . Some people require longer periods of use , others shorter . If cravings intensify , return to the next higher dose of the patch .

The test itself having high levels really does n't tell anything by itself . You really need to discuss with your doctor if you have other symptoms , what they are , how severe they are , how frequent , what brings them on , and you would really benefit from keeping a journal of all that information , because sometimes there is so much you forget . Write down anything , sometimes things you think are no big deal can be relevant.If you had other tests taken , you should discuss those results as well . I have SLE ( lupus ) and I know from personal experience that it takes a lot of positive factors and time to determine a person even has an auto-immune problem . You are your own best advocate , so speak up for yourself . In the meantime , check out these websites , they may be able to help with information specific to the condition you are being checked for , support for you and your family , and possibly links to other sites that specialize in your particular problem . Good luck !",1

"What is Cancer ? Development of cancer , Types of treatment , effects of cancer Cancer is a disease of cells . It is an abnormal growth of cells which tend to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and , in some cases , to metastasize ( spread ) . Cancer is also called malignancy . A cancerous growth or tumor is sometimes referred to as a malignant growth or tumor . A non-malignant growth or tumor is referred to as benign . Benign tumors are not cancer . Cancer is not one disease . It is a group of more than 100 different and distinctive diseases . Cancer is NOT contagious.Cancer can involve any tissue of the body and have many different forms in each body area . Most cancers are named for the type of cell or organ in which they start . If a cancer spreads ( metastasizes ) , the new tumor bears the same name as the original ( primary ) tumor . The frequency of a particular cancer may depend on gender . While skin cancer is the most common type of malignancy for both men and women , the second most common type in men is prostate cancer and in women , breast cancer . Cancer frequency does not equate to cancer mortality . Skin cancers are often curable . Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer for both men and women in the United States today.Cancer is the Latin word for crab . The ancients used the word to mean a malignancy , doubtless because of the crab-like tenacity a malignant tumor sometimes seems to show in grasping the tissues it invades . Cancer may also be called malignancy , a malignant tumor , or a neoplasm ( literally , a new growth ) .TreatmentDevelopments in the treatment of cancer have led to greatly improved survival and quality of life for cancer patients in the past three decades . Traditionally , cancer has been treated by surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation therapy . In recent years immunotherapy has been added to that list . New drugs and techniques are constantly being researched and developed , such as antiangiogenic agents ( e.g. , angiostatin and endostatin ) , genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies , retinoid agents , and vaccine agents ( stimulating the immune system ) .",1

"why do some people get addicted to drugs and some do n't ? Addiction to drugs and alcohol tends to run in families and may have to do with how the brain processes certain chemicals , particularly those of the `` feel good '' type , which may be lacking or dormant in the addict until they are activated by drugs or alcohol . According to Carl Jung , alcoholic drinking is seen as a reflection of the human need , gone wrong , for a spiritual life . In a famous letter to Bill Wilson , Jung wrote that the craving for alcohol is the equivalent , on a low level , of the spiritual thirst of our being for wholeness , or union with God . Jungnotes that in the word alcohol in Latin is spiritus , a word that describes the highest religious experience , as well as the most depraving poison . In solving the problem of alcoholism , Jung offered the formula spiritus contra spiritum . A figurative translation of this Latin formular is , `` it takes the Spirit of God to overcome the harmful spirit of alcohol . ”",1
"What is a less toxic alternative to Chemo therapy for breast cancer treatment in a woman ? To be honest , chemotherapy is not a cancer treatment . Here is the situation . Chemo can take care of the problem right away , but the doctor always says that , some can live an extended 2 years , or 3 years . And some die right away from the chemicals . This is with late stages of cancer . Now , for early stages , it helps the problem but your health is deteriorated . They say that chemo affects the cancer and your normal body cells . How many people you know , who have had late stages of cancer , and lived through it pass 5 yours with chemo therapy ? I bet you that you have never even heard of it . Even if someone has , how many people is that compared to that masses ? The problem with other medicines is that the pharmaceautical companies can not control that product . What if it was tree bark say for instance . How many people do you know will buy the pills if they can just walk up to any tree and bite a piece off to save themselves ? See ? So , USA doctors are familiar with these remedies , but they do not talk about it . Try asking your doctor about green algae , or cesium chloride , or paw paw , etc etc . Then they start to talk . Otherwise , they wont say a word . And if you dont know , how can you ask ? So , the doctors lips are sealed tight . The individual doctors on the other hand are sometimes scared to talk about it . It is because , if they open their mouths , they would be facing the whole medical community . Alot of them go into the medical field to help people , and some go in it for money . But , the top ranking ones in control are all in it for money . If not , they would have never gotten their position . I do not suggest you go with chemo therapy . You can look up some alternative medicine to cancer and they are all over the place on the net . The best ranked one is cesium chloride , paw paw , and along with others . Some health websites even have a place where you can go and tell them your stage of cancer and which type of cancer , and they will sell you a package based on your individual problem . There are also some doctors scattered all over the USA who specialize in cancer . You never hear about them right ? Well , they wont be bothered by the medical community if they do a small operation without much advertising . But , they all report about 90 % survival rates on cancers that regular cancer doctors give up on . And if that doctor didnt give up , do you expect to live anyways ? No . I speak out to you because I dont want you to die like the two of my friends who have already died . Certain doctors even said that they could cure it with 80 % survival rate . But , I didnt have the money to help them . So , I am speaking out in hopes that nothing happens to you and you survive . Regardless of your stage of cancer . Cesium chloride is what works best . Look it up , its everywhere . Even oxygen drops help . You can use them both at the same time . The thing is with these alternatives is that , some of them make you feel extremely bad at the beginning , but after a while you get used to it , and then you are gone with the cancer before you know it . So dont feel discouraged . Oxygen drops keep cancer from growing because your body can live with more oxygen . As a matter of fact , it helps circulate your blood . Cancer can not live at the sight of oxygen . It has been said that not enough oxygen is what causes cancer . I dont know what the cause is , because there are many causes . But , cesium chloride and oxygen drops will take care of it . And one more thing , some of these remedies can not be sold as a cancer treatment . So , they are sold as vitamins . But , in their website , they are allowed to say what it cures . But , their labels can not say a word about cancer . So , you should start in the vitamin section of the internet . Good luck my friend .",1

"whats the best way to fight a cold ? The best way to fight the common cold virusEvery year , as each winter season approaches us , it gets harder and harder for people to avoid getting a cold . It never fails , just as soon as the weather changes a little and starts to turn cold , people begin to sniffle , sneeze and cough and the symptoms of the common cold begin to come around once again.But before you run out to the nearest store to buy a supply of tissues , cold medicine and soup , you need to understand exactly what you are up against . Your chances of being exposed to a cold germ will increase or decrease depending on the amount of contact you have with other people and how you take care of yourself.The cold germ is spread from person to person when someone , who is infected , sneezes or coughs into the air or on you . The airborne germ then enters someone else ’ s body through an orifice , like your eyes , nose or mouth . You can also catch a cold by touching something that a person who has been infected has also touched and then touching your mouth , nose or eyes.There are many things that you can do to prevent yourself from getting a cold.1 . You should wash your hands a lot . This frequent hand washing , especially when using any anti-bacterial soap , will help you to get rid of any potential germs that you might have come into contact with.2 . You should carry and use anti-bacterial hand lotion several times throughout the day . Use it especially when you can not get to a bathroom and you know you have touched something infected or have been near an infected person.3 . You should also get plenty of sleep or rest . If you are tired and fatigued , your body ’ s resistance decreases and you will find that you are more susceptible to colds.There are many ways that you can fight a cold once you have caught one.1 . You should eat spicy foods . Spicy hot foods will cause your body to expel mucus . When you eat these types of foods , your nose will start to run and you will begin to cough up mucus . Spicy foods work just like a natural decongestant but without side effects . This advice is good for those people who can not take over the counter medication.2 . You should drink plenty of liquids . Liquids like soup , water , juice and flat ginger ale will keep your body hydrated . This is true especially if you have a fever . During a fever , your body loses a lot of fluids . You will need to replenish what you have lost . Therefore you need to drink often throughout your illness . You should also avoid drinking any dairy drinks because the dairy will cause mucus to form and coat your throat making it very difficult for you to swallow and cough.3 . You should use a vaporizer . It will keep the air that you breathe moist . If you do not have a vaporizer handy , then just crack open the windows in your home . This is very important if you have an extremely warm and dry home . Cracking the windows will have the same effects that a vaporizer has .",1

They do work short term but there are better ways to boost your metabolism and lose the weight.There are several ways to boost your metabolism but lets look at the factors that drive your metabolism first . 1 . Genetics - you have very little control , but you are not a prisoner of your genes . 2 . Lean Muscle Mass - this one throws most people off because women think , oh no I dont want muscles and men think I guess I have to look like a body builder . Lean muscle mass is simply your weight minus the weight of your organs , bones , fluids and fat . You increase lean muscle mass primarily through eating properly , resistance exercise , and a lifestyle that doesnt promote catabolizing activites ( smoking , heavy drinking and drug use ) 3 . Frequency of meals - the more meals the more the metabolic processes take place in your body and the faster your metabolism.4 . Water Intake - dehydration is a major drag on metabolism.Most people are dehydrated and they dont know it.5 . Sleep - getting enough rest allows the body to function at a higher metabolic level.You will learn more than you ever knew about metabolism from my source .

"What are some symptoms to Manic Depression ? Bipolar Disorder ( Manic Depression ) Another type of depression is bipolar disorder , which was formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression . This condition shows a particular pattern of inheritance . Not nearly as common as the other types of depressive disorders , bipolar disorder involves cycles of depression and mania , or elation . Bipolar disorder is often a chronic , recurring condition . Sometimes , the mood switches are dramatic and rapid , but most often they are gradual.When in the depressed cycle , the person can experience any or all of the symptoms of a depressive disorder . When in the manic cycle , any or all of the symptoms listed under mania may be experienced . Mania often affects thinking , judgment , and social behavior in ways that cause serious problems and embarrassment . For example , unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is in a manic phase.A significant variant of bipolar disorder is designated as bipolar II . ( The usual form of bipolar disorder is referred to as bipolar I . ) Bipolar II is a syndrome in which the affected person has repeated depressive episodes punctuated by what is called hypomania ( mini-highs ) . These euphoric states in bipolar II do not fully meet the criteria for the complete manic episodes that occur in bipolar I. Depression Symptoms of Manic DepressionPersistently sad , anxious , or `` empty '' mood . Feelings of hopelessness , pessimism . Feelings of guilt , worthlessness , helplessness . Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed , including sex . Insomnia , early-morning awakening , or oversleeping .

"what is Tourette Syndrome ? Tourette Syndrome Gilles de la Tourette syndrome ( Tourette Syndrome or TS ) is a neurological disorder which becomes evident in early childhood or adolescence between the ages of 2 and 15 . Tourette syndrome is defined by multiple motor and vocal tics lasting for more than one year . Many people have only motor tics or only vocal tics . The first symptoms usually are involuntary movements ( tics ) of the face , arms , limbs or trunk . These tics are frequent , repetitive and rapid . The most common first symptom is a facial tic ( eye blink , nose twitch , grimace ) , and is replaced or added to by other tics of the neck , trunk , and limbs . These involuntary ( outside the patient 's control ) tics may also be complicated , involving the entire body , such as kicking and stamping . Many person report what are described as premonitory urges -- the urge to perform a motor activity . Other symptoms such as touching , repetitive thoughts and movements and compulsions can occur . There are also verbal tics . These verbal tics ( vocalizations ) usually occur with the movements ; later they may replace one or more motor tics . These vocalizations include grunting , throat clearing , shouting and barking . The verbal tics may also be expressed as coprolalia ( the involuntary use of obscene words or socially inappropriate words and phrases ) or copropraxia ( obscene gestures ) . Despite widespread publicity , coprolalia/copropraxia is uncommon with tic disorders",1

"Has anyone ever gone to the eye doctor regarding `` eye floaters '' ? And if you did , what did they tell you to do ? This problem is bothering me a lot and I 'm not sure if I should go to the doctor about it or not . I 've never had them , but floaters that are just simply annoying , treatment is not necessary . If they are so dense and numerous that they affect your vision , then you should see your doctor . If you suddenly see new floaters , or eye floaters accompanied by flashes of light or peripheral vision loss , it could indicate serious conditions such as diabetic retinopathy ; vascular abnormalities such as retinal hemorrhages or carotid artery disease , or the beginning of a retinal detachment . In this case you should also see your doctor .",1

"When someone looses a lot of weight , where does all the fat and `` disposed '' weight go ? from what I learned in my anatomy class , when you gain fat cells you never lose them .

"What is your opinion of scientific medicine ... ? Do you think doctors , drug companies , etc . have ( in general ) our best interest in mind ? Do you think we have become a society too dependent on pills ? Do you think there is a real , significant benefit to using herbs and natural `` cures '' and preventatives as opposed to either using `` medicine '' or not using anything ? How do you deal with the people who think you are a quack for believing in natural remedies ? That 's quite a bit to sort through . I 'll do my best.I believe that individual doctors almost always have the best interests of their patients in mind . Medicine as a whole , however , is far more interested in the bottom line . This applies especially to the drug companies . From what I understand certain diseases do n't have enough people suffering from them to make it profitable to research treatments for them . Or , if the research has been done , there is not enough profit in manufacturing drugs to treat these people . I 've even read that there are boutique chemists who make , by hand , very small runs of certain drugs at no profit to themselves , simply to help out.As far as I 'm concerned , this is inexcusable . Do I have a solution ? No . Are alternative treatments viable ? I 'm sure that sometimes they are and sometimes they are not . Again , the problem comes down to making a buck . People who are suffering are , unfortunately , easy marks and snake-oil-salesmen have known this since the dawn of civilization.The problem becomes sorting the con-men from the well-meaning , but dangerously untrained , from the people with actual remedies . This is very difficult and requires a tremendous amount of work on the part of people who often lack the time and energy to do the necessary legwork because they are sick.Coretta Scott King died seeking medical help from a quack . It is awful that she suffered such an undignified end , but as long as there are people to be taken advantage of , others will do their best to part them from their money . Obviously not all alternative treatments are quackery , but they often get lumped together because of the actions of a few ( many , actually ) bad apples . I would suggest that the alternative-therapy industry engage in harsher self-policing as a way to remove the undeserved black-mark.As for you responding to questions which are specifically targeted at individuals , I welcome this . The thing that I like most about Yahoo Answers is that it is a place that encourages the free exchange of ideas between anybody . I do n't think that anyone can , or should , get upset when a targeted question receives several answers . That 's the best thing about this place . So , feel free to throw your two cents in anytime . I really appreciate your response about Bush and Christians . I 'd be very curious to hear what this man , who presumes to speak for all Christian Americans would have to say about that . Thanks for your input .",1

"What does sexual side effect mean ? Personal Side Effectsof StatinsImpotence , Loss of Libido and Erectile Dysfunction The pharmaceutical industry would lead us to believe that rapidly bottoming out our natural cholesterol levels through the use of their highly touted statin drugs is a relatively innocuous process of definite benefit to society . But as we learn more each day of this ubiquitous and unique cholesterol substance , we must question the veracity of their medical advisors . Cholesterol is perhaps the most important substance in our lives for we could not live without an abundant supply of it in our bodies . Researchers everywhere are learning how extraordinarily complex and often surprising are the pathways that produce and metabolize cholesterol . Cholesterol is the precursor for a whole class of hormones known as the steroid hormones that are absolutely critical for life , as we know it . These hormones determine our sexuality , control the reproductive process , and regulate blood sugar levels and mineral metabolism . This same substance that society has been taught to fear happens to be our sole source for our hormones , androgen , estrogen and progesterone .",1

( Glycosylated hemoglobin [ HbA1c ] should be less than 7 % . ) Renal disease - Proteinuria is a good marker for the development of DR ; thus , patients with diabetic nephropathy should be observed more closely.Systemic hypertension - Increased risk of retinopathy ( DR with superimposed hypertensive retinopathy ) Triglycerides and lipids - Normalization of lipid levels reduces retinal leakage and exudates deposition.Pregnancy - DR can progress rapidly in pregnant women , especially those with preexisting DR . Physical : Funduscopy under stereopsis and high magnification should be performed on every patient with diabetes to assess for DME and DR. An indirect ophthalmoscope does not provide adequate magnification for the ophthalmologist to diagnose DME.DME is defined as retinal thickening within 2 disc diameters of the center of the macula.Focal edema is associated with hard exudate rings resulting from leakage from microaneurysms.Diffuse edema results from breakdown of blood-retinal barrier with leakage from microaneurysms , retinal capillaries , and arterioles.CSME , as defined by the ETDRS , exists with any of the following findings : Retinal thickening within 500 mm of the center of the foveaHard , yellow exudates within 500 mm of the center of the fovea with adjacent retinal thickeningAt least 1 disc area of retinal thickening , any part of which is within 1 disc diameter of the center of the foveaOther physical findings that should be noted include the following : Visual acuity is an important parameter in following the progression of CSME , although it does not aid in the diagnosis of CSME because patients may have a visual acuity of 20/20.The status of the posterior hyaloid ; detached , taut , thickenedCauses : Causes include the following : After 20 years of the disease , nearly all patients with type I diabetes mellitus and 60 % of patients with type II diabetes mellitus will have some degree of retinopathy.Poor control of blood sugar increases the risk of diabetic retinopathy.Renal disease can be a marker for the development of diabetic retinopathy.Systemic hypertension increases the risk of diabetic retinopathy.Elevated lipid levels increase the risk of leakage and exudate deposits .",1

Other causes include cold showers , entering or leaving a hot or cold room , sudden excitement , and stress . Hiccups are not a serious medical condition and usually disappear on their own within a few minutes . If they last longer than 24 hours , hiccups may be a sign of another condition or injury . You should see your health care provider if you experience prolonged hiccuping . Home remedies are usually the primary treatment for hiccups , although no one is really sure how well they work . Hiccup home remedies include sneezing , being suddenly frightened , holding your breath , gargling , drinking pineapple juice , drinking water rapidly , sipping ice water , or swallowing dry granulated sugar . These activities may help by altering breathing patterns .",1

"why does it feel good to kill brain cells ? should n't that feel bad ? First of all most of the substances that are widely believed to kill brain cells do not . They will however alter the chemistry of the brain . This is not to say that it 's good to do these things . It is mostly due to the anti drug histeria that began in the early 20th century . Most drugs were used as medicine in the early days . It 's when drug abuse occurs that it can be of such a detriment . You can do very real damage to your brain with some of the most widely used drugs available today , alcohol among them . But it is the inhalants that do the damage the fastest . They impart chemical compounds into the bloodstream instead of Oxygen . Thus the brain is robbed of its most vital element . Brain cells then die by the millions . The notion that you become brain damaged by using marijuana or opiates is a bit misleading . The balance of normal brain chemicals is altered , maybe forever , but they are still not killing brain cells . Cocaine is another drug commonly used . It effects the brain chemistry also , but is more damaging to the heart . It kills heart cells on contact in laboratory experiments . It may also be harmful due to the powerful solvents it contains as a residue leftover from its manufacturing process . If you are going to use these substances you should at least inform yourself as to the damage you 're doing to your body .",1

"pain in my left ovary ? First , are you certain it 's your ovary ? Also in your left lower quadrant is your sigmoid colon , which may be diverticulitis . If you 're older ( > 50 ) , this would be more common . More suggestive of an ovarian source of your pain is whether it 's cyclical or not . If it 's constant throughout the month , it 's less likely your ovary ( less likely , but still possible ) . It could be an ovarian torsion , or ovarian cyst ... the list of things it could be is pretty long . It could also be endometriosis .

"Does conditioner damage hair ? Does regularly using conditioner contribute to alopecia ( receding harline ) ? *Noddling solemnly* While many disagree I have to say yes , chemicals ( even in conditioners and shampoos ) can damage hair . One should only wash their hair often enough to keep it clean . Daily doses can over do it , especially if you use the rinse and repeat method.Now I can not say if this is the cause of your problem , but beware products that contain alcohol or lauryl sulphate as they dry out hair and make it brittle.Most people routinely lose between 70 and 150 hairs from their scalp each day , mainly through washing , brushing , and combing.Scalp hair starts to thin when more hairs are lost through normal shedding than the scalp is able to renew . About 40 % of the density of scalp hair has to be lost before thinning of the hair becomes noticeable.Hair loss can be caused by : * Heredity . Most balding is caused by a genetic predisposition - in other words , it 's part of a person 's genetic makeup . This is called male pattern baldness , or hereditary balding or thinning . It is the most common cause of thinning hair . * Illness , certain physical conditions , or their treatments . This can include high fever , thyroid disease , childbirth , inadequate protein in the diet , iron deficiency , cancer treatments , the use of certain medications , and other causes.For more see http : //www.ehealthmd.com/library/hairloss/HL_whatis.htmlSome good alternatives are found here http : //www.answerbag.com/c_view.php/1654",1
"how do you get rid of pregnancy nausea ? Cinnamon tea , an old herbal remedy may help and it does not cost much to try it if you like and can drink cinnamon tea . Steep 2 � tablespoon cinnamon bark or powder in boiling water for ten minutes . Strain , add honey to taste and drink � cup three times a day before meals . You may also buy herbal cinnamon tea bags available at most supermarket.Pregnancy is such an exciting time in life , but for some it is marred by the discomfort of morning sickness or nausea . This is most unpleasant at best and if severe , dehydration can cause multiple problems . None of this is necessary as there is an effective way to relieve the nausea with Myofascial Trigger Point Therapy ( Applied pressure to trigger points in a muscle area ) .Although it has not been proven , the ongoing theory is that hormonal changes trigger spasm in the Pyloric Sphincter ( the muscle surrounding the opening that leaves the stomach ) . Because Myofascial Trigger Point Therapy can relieve muscle spasms of all sorts , it can also relieve the Pyloric Sphincter spasm causing morning sickness , known in the medical field as Hyperemesis Gravidarum . The nausea can start about the 4th week of pregnancy up until the 12th week and for some into the 2nd trimester.However , I have discovered an easy method to eliminate morning sickness . During this stage , the trigger points in the Pyloric Sphincter area are very tender , usually painful and just too uncomfortable to put pressure on one self ; therefore you will need a friend or your husband to help you . You may feel nauseated right afterwards but do not feel discouraged there will be relief a bit later . You may need to repeat this every 3 hours if the nausea returns . If the trigger points are too tender to repeat every 3 hours , repeat every 6 hours . This way you can at least get some food and fluids down to maintain good nutrition.If the nausea is severe , try eating only food , ( omitting liquids ) at meal times and take your fluids between meals . Milk just brought to the boil and then refrigerated is quite pleasant and a good food source.Let me explain why it works and how I discovered it . I am a Registered Nurse and have worked many years in the anti-partum unit at a good size hospital in Orange County . This unit treats patients with difficult pregnancies . One of the common problems is dehydration due to severe nausea called Hyperemesis Gravidarum . Most doctors prescribe intravenous fluids and medication for nausea . This does not always work and the nausea and vomiting often continues which puts the patient in a starvation situation forcing the treating doctor to order Hyper alimentation fluid . A complete nutritional fluid given intravenously that costs approximately $ 500 a bag and is given over a twenty-four hour period . The patient is still nauseated and vomiting but is fed nutritionally and may need this feeding for 2 to 3 weeks and sometimes more.Now I found that if I used an easy method of helping the pregnant mom and taught her husband how to help his wife , when she was first admitted and given some intravenous fluid she would go home in a day or two . However if I was not on duty and and the patient had been started on the Hyper alimentation fluid , my method did not seem effective . The patient would still suffer nausea although she would receive adequate nutrition.So if you are pregnant , fear nausea and want to make sure you feel good all the time and not have to go through all this hospital suffering , you may want to print this health tip . Have your husband help with the procedure even before you experience nausea , just as a preventative measure.NOTE : This procedure may also bring some very quick relief from gastric problems when they are caused by spasm of the Pyloric Sphincter.FOLLOW THIS EASY METHOD : Xiphoid Process.gif ( 7811 bytes ) 1 ) Have the mother lie flat on her back with her helper to one side.2 ) Start two inches below the Xiphoid Process which is the bottom tip of the S",1

"What is a Rife Generator and how does it work ? I 'll post here my answer that I gave when another person asked the same question a month or so ago.The Rife machine is legit depending on what model or manufacturer you got it from . There was a company in the late 80 's to early 90 's called LER that made what they named the REM SuperPro Generator . Though I ca n't vouch for any of the newer models , I can say that Rife 's technology was right on if you can find an original model.YES it shattered cancer cells , YES he was heralded as having found the cure for all diseases , YES he had 100 % success rate on the patients in the Pasadena county hospital . A Rife machine uses scalar waves , along the now established fact that every organism operates at its own distinct frequency . By increasing the resonance , a particular organism can be destroyed without harming the tissue around it . Rife meticulousy recorded the M.O.R . ( mortal oscillatory rate ) for the thousands of micro-organisms he could see under his universal microscope . A properly built Rife frequency generator can not hurt , except for a brief healing crisis , followed by an incredible feeling of health and well-being taken from years of testimonials ( unless you have a pacemaker from what I 've heard ) . A good amount of reading on Rife 's story can be found at some of the links below.Unfortunately most of his work was destroyed because of the newly created AMA and FDA that came into power . They ruled Rife 's work did not fall under their now established guidelines for medical practice , and with the government to back them up , it was the end for his discovery .",1

"What kind of psychotherapy works the best ? The answer to your question is not easy . Some therapists use a limited approach ( ie . only interpersonal , focused on your relationships with others . ) In my opinion , CBT ( Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy ) is often successful if other approaches have failed . I am the maintainer of a portal called http : //health.wikispaces.com that is helping to answer ( I hope ) precisely these kinds of questions . It is Invitation-Only , so that it is not open to misinformation . ( people who can access the site can also edit it to add their own research , and experiences . ) The answer to your question is that depending on the reason you are seeking psychotherapy , different methods will work best.I think this is really a multistep question , so I am going to give you some sources of information and then ask you to come back for a follow-up.WebMD.com , using experts from the Cleveland clinic ( WebMD uses different sources , some of which are not very comforting ) , has a detailed article on psychotherapy I highly recommend : http : //www.webmd.com/content/article/60/67128.htmI am going to add to this . The first thing you should discuss with any therapist is what brought you to see them , and what your goals are , and also billing . Insurance will often cover up to a certain amount ; some therapists or social workers ( both do therapy to some degree ) work on a sliding pay scale ( ie . they negociate on rate you pay . ) http : //www.webmd.com/content/article/60/67128.htmMy local counselor here at Earlham College in Richmond , IN says that eclectic therapists are the best -- ie . the ones that can use any approach that seems helpful . ( She has a Masters in Social Work . ) Therapists vary . Some are really good and give you specific directed guidance . Techniques are being researched all the time . I just saw a really good article on 'resellience therapy ' which sounded really cool . ( If you are interested , I will provide you with the link . ) Let me know how I can best assist you ! -- Sam , journalist and healer of myself",1

"Is it common for the surgical pen ( attatched to a broken leg ) to poke thru the skin ? My cat recently broke her back right femur in 5 seperate splinters and had to have a surgical pen adhered to the bone with wires . How common is it for it to shift up and actually pierce thru the skin ? Does this happen often in the mediacl industry , in humans or animals ? What could have caused it ? It can . Some procedures ( with humans ) require either external braces that are acually attatched to the bone via pins and screws . Some are temporary screws that are left sticking out of the bone that eventually may protrude through the skin . The doctors do n't make them flush with the surface of the bone because that makes it easier to remove them . However , the inside of bones is sterile . If bacteria is introduced , there could be a severe , life-threatening infection brewing . I would call your cat 's vet .",1

"what are the solutions for female hair lossing ? The most common type of hair loss seen in women is androgenetic alopecia , also known as female pattern alopecia . Alopecia means baldness , but just as in men , it does not have to be complete hair loss . This is seen as hair thinning predominantly over the top and front of the head . It affects approximately one-third of all susceptible women , but is most commonly seen after menopause Female pattern hair loss may begin as early as puberty . In these cases if there are signs of hormone imbalance , such as excess facial or body hair , a hormone evaluation should be done . Hormonal changes are a common cause of female hair loss . Many women do not realize that hair loss can occur after pregnancy or following discontinuation of birth control pills . It may also follow any sudden physical or psychological stress to the body . These types of hair loss are `` Telogen Effluvium '' and are usually temporary . It is important to remember that this hair loss may be delayed by up to three months following the change . Up to 8 months will be required for regrowth to be fully achieved.Treatment often starts with Rogaine ( topical minoxidil 2 % ) . Rogaine is the only FDA approved medication currently available for female pattern hair loss . The other hair loss medication , Propecia , just does n't work in women at all . Aldactone ( spironolactone ) pills help many women , especially whose hair loss starts before menopause but takes many months . Hormone replacement pills , such as Prempro , plus Aldactone are better after menopause . Experienced hair transplant surgeons can often achieve excellent results in women with the new follicular unit and minigraft techniques . You have to be a qualified candidate and have realistic expectations .",1

Do any drugs make it speed up or flare up ? What is known ? Sun is bad , does it cause it to speed up too ? NCB Seems like they do n't know much about MS . The cause of progression in MS is unknown . A relapse can occur if you become over-heated , overly stressed , overly fatigued ... or it can just happen . No lifestyles that I 'm aware of make a difference in the progression . No foods , either . Supplements that boost your immune system should be avoided , because MS is a disease caused by an `` over active '' immune stem in the first place . Anything that stimulates your immune system could lead to a new attack or an exacerbation . The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people diagnosed with MS begin treating with the `` ABC '' drugs ( Avonex , Betaseron , or Copaxone ) as soon as possible . While they do not `` cure '' MS , they do slow down the progression of the disease and prolong the progression of disability .

"sprained ankle ? I sprained my ankle training for a marathon during the summer & it still hurts to run . How come it 's taking so long to heal & are there any exercises I can do to help it along faster ? If an ankle sprain does not heal correctly , the joint may become unstable , resulting in a weakened and easily reinjured ankle . Proper initial care of your sprained ankle is critical . A compression wrap helps decrease swelling . If swelling is kept to a minimum , you will heal faster and get back on your feet sooner . Applying a compression wrap is easy and can be done at home . Elastic bandages are inexpensive and available at most drugstores . A protective brace can be worn over a compression wrap if you try to bear weight on your injured ankle . A compression wrap , such as an elastic ACE bandage , can hold the ankle in place and protect it from further injury . It also helps decrease swelling . A compression wrap should be worn for the first 24 to 36 hours.Also , try soaking it in hot water and epsom salts . I sprained both of mine playing football .",1

Prolactin is made up of 199 amino acids , and has a molecular weight of about 23,000 daltons . Prolactin has many effects , the most significant of which is to stimulate the mammary glands to produce milk ( lactation ) .Increased serum prolactin during pregnancy causes enlargement of the mammary glands of the breasts and increases the production of milk . However , the high levels of estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy acts directly on the breasts to stop ejection of milk . It is only when the levels of these hormones fall after child birth that milk ejection is possible.Sometimes , newborn babies ( males as well as females ) secrete a milky substance from their nipples .

"What can be done to imporove peripheral artery disease ? vze2wy4t RN , I believe you are thinking of venous disease ( as in varicose veins ) when you suggest elevating the limb . Although walking , and smoking cessation are the first steps . Support hose are to help improve VENOUS return.In lower extremity arterial occlusive disease the dependent position ( ie feet down ) aids in circulation to the smaller blood vessels in the feet and lower extremeties . Many patients who complain of pain at rest , have a history of having worse pain at night while in bed sleeping , with relief from `` dangling their feet from the side of the bed '' . Before you decide to do anything , see your physician if you have not already done so . There are other disease proceses that may mimic peripheral artery occlusive disease . If it is arterial disease he will be able to better answer your questions , after a good examination . If it is warranted , ( after more involved tests ) referal to a vascular surgeon might be necessary . Good luck.http : //www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml ? identifier=4692",1

"how did the idea of 3 square meals a day come about ? I think it has something to do with nutrition and your metabolism . You need to eat every 3-4 hours to keep your metabolism going .

It keeps you from having deficiencies . Today however , it is often recommended that one consume 5-6 smaller meals .",1
"What is nesidioblastomia ? It 's disease of some kind , but I am not sure what it is . nesidioblastosis Nesidioblastosis is a controversial medical term for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia attributed to an abnormal microscopic appearance of pancreatic islet development . The term was coined in the first half of the 20th century . The abnormal histologic aspects of the tissue included the presence of islet cell enlargement , islet cell dysplasia , beta cells budding from ductal epithelium , and islets in apposition to ducts.By the 1970s , nesidioblastosis was primarily used to describe the pancreatic dysfunction associated with persistent congenital hyperinsulinism and in most cases from the 1970s until the 1970s , it was used as a synonym for what we now refer to as congenital hyperinsulinism.The term fell into disfavor after it was recognized in the late 1980s that the characteristic tissue features were sometimes seen in pancreatic tissue from normal infants and even adults , and is not consistently associated with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia . Most congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by different mechanisms than excessive proliferation of beta cells in a fetal pattern.A small number of case reports have purported to describe nesidioblastosis in adults",1
"Pro-lifers , answer me this ... ? Without getting all passionate and calling out God 's name , can you explain in calm tones and with facts , why pro-lifers think that they have the right to demand that other women follow their beliefs and not have abortions ? Consider this:1 . If you believe that abortion is morally wrong , and someone else disagrees , why is it okay for you to insist that they share your views ? After all , Hindus think its wrong to eat cows , and i 've met pro-lifers who enjoy burgers . Isnt a difference in morals normal ? 2 . if you are so against abortion , would you adopt a woman 's child if she cancelled her procedure ? would you adopt EVERY SINGLE CHILD that would otherwise be aborted ? and if not , does n't that make you a hypocrite ? 3 . Many pro-choicers are n't pro-abortion and would not have one themselves . They believe in the right of a woman to have a choice . What do you base your right to force your ideals onto others on ? ( and please , do n't say religion . What if the woman is an atheist ? ) I am not a pro-lifer but the way I see it - which could be wrong - without repeating what others said is that you can not kill a soul.I believe in reincarnation . OK ... .once born : different question and a dilemna.But on the whole : is an unwanted child better ? I do n't think so at all . What if people were forced to adopt a child they did not want ? Life for everyone would be very miserable.And to those out there : sometimes girls need to hide the fact from the family so putting up for adoption is out of question . The family would resent it a lot and force the girl to have and keep the child.Children should be wanted and loved . If that is not the case , better have an abortion rather than raise an unfit , miserable human being .",1
"why do we yawn ? yawning is an automatic response from your body when it detects that there is a lack of oxygen . It causes you to involuntarily yawn , an action that sucks in additional air in a gulp to circulate in your body .",1
"I am 21 so why do n't i have regular periods ? Hormonal imbalances . Usually caused by diet . If you are too thin , you may not have enough body fat - it 's actually the cholesterol in your body ( fat ) that is used to make estrogen . Fatter women tend to look `` softer '' or more feminine.Estrogen is used to make the lining of your uterus that you shed every month.But progesterone is used to coagulate the lining so it sheds at a regular time period . It 's released after the egg is released , so it gets higher just before your period . Certain foods can interfere with the balance of estrogen and progesterone . Soy foods are particularly high in estrogen and can throw things off balance . Progesterone is also released from the adrenal glands , which also release cortisol - a stress hormone . Too much stress makes the adrenals concentrate on releasing cortisol and not on progesterone . Again , things get out of balance.Try to eliminate soy products ( and they are everywhere - most `` vegetable oils '' are soy oil ) and see if that helps . Do some deep breathing and meditation to relax and reduce the cortisol levels .",1

"what causes itchy hands ? Itchy hands are most often associated with a skin condition or rash . The commonest of these is eczema . This itching could be due to an allergy to something you have come into contact . Common allergy causing agents are household detergents or factors linked to your occupation . It is very unlikely that the itching is related to your circulation . There are other conditions that give rise to itching but the itch tends to be more generalised all over the body . You will need to visit your GP so he or she can assess your hands and advise you on the likely cause and treatment .

"how to treat plantar faciitis ? There are several things you can try.Anti-inflammatory medications like Ibuprofen or Naproxen may be helpful , taken with food.Fill an empty soda bottle with water and freeze . With a sock on , roll your heel over the ice bottle for 10-15 minutes , 3-4 times a day.NEVER go barefoot ! NOt even to the bathroom in the middle of the night . Always have good supportive shoes on.Stretching your calf muscle may help , particularly if you have a tight achilles to begin with . Face a wall , and place your plans on it . With the affected leg further behind you , lean into the wall , keeping your back leg straight and the heel on the floor . Then stretch with your knee slightly bent.If these methods do n't work , see your health care provider . A stronger anti-inflammatory medicine may be prescribed , he or she may evaluate you for orthotics , or supports that go into your shoes . Physical therapy may be helpful , and some people even have a cortisone injection into the heel .",1
"Has anyone heard of the `` sleep cure '' ? Supposedly it 's a means to lose a fair amount of weight over the course of a few days . You 're sedated and you wake up days later having lost 8-10 pounds . Real , or just some fictional fantasy that keeps cropping up in various books ? Sounds like some serious wishful thinking to me , combined with some misinterpreted observation.If you weigh yourself right before bed and then first thing in the morning , you will find that you 've lost a couple of pounds overnight . However , you 'll find by that evening that the weight is back.Makes it look like the best way to lose weight is to sleep , eh ? But it 's just water weight . You go to bed hydrated , you wake up dehydrated . Bummer.Sleeping for a few days may net you more weight loss , but some of that will be a loss in muscle ton , which will result in making it even harder to lose more weight and a good probability of gaining more weight than you lost.The best way to lose weight is to stop trying to lose weight . Instead , concentrate on improving your health . Yeah , yeah , exercise and eat right . * There 's a lot of details missing in those four words , but the gist is that any attempt to lose weight that does n't involve those activities are just ways of screwing your health for looks . The reason that I say stop trying to lose weight ? Weight is too complex a system to control reliably and any method that involves looking at a scale regularly will have a very good chance of just frustrating you to the point of giving up .",1

"Why do my feet smell so bad ? The main reason some people 's feet ( or more precisely , some people 's socks and shoes ) smell worse than other people 's is that some people sweat more than other people . This is just one of the many variable physiological qualities of human beings . This is also why sometimes your feet smell much worse than at other times -- it all has to do with how much you sweat.So , since foot odor is caused by bacteria digesting sweat , there are two main ways to reduce the stink . You can : * decrease the amount of bacteria on your feet * decrease the amount of sweat that collects on your feet and in your shoes Reducing the level of bacteria is really a matter of cleanliness . To control the bacteria population on you feet , you should : * wash your feet with strong anti-bacterial soap * wear clean socks * do n't wear the same shoes everyday - give a pair of shoes 24 hours or more to air out before wearing them again To reduce the amount of sweat that collects in your shoes , you should : * wear well-ventilated shoes instead of very constrictive shoes , such as boots * always wear socks , preferably made of cotton or other absorbent materials that absorb a lot of the sweat so the bacteria ca n't feed on it * change your socks a few times a day * buy some absorbent Odor-Eater type shoe inserts * apply an antiperspirant to your feet If your foot odor is really bad and these solutions do n't help much , then you should see a doctor . There are a number of prescription drugs that can treat serious foot odor , some by killing bacteria and some by reducing foot sweat .",1

Your knee joints suffer when you wear heels and they 're not great for your back either . In the long run , I suppose this might hurt your posture , but not immediatly .",1

"How would you explain the word , Elysium ? and what other words mean the same ? In Greek mythology , Elysium was a section of the Underworld ( the spelling Elysium is a Latinization of the Greek word Elysion ) . `` Elysium is an obscure and mysterious name that evolved from a designation of a place or person struck by lightning , enelysion , enelysios . ( Burkert 1985 p. 198 ) The Elysian fields , or sometimes Elysian plains , were the final resting place of the souls of the heroic and the virtuous . Two passages in Homer established for Greeks the nature of the Afterlife : the dreamed apparition of the dead Patroclus in the Iliad and the more daring boundary-breaking visit in Odyssey . Greek traditions concerning funerary ritual were reticent , but the Homeric examples encouraged other heroic visits , in the myth cycles accreted upon Theseus and upon Heracles ( Campbell 1948 ; Ruck and Staples 1994 ) .The Elysian Fields lay on the western margin of the earth , by the encircling stream of Oceanus ( Odyssey ) , and there the mortal relatives of the king of the gods were transported , without tasting death , to enjoy an immortality of bliss ( Odyssey book iv : 563 ) . Hesiod refers to the Isles of the Blessed ( makarôn nêsoi ) in the Western Ocean ( Works and Days ) . Pindar makes it a single Isle . Walter Burkert notes the connection with the motif of far-off Dilmun : `` Thus Achilles is transported to the White Isle and becomes the Ruler of the Black Sea , and Diomedes becomes the divine lord of an Adriatic island . '' ( Burkert 1985 , p. 198 ) .In Elysium were fields of the pale liliaceous asphodel , and poplars grew . There stood the gates that led to the house of Ais ( in Attic dialect `` Hades '' ) .",0

"Are you really offended by swearing ? Do you think profanity is stupid ? I do , I think it is the most superstitious bullshit ever . “ Oh noes , I have said a ‘ bad ’ word , someone is automatically offended ! ” Ridiculous . Anyway , what are your opinions on swearing ? Is it really that bad ? Does it really make people feel uncomfortable or is it just another word in the dictionary ? Is it limiting our rights to freedom of speech to not be able to swear on the radio or in settings like schools ? I personally dont get offended by them because they were always my second language . I do however think they can make a person sound extremely unintelligent when they use them simply for shock value . I think that as we mature though , it does seem to make you cringe when people curse with every other word out of their mouth . I can have a pretty dirty mouth when I get angry , or when I smash my thumb with a hammer or something- but in everyday conversation , whats the point ? Is it to sound `` cool ? '' I remember I used to do it for that reason when I was like 8 , but when the thrill wore off- it just seemed like those words really didnt have any real purpose for being in my sentances , but I didnt get offended by them- more like turned off I guess.If I meet someone and we are just having a conversation , and profanity takes up most of their conversation , I just think they are ignorant for the most part . I am used to it though , so sometimes the profanity seems more natural in certain situations.Taking Gods name in vain though , I think that is absolutely offensive because it is against the religious beliefs of many , whether you understand it or not- it does offend a lot of people.by the way , tranced- you didnt offend me either , you just gave me a bad impression of you . Your comments are ignorant because the truth is , if everyone believed in Jesus there wouldnt be any arguments , so the world wouldnt be so messed up . Like it or not its true , because if everyone believed in something moral - no matter what it is- we would all agree on that morality . So , to show you the ignorance in your statement- it is ridiculous to blame Christians for the worlds troubles when the worlds troubles are rooted in things that go AGAINST Christian belief ! Sometimes a little reason- goes a long way , no matter what your beliefs are .",0

No one plan to Nuke the US specially Iranian , there are more Irani people in US than you can imagine , just go check your best universities like MIT or Stanford.The only attack to US has done by Bin Laden and if you know he was created by CIA in order to prevent Afghanestan to have a government like Iran and Iranian supported Anti Taliban groups in Afghanestan all the time that US was supporting them , and Iran government yelled that he is a murderer , its not Iranian fault.US do n't like Iran to be a nuclear power , its a fact but you must search the reason elsewhere , its not hollywood movies , its politics.A nuclear Iran will ruin all power equations in Middle East . Even they can force US to leave the territory . That 's the real reason.Iran has threatened Israel to wipe out of the map for 30 years and nothing actually has happened and will not happen.The main use of Nuke is n't military , its political , look at India and Pakistan , they declared they are both have nukes at the same time . they both have it but it was hidden , when one did a nuclear test the other one did it about a week . Can you get my point ? About Iran and Israel there are many hidden facts that I 'm not in the mood to repeat ( if you really like to know them ask here or email me ) Anyways do n't worry , we will not nuke you , one who has to worry is me because once nice Americans attacked an Iranian AirBus which was full of civilan travelers and I 'm young and want to live long to see my grandchildren .",0
"what happens if an inmate doesnt die on the first try of the execution stage of a death sentance ? Execution is complete upon the death of the inmate .

The rationale being that he had served his sentence.. executed and pronounced dead.He could n't therefore be sentenced again for no man could be punished twice for the same offence and I believe its what we call 'double jeopardy'.Therefore , if you die and live after being executed ... you are a free man ... but is there such a chance ? : )",0

"M SECOND RIDDLE ? ? A rich man 's son was kidnapped . The ransom note told him to bring a valuable diamond to a phone booth in the middle of a public park . Plainclothes police officers surrounded the park , intending to follow the criminal or his messenger . The rich man arrived at the phone booth and followed instructions but the police were powerless to prevent the diamond from leaving the park and reaching the crafty villain.How did the kidnaper get away with the valuable diamond ? When the rich man reached the phone booth he found a pigeon in a cage . It had a message attached telling the man to put the diamond in a small bag which was around the pigeon 's neck and to release the bird . When the man did this the police were powerless to follow the bird as it returned across the city to its owner . Am I right ?",0
"Will Peja Stojakovic be a good fit in the Indiana Pacers line-up ? ? I 'm a big Peja fan , but he has really looked lost and uncomfortable this year . He had the reputation of being unable to deliver the big shot when it count , unlike Bibby . I wish Peja well and perhaps Larry Bird 's influence will put him in the elite category . Everyone was comparing Peja to Ray Allen as the best pure shooter , but in the clutch , Peja is more Lebron-esque ( King James , according to one statistic is like 2 for 13 lifetime with a shot to win or tie the game ) .",0

At our college , there are bike lockers , with individual locks .

Ask your councilor for a solution that works for you and the school . They are there to help you .",0

"War ? Why ? The real reason please . To force a way of life on the conqured ? Or for power and economic gain ? From the earliest history of humanity , war has always been about only two things - for power , and for resources , and many times it is for both - and many other times it is a war for power cloaked under a war for religion or resources . Hitler claimed he attacked poland for resources - he claimed he needed land for the German people , but that was really for his own power . Religious wars have been fought and are fought for power . For the power that those at the top of religion have over thier people . The best way to consolodate your power over your own people is to unify them against an enemy . That goes for political power as well as religious . The religious leaders of Europe fought the holy wars for thier own gains , claiming it was religious duty , however those at the top weilded the power over thier people by sending them to war . The warriors fought for god and religion , but those in power facilitated this . War will never go away because there will never be equity - someone will always have what someone else has . If by some miracle of technology , anyone can have anything , there will still be wars for power - power is the one thing that ca n't be fabricated . If you look at the current muslim extremists , they are not fighting for thier gods , they are fighting for power , and indirectly for resources . They want to create a muslim world , where they will have the power , and by having the power , they will get the resources . If you look at the heart of any conflict , you 'll see it - resources and power . Those are the core reasons for ANY war . However , since it takes two to make war . The Allies could n't stand aside while Hitler took over Europe and killed millions - wars are started by those who want resources and power , but are ended by people who fight for the defense of themselves and others . Wars are rarely started for honorable reasons , but they are often ended by honorable people , who sacrifice themselves to stop the greedy , the evil , and the powerhungry . However , sometimes , those who fight the evil and powerhungry have dishonorable motives of thier own , but they can claim the moral highground because they did n't start the war , and they will benefit from defeating the ones who started it , and maybe because they destroyed a greater evil , it is accepted . Sometimes you have to trade a great evil for a lesser evil.This also goes for society on the small scale as well - Christians claim homosexuals are evil sinners in order to strengthen thier own group - any group gets stronger with a common enemy . There is no better way to facilitate group cohesion , and this group cohesion in this case leads to even more power for those at the top . Life is a power struggle .",0

"Does anyone know the easiest and quickest way to tell if any number is prime ? Going through possible factors is n't practical , and can take forever , so that 's not a viable choice . Also , any prime number has to end in 1 , 3 , 7 , or 9 , because otherwise it 's not prime . ( Even numbers are divisible by 2 and 5 just means it 's divisible by 5 ) I just had a math packet dealing with this topic . There are many equations out there that deal with finding primes , but all so far fail at a certain point in the sequence . The method you refer to , called the Sieve of Eratosthenes , was developed by its namesake in Greece sometime between the 500s and 350 B.C . and is so far the only proven method to find primes .

"What is the easiest way to get a college degree on the net ? Is n't an easy way to do it , in fact , for some people it is more difficult to get an online degree than a traditional classroom based degree . You need a lot of self-discipline , high reading ability , and motivation to do a lot of learning on your own to do an online program . The only part of an online program that people view as `` easier '' is that you are n't necessarily tied down to a particular time of day to do your work . So , if you are a night owl you can do all your work at night , for example.That said , if you are interested in an online degree then you should seek a degree from a school that also has an established classroom based degree program . Recognize that many people still have a stigma toward internet degrees , so having a degree from an established college/university will lessen the stigma . Hope this helps .",0

"What should one do to gain respect in society and also for himself ? plz answer other than- `` give respect take respect '' I think it could be a mistake to `` gain respect in society . '' Society can screw itself . If you `` need '' society 's respect , they have power over you . Do you want to be in that situation ? ? ? ? Only you can truly know if you are worthy of respect . Whether they in society respond to you with respect can sometimes be in error . Some of the most respected people , say in a corporate work situation , are complete idiots -- not worthy of any respect at all , yet they are shown respect for all the wrong reasons . And who in society do you want respect from ? If you want respect from hip-hop rappers , then get some gold teeth , grab your crotch liberally , and wear pants that are falling to your knees . If you want respect from slimy salesmen , go work at a car dealership and make the most bonus of any person that week ... .Do you want respect from people in the local church ? That works great until you disagree with one of their beleifs ... ... ... The most important thing is that you become a person who respects himself -- regardless of others . That is truly of value . If you are looking for respect as a commodity , to be used as a tool for getting stuff from people , then I poo-poo it.So you need to define what qualities in yourself are worthy of respect . Curb the habits and things about you that you do n't respect , or accept that some things will never change and you are who you are . It will be a mix of both -- each of us is different , so you might as well embrace it .",0

"how to concentrate a UV light to a coherent light ? this question does n't make sense ( it 's incoherent HAH ! sorry.. corny joke . ) light from a light bulb is called incoherent light because it 's made up of many different waves . waves as you know have a property called phase , which tells you where along the wave-front you are at a given position and time . incoherent light is a mixture of light waves with random phases.coherent light on the other hand , is used to describe light where all of the waves have the same phase - so the waves peak and trough at exactly the same time and position . coherent light is much more intense than incoherent light because all of the phase fronts add up constructively , and so you end up with a very large amplitude wave.so , if you `` concentrate '' UV light , by using a lens or some other sort of focusing device , it will be more intense than the spread-out light , but it wo n't be coherent . the only way to get coherent light is at the source - for instance , an excimer laser can be tuned to emit in the ultraviolet , and the light will be coherent . there is no ( known ) way to convert incoherent light into coherent light , though that 's not to say it 's impossible - such a thing just has n't been invented .",0

When a person says `` I 'm dating Bill '' instead of `` Bill is my boyfriend '' , you can probably guess the relationship is relatively new and no commitment has been made . When you 've decided you 're in a relationship , you 'll probably start referring to one another as boyfriend/girlfriend . You 'll introduce each other to your close friends and family . You 'll likely spend a LOT of time together , and may take it for granted that you 'll see each other certain nights and weekends . Depending on your lifestyle , you may agree to make your relationship exclusive and stop seeing other people.If you 're uncomfortable discussing taking things to `` the next level '' you 're probably just dating , and not quite ready for a relationship .",0

"i need info on thighroid cancer . My sister has this cancer and is getting the runaround from the doctor ? Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer . Thyroid cancer is a cancerous tumor or growth located within the thyroid gland . Thyroid cancer is one of the few cancers that has increased in incidence rates over the past several years . Its incidence has increased by about 3 % per 100,000 people per year . The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 25,690 new cases of thyroid cancer in the U.S. in 2005 . Of these new cases , about 19,190 will occur in women and about 6,500 will occur in men . About 1,490 people ( 860 women and 630 men ) will die of thyroid cancer in 2005 . Many patients , especially in the early stages of thyroid cancer , do not experience symptoms . However , as the cancer develops , symptoms can include a lump or nodule in the front of the neck , hoarseness or difficulty speaking , swollen lymph nodes , difficulty swallowing or breathing , and pain in the throat or neck . There are several types of thyroid cancer : papillary , follicular , medullary , anaplastic , and variants . Papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas are referred to as well-differentiated thyroid cancer and account for 80–90 % of all thyroid cancers . Variants include tall cell , insular , columnar , and Hurthle cell . Their treatment and management are similar . If detected early , most papillary and follicular thyroid cancer can be treated successfully.Medullary thyroid carcinoma ( MTC ) accounts for 5-10 % of all thyroid cancers.Medullary cancer is easier to treat and control if found before it spreads to other parts of the body . There are two types of medullary thyroid cancer : sporadic and familial . Genetic testing ( of the RET proto-oncogene should be performed in all patients with MTC to determine whether there are genetic changes that predict the development of MTC . In individuals with these genetic changes , removal of the thyroid during childhood has a high probability of being curative.Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is the least common and accounts for only 1–2 % of all thyroid cancer . This type is difficult to control and treat because it is a very aggressive type of thyroid cancer.Treatments for thyroid cancer include surgery , radioactive iodine treatment , external beam radiation therapy , and chemotherapy . In most cases , patients undergo surgery to remove most of the thyroid gland , and are treated with thyroid hormone replacement therapy . For those with papillary and follicular thyroid cancer , the dose of thyroid hormone replacement is usually high enough to suppress thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) well below the range that is normal for someone not diagnosed with thyroid cancer , to help prevent the growth of cancer cells while providing essential thyroid hormone to the body . Factors associated with thyroid cancer include a family history of thyroid cancer , gender ( women have a higher incidence of thyroid cancer ) , age ( the majority of cases occur in people over 40 , although thyroid cancer affects all age groups from children through seniors ) , and prior exposure of the thyroid gland to radiation . While the prognosis for most thyroid cancer patients is very good , the rate of recurrence can be up to 30 % , and recurrences can occur even decades after the initial diagnosis . Therefore , it is important that patients get regular follow-up examinations to detect whether the cancer has re-emerged . Monitoring should continue throughout the patient ’ s lifetime . Periodic follow-up examinations can include a review of the medical history together with selected blood tests appropriate for the type of cancer and stage of treatment ( TSH , thyroglobulin , CEA , and calcitonin levels ) , physical examination , and imaging techniques ( ultrasound , radioiodine whole body scan , chest X-ray , CT , MRI , PET , and other tests ) .",0

"What are the chances that a verbally abusive man can change overnight , and keep the new changes ? My husband has been an active duty military man since we met . He started out as caring , loving , and patient . After we were married , he became dis-trusting , accusational , and just down-right mean . After he pushed me into asking for a divorce , he showed up out of the blue from base to `` prove '' taht he would and could drop everything for me . He 's been real sweet ever since . A far cry from who I have known for the pst year and a half ! I have been through this same thing you are going through . ( My husband is active duty in the military too BTW ) When he got nice all of a sudden it was because he was having an affair . So I do n't think he will keep the new changes .

"Where can I learn all about the basics of credit cards ? i know almost nothing about them except that you use them to pay for things . i want to know first the basics , and then strategies to avoid having bad credit ( i dont have any credit yet ) . I 've been searching all over , but the websites i find are always using terms and acronyms that i 'm not sure i know the meaning of . can someone help me out ? I agree with VaTreasures - the best thing you can do when using a credit card is to discipline yourself to pay off your balance on time . If you get into a habit of not paying on time you start to acrue more and more interest fees ( I know all about it ) . Paying back on time will also avoid any missed payment penalties.Apply for a credit card with an interest free period , this will cut down on costs . Getting an interest free period is important.If you are unhappy with the idea of running a credit account , then I would recommend a prepaid card or direct debit card . Prepaid cards can be loaded with funds so you can not overspend , which keeps your finances in good shape . Debit cards withdraw funds from your bank account instantly when you make a purchase , again these do not require managing a credit account and help discipline your spending.More helpful tips from round the web :",0

"Are pheromones found in human beings ? Humans have one or more pheromones ( originally called `` exaltolides '' ) , presumed to exist for some years , but formally accepted to exist in 1986 . They are strongest in women during the time period around ovulation and work subliminally ( at concentrations too small to recognize as an odor ) . They are responsible for women who live together , as in a dorm , synchronizing their ovulatory cycles . Men emit some at a regular rate , but the importance of this is not understood . At stronger concentrations these pheromones have a musky , even offensive , smell - thus the prevalence of musk-type perfumes trying to mimic the effect . It is the buildup of exaltolides in the air that may cause the heightened social activities in everybody at a crowded cocktail party or a dance . The increased body temperature from physical activity will increase evaporation into the air .",0

I think not so , since increasing the pressure constantly would also raise his internal pressure . But the question is , HOW much pressure ?

"Should NiCADS get hot when they are in use ? ( NOT WHEN CHARGING ) ? When using a Modified 6V nicad ( use to be 4.8V ) it becomes very hot..probly about +70C . the system it drives is designed to automatically shut down when supply voltage drops ( Unsure what to ) reciently tested and found the drop from the 6V was as followsFully Charged = 7.55VShut down voltage = 5.89VHowever i have not modified the system in which it is used for so how is it that it is shutting down before the standard nicad voltage of 4.8V ? Have placed the Nicad in the freezer to see if dropping the temperature will allow me to re use the nicad in the system . Please help electronics ar n't my thing NiCads in general electronic applications are typically designed to NOT get hot , since the heat destroys the NiCad battery , can damage electronics and causes lawsuits when users get burned from the hot battery . Some devices like radio-controlled cars are high-drain applications that generate a lot of heat , so the batteries for these devices are designed for their specific use.Batteries get hot when they charge due to the high current going into them . The faster they charge , typically the hotter they get . When the battery discharges during use , the same thing happens , the battery gets hotter as more current is drawn from the battery . Without knowing anything else , my guess is that high current draw from the battery cells is causing them to heat up . This can be due to a defective battery , a battery not designed for the way you are using it or your modification damaged the battery or is otherwise causing excessive current drain.Also , increasing the supply voltage can drive more current through the device , so it may just be that the higher voltage is drawing more current.I ’ m not sure how the device is shutting down , so I can ’ t say why it ’ s doing that . Note that the voltage at which a device stops working is the voltage seen by the device itself . If you remove the battery from the device and measure the voltage , you will get a different voltage than if you measure the voltage at the precise moment the device shuts down . This is especially true for high current drain applications , which appears to be what ’ s happening with your batteries . Placing the NiCad ’ s in the freezer wo n't help . They ’ ll have to warm up to work properly anyway .",0

"Wht are the reqs for becoming a licensed psychiatrist in Florida ? Do you need a PhD or do you just need certification ? I 've just started looking into this as a career option & am sort of lost as to what to do or where to go for some complete answers . My intent , if at all possible , is to attend an online college , such as Capella . Thanks for the help ! In order to be a psychiatrist you need to attend an tradtional college/university and earn a BA or BS . Then you need to make sure that you have the required prerequisite classes for medical school which is inorganic chemistry I and II , organic chemistry I and II , physics I and II , biology I and II , 6-9 gredit hours of english/ english lit.. And some schools require that an applicant has calculus and 3-9 hours of behavioral sciences . And do n't forget to take the MCAT , have good recommendations , maybe volunteer at a hospital etc.. Then apply to medical school in which you will earn either a MD or DO depending on what program you want to be in . ( A psychiatrist has earned either an MD or DO . ) After you graduate from medical school , you need to enter a psychiatry residency ( I do n't know how long the residency program lasts , maybe 2-3 years ? ) . But , if you want to be a psychologist , you still need a BA or BS and then go to gradtuate school for psychology and earn a PhD . Be careful not to confuse a psychiatrist with a psychologist . A psychiatrist is a medical doctor ( M.D . or D.O . ) who writes out prescriptions and decides whether physical and mental disorders are from physical or psychological origins . A psychologist , however , is a doctor of philosophy ( Ph.D ) or a doctor of psychology ( Psy.D ) . Those are not medical degrees , and a psychologist can not prescribe medicine . But in order to become either one , you need to earn a B.A or B.S . first and have very good grades .",0

"can the government really do illegal actions ? for instence ... can the gov . really lie to the public about different things like terrist acts and catasraphies . iv heard theorise that 9/11 didnt happen by commersial airplains and by types of gov . airplanes and that the CIA kidnapes terrorists and takes them to different countries where they have no laws and torchers them and things like that ? dont worry . this information is from reliable sourses which is why i wounder about this . Of course , various individuals within the American government , as well as larger entities within the government have gotten away with crimes . Check out the story of Ruby Ridge . Sara Weaver war murdered by FBI agent Leon Horiuchi 's sniper fire , as she stood on the doorstep with baby in her arms . The FBI also murdered one of her sons and killed the family dog . The government had to pay Randy Weaver 1.5 million dollars for this fiasco , but the government murderer Leon Horiuchi could never be prosecuted . Similar events happened at the government massacre of innocent civilians at the Branch Davidian church at Waco , Texas . Attorney General Janet Reno and ultimately Bill Clinton , were responsible for those murders , but they and all under them were never prosecuted . Our founders knew that government was a beast which would always grow in power and corruption and tyranny , unless seriously counterpoised by an armed and freedom loving people . Thomas Jefferson said the tree of liberty must be watered from time to time by the blood of patriots and the blood of tyrants . Our second amendment rights and inalienable God given rights to keep and bear arms , has been continually eroded by unconstitutional antigun laws . The people have been brainwashed by the government propaganda centers ( public schools ) that the government is our saviour , and that our rights come from the government , not from God , as the Declaration of Independence so clearly stated . Check out JPFO ( Jews for the Preservation of Firearm Ownership , Aaron Zelman 's group ) , which is the strongest gun rights group . The NRA is nothing but compromising antigun hypocrites.Alex Jones and some others believe that 911 was a conspiracy by the illuminati . Hard to tell . But certainly , if passengers on board those airlines had been able to exercise their constitutional right to keep and bear arms , such a thing could n't have happened . I will not fly if I ca n't take my gun . I will not be subjected to unconstitutional searches getting on the plane like some slave dog . I am a free american . The Patriot Act and similar legislation shows that the government is far more interested in using 911 and similar incidents to attack our rights , rather than to go after the enemy .",0

It is just a polite greeting . I used to be offended when people would ask me where I was going , when I was in Malaysia . Then I realized it was just the polite greeting for their culture . If , for instance , someone was going to rob a bank , they would not say so . You have probably seen people on crutches greeted with `` how are you ?

"how to grade elementary papers ? Your question is kind of open-ended . It truly depends on the grade . I work in kindergarten and use just a brightly colored marker to make smiley face on it if it is entirely correct . If there is a mistake , I circle it and write oops ... and ask the child in person to fix it . I NEVER write negative comments in kindergarten so as not to discourage children . If you were looking at an older grade ( 3-6 ) a more definitive grade out of 100 points for example works easier for you and them . The parents and students can begin to gauge an approximate grade for the quarter and you can calculate one much easier . It also gives your final grades a basis to stand on.Whatever you decide , make sure you have the information to back up your final grades for the student.Stamps , stickers and smileys are popular but just make sure it does n't take away from the really great thing about the paper - the student 's accomplishment and hard work !",0

"How are North and South America considered one continent , but Europe and Asia are considered seperate ? This question ( http : //answers.yahoo.com/question/index ? qid=1006020706083 ) inspired my question . I was always taught that there are seven continents . I personally would consider Eurpoe and Asia to be united before I would ever consider North and South America to be united . If you think otherwise ( or if you agree with me ) , please explain your answer . All 7 continents were joined together billions of years ago . However through time , they gradually split up , resulting in North and South America , and Australia to be separate from the main body-Europe , Asia and Africa.I figured because Europe and Asia had different coloured people which each had their unique tradition and customs . As they ruled differently due to customs , tradition and prctices , they probably decided to each govern their own way and thus they spilt up into 'different continents ' , though Europe and Asia are on the same piece of land .",0

"If we can be baptised by the holy spirit , do we need to be baptised by water ?

The absence of water baptism does not disqualify one from entering into the Kingdom of heaven , in example ; the thief on the cross goes to paridise without water baptism or for that matter without the baptism of the holy spirit ( since Jesus is not dead as a man yet ) Jesus does command us to get baptized in water as a symbol for expressing an inward change by showing an outward appearance .",0

In the 14th century , a south Indian dynasty seized power in the north and established a Tamil kingdom . Occupied by the Portuguese in the 16th century and by the Dutch in the 17th century , the island was ceded to the British in 1796 , became a crown colony in 1802 , and was united under British rule by 1815 . As Ceylon , it became independent in 1948 ; its name was changed to Sri Lanka in 1972 . Tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil separatists erupted into war in 1983 . Tens of thousands have died in an ethnic conflict that continues to fester . After two decades of fighting , the government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam formalized a cease-fire in February 2002 , with Norway brokering peace negotiations .",0

I am a young actor as well . I highly recommend reading AUDITION by Michael Shurtleff . 1 . Speak at a good pace and be LOUD ( little to no chance of landing the part if they ca n't hear you ) 2 . Do n't memorize anything unless you have to . It will not impress the person casting if you can memorize something . Memorizing unnecessarily wastes energy on remembering when it could be used towards acting.3 . Be respectful and attentive to the auditor but DO NOT MAKE SMALL TALK WITH THE AUDITOR . They are there to work.4 . Get familiar with the play so you can be more prepared to accuratly portray your piece . 5 . Practice , Practice , Practice . Practice in front of people ( and get feedback ) , practice to a mirror.6 . If memorization is necessary , memorize it like the back of your hand . Once you get on stage and the adrenaline starts pumping , it 's easier to forget.7 . RELAX , the auditor is not out to get you .",0
"What are the basic differences that separate Roman Catholicism and Protestantism ? I think a major difference is that Protestants believe that you can not get to heaven on your own merit , that you must confess your sins and trust in Jesus as God 's son who died as a sacrifice for your sins ; they believe that you can not avoid sin on your own , that you must rely on Jesus as a redeemer , but that you will want to do good works out of appreciation for God 's salvation through Jesus . I think that Roman Catholics believe that you must acknowledge that Jesus is God 's son , but also that you have to do good works to get to heaven.From what I understand , Protestants believe that you can/should directly ask Jesus to forgive your sins , while Roman Catholics believe that you can/should confess your sins to a priest , who will in turn be your `` intercessor '' to Jesus/God . Also , Protestants believe that only Jesus/God/Holy Spirit are holy and that the Virgin Mary ( Jesus ' mother ) or other `` saints '' are just regular people , saved by God 's grace/Jesus . Roman Catholics believe that the Virgin Mary and other `` saints '' are holy , and can be prayed to for miracles or forgiveness.For the most part , I think that Protestants believe that when you die , you will go to heaven or hell . Roman Catholics believe that you might go to purgatory ( where you are `` purged '' of your sins before you get into heaven ) . I think there 's also `` Limbo , '' which is a place where babies can go if they have n't been able to comprehend the choice between heaven and hell.There are , of course , a lot of different divisions within Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths , so a lot of these are generalizations , and will not necessarily apply to a Protesant or Roman Catholic person 's personal beliefs .",0
"how do i score a 750+ + score for the GMAT ? Which courses , books etc should I use ? The GMAT is essentially a glorified SAT - all the stuff in there you definitely learned pre-college . I 've never been a big proponent of the GMAT classes because I feel you can get everything out of the book . The class is n't going to teach you some random formula you do n't already know . Both the books and classes essentially spell out what format of questions will be asked in each section . Then they drill you on that format repeatedly until solving for that type of equation or that grammatical structure is second nature no matter what weird way they ask it on the test . I would recommend getting one of the books , Kaplan is pretty much the industry standard . Read it all the way through . Then take every practice test in the book , then save a few bucks and go hang out in the bookstore and take a half a dozen practice tests in other GMAT prep books . Review every question on your test you got wrong and go back into the book to see what “ format ” of question it is and review that again . Then use the free CDROM that should come with your prep book to focus in on any sections you are bombing on the practice tests . This worked for me and one of my buddies . We studied for about two weeks for an average of 3 hours a day and topped out over 750 . The MCAT would be another story…thank god I don ’ t want to be a doctor…",0

"why would a wife rather run with male friends than to spend time with her husband and family ? I have always worked hard and the jobs took me away from home alot . The last one I was mobilized to Iraq . Of which I was sent back home early due to a child custody problem . My wife had ( by power of attorney ) custody of my children from another woman . That woman showed up to the house and now I am here . Once all the military crap was completed and I was discharged from active duty , We had spoke about allof the above and she had stated that she felt confined . That she had no friends anymore . I tild her that she could go out with friends every once in awhile . That ended up to be every night m-th at a bar until it closed and f-sa at one ( a males ) house to play cards . For the most part I believe as such was going on , , , but now how can a male friend of hers who understands why I would chase after to find my wife and ask her to come home and not stay out all the time allow her to move in with him with our children.. ? ? ? It sounds like she has no respect for you and has no consideration for your feelings . Why would you want to be with a woman like this ? Would she be so understanding if you were spending your free time with another woman ? You need to take charge of the situation and put your foot down let her know that this is unacceptable behavior and if she refuses to put a stop to it you know that she is not the one for you . Ultimately the decision is yours do you want to live this way and if she is not looking out for your childrens best interest than maybe you need to .",0

"If Catholıc are donatıng a huge amount of money to charıtıes , why there always a NEWS of HUNGER ın the world Not all charities deal with hunger . The catholic church is a frequent location for the donations . The church has numerous employees at every church as well as support staff at the diocese level and at the Vatican . Most of these staff members are salaried while the Priests & etc have most of their expenses paid for through these donations . The staff members are to be treated like members of any business and receive pension and health care adding additional costs . Other costs that individual churches have include heating and cooling costs . If you think your heating bills are bad , think of a large building with lots of windows and doors frequently being opened.The church itself has numerous missions besides just feeding the hungry . Frequently churches have nurses on staff to visit the elderly home bound and others who may need help in administering special medication and can not afford nursing homes or a onsite nurse . There are frequently nuns on paid staff that visit the ill , the dying , etc . Some churches have other ministries as well depending on the local area . Catholics are also big on right to life and spend considerable resources attempting to deny people 's right to choose . They are also suppose to be opposed to the death penalty and also working against the archaic penalty but is nomally the work of a few individuals.All of these different things I have mentioned are just a few of the items that the church works on as well as hunger . That being said , Catholics are individuals and also give to other charities that they have personal interests in . From cancer research to colleges , it all stretches the dollar even further.Everywhere I have been , the protestants have tended to have much more open pocketbooks . It may have something to do with the silly notion that catholics have that every sperm is sacred and thus have more kids . The point is , everyone overlooks the most needy , not just Catholics .",0

I 'll be using the notebook for internet and typing papers . Thanks guys ! ! ! I work on an HP Compaq NC6000 that work supplied me and I like it . I 've had it over a year . It 's been reliable and fast . My wife has owned a Toshiba for over three years.I surf the internet , play music on it , write technical papers , send e-mails , write programs , and run numerical analyses on it.Battery life could be better . I can only go for about an hour and a half before the battery depletes.If you are going to be taking notes in classes , you may want to get two batteries for it so you can get several hours of uptime without connecting to a power supply.The rest of it ... Gigahertz , Pentium , Celeron , AMD really does n't matter these days . Almost any laptop will play DVDs ( with a DVD player ) , CDs , etc plenty fast.In fact , the lower the Gigahertz ( the clock rate which at which the processor ( AMD or Intel ) ticks along ) , the longer your batter life may be . Slowest Gigahertz you should go with is about 1.5GHz.I would make sure that the notebook has at least 512MB of memory , preferably 1GB . This is important if you run several programs at once ( e-mail , internet , music player , and word processor ) . If you do n't , things can slow down and wear down battery life faster as data is moved on and off disk.I would go with a 15 '' LCD . 17 '' is better if you are at your desk all the time , but if you are carrying the thing around a lot , the smaller display makes for a more compact laptop . To each his own.Any brand-name laptop ( HP , Dell , IBM , Toshiba ) should do well to meet your requirements .",0

"Why does society treat us as a unisex ? According to biological studies men and women are different in physical makeup , hormones , and even brain activity . According to psychological studies men and women have different wants , needs , and desires . Where some are the same they often have different priority levels.So , why does western culture treat us as a unisex ? That we are all supposed to be the same and teats down people who accept those distinct difference ? Western culture treats us as equal because of the ERA , womens rights movements , and feminist groups that demand equality . Unfortunately , there seems to be an either/or side-effect . We are either unisex beings with no differences , or we become stereotypes of man/woman . There is no middle ground yet because the politically correct crowd is afraid of stepping on toes .",0
"Ice to Steam ? Calculate the amount of heat ( in kJ ) needed to change 59.90 g ice at -17.87 oC to steam at 250.7 oC . ( Some constants for H2O : Heat of fusion : 333 J/g ; Heat of vaporization : 2260 J/g ; Specific heats : Ice : 2.1 J/g.K , Water : 4.2 J/g.K , Steam : 2.0 J/g.K ) Note : I 'm going to convert all the intermediate steps into kJ by dividing by 1000 . I wo n't show that step . First , let 's find out how much heat it 'll take to get the ice from -17.87 degrees to zero degrees , where it has to be in order to melt . This is a change of 17.87 degrees . ( Because one degree Celsius and one Kelvin is the same size degree , they are interchangable . ) We 'll use the specific heat capacity of ice . 59.90 g ice * ( 2.1 J/g*K ) * ( 17.87 K ) =2248 J = 2.248 kJNext , let 's find out how much energy it would take to melt that ice at 0 degrees to water at 0 degrees using the heat of fusion:59.90 g ice * ( 333 J/g ) =19950 J = 19.95 kJNext , let 's find out how much energy it would take to get the water from 0 to 100 degrees ( so it can become steam ) using the specific heat of water:59.90 g water * ( 4.2 J/g*K ) * ( 100 . K ) =25160 J = 25.16 kJNext , let 's find out how much energy it would take to evaporate the water using the heat of vaporization : 59.90 g water* ( 2260 J/g ) =135400J = 135.4 kJFinally , let 's find out how much energy it would take to get the steam from 100 to 250.7 degrees for a total change of 150.7 ; we will use the specific heat capacity of steam:59.90 g steam* ( 2.0 J/g*K ) * ( 150.7 K ) =18050 J= 18.05 kJ . Now , just add up all of the heats required at each of these steps : 2.248 kJ+19.95 kJ+25.16 kJ+135.4 kJ+18.05 kJ=200.8 kJ , with correct significant figures .",0

"does outter space ever end ? ? The best guess today : no.In modern cosmology the topology of the universe appears to be open . `` Topology '' meaning the shape , although in the case of the universe to observe the shape we would have to exist in 4 spatial dimensions . Since we 're stuck in 3-dimensions we have to get by on analogies.The topology or shape of the universe is something which comes out of Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity . It depends primarily on the distribution of mass and energy in the universe . If the amount of mass-energy is more than a certain critical value then the universe would be `` closed . '' Basically the mass would curve space-time back onto itself . In a closed universe you could fly off in the direction of the north pole and ( after about 25 billion years ) and circle the universe to land on the south pole.If the amount of mass in the universe is less than this critical value then the topology of the universe is a bit more complex , but , to answer your question space would be infinite.Based on what we know today that is the case , space is infinite.However , we can not see an infinite universe . When we see things that are farther away we also see them from deeped in the past . A galaxy we see that is 10 billion light years distant is actually a view of what the galaxy looked like 10 billion years in the past.When we look farther in space , and thus earlier in the history of the universe , we eventually run into the microwave background . For the first 10,000 years or so after the Big Bang the universe was so dense that it was n't yet transparent . When the density dropped enough to be transparent then some of the light could escape for us to detect much later.However , while the universe is thought to be about 13 billion years old , we can actually see out a bit farther than that , I think around 20 billion light years , because the universe is expanding.What this boils down to is that there is a sort of `` wall '' beyond which we ca n't see . This wall corresponds to a time soon after the Big Bang . However , studies of the total mass-energy within the universe strongly suggest that it has an open topology - that it is infinite . ( Of course it is possible that this infinity will be refined when we have a better theory of how Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity play togther . String Theory is one way to combine these two . )",0

"What kind of lies did the Ku Klux Klan tell ? An why did people go along with it for so long ? There are so many articles about the Klu Klux Klan that it boggles the mind . In a nutshell they - like Nazi Germany - beleived that the white race was omnipotent and that all other races are/were subservient or corrupt in some manner . Therefore they agreed that by process of elimination , they would rule as the all powerful white race . This misguided belief was fueled in part by the rife prejudices in the southern parts of the US . Since they beleived that blacks and other races were not in their white power plan , and these races were no better than dogs and should be treated as such , they proceeded with a process called culling . This is where they mistakenly thought that they could rule society and that everyone would go along with their beliefs . They used the bible and twisted its teachings to enforce their beliefs . A lot of people went along with it , in part , because of the slavery and its abolition in later years , but also because it was the `` Christian '' thing to do . Some thought that if they were true christians they had to go along with it , because they beleived the words of the Grand wizard . The Klu Klux Klan was a secret society for a long time .

"* ... .Sigh ... .* ? why are we so ignorant to life ? why is it that so many of us glorify our ignorance instead of realizing the real necessities of life ? You might find this an ambigious question , but thats the point ... .. Humans have a tendency to glorify their personal ignorance . Those of us in the United States seem to excel at this . He are taught a little morals in our childhoods and believe that we are righteous . We learn how to barely read and write and think that we are educated . We become aware of a few emotions and feel that we are mature and experienced.The best that you , personally , can do is to stop comparing others to yourself and just work on YOU . The other have their own problems . You need to work on your instead of judging them . If you are lucky and get your own poop together , then others will come to you to ask how to get out of their own ignorance.Wipe your own nose and butt . Let the others do the same , in ignorance or not .",0
"What exactly is a black hole ? A blackhole is a collection of matter with gravity so immense that nothing can escape how strong the pull of it is unless when you are in it 's pull you can accelerate faster than the speed of light and beyond , thus the blackhole swallows up light as well.What happens is large masses collapse under their own weight . Think of a house of cards . The more you pile on , the greater the weight becomes until the cards on the bottom ca n't take the weight anymore . When the house of cards falls , the cards still exist but have lost their structure do to gravity.Now instead of a house of cards , replace that with an enormous sun that has tons of matter inside . The sun is teetering on the brink of collapsing as the matter inside grows and grows until eventually , like the house of cards , it falls down . Except since this is a sphere in space is is being pulled inward by it 's onw gravity , and not down like earth gravity , the sun does n't fall down , it falls IN.When this does happen the gravity does n't stop existing because the matter does n't either , it becomes smaller and the gravity grows as it pulls larger and larger amounts of matter into it 's core . Eventually it because so dense and so massive and so small that the gravity involved will not allow even Photons , or light particles , the fastest thing in the universe to pass through it.There ya have it !",0

"Why was an embargo put on Cuba ? `` When , on January 7 , 1959 , Fidel Castro assumed control of Cuba after President Fulgencio Batista fled on December 31 , the U.S. government initially supported the Cuban Revolution , formally recognizing the new government . However , relations rapidly deteriorated when the new Cuban government passed the first Agrarian Reform Law to begin expropriation of large-scale ( largely American-owned ) land holdings on May 17 , 1959 . The compensation offered ( based on 20-year bonds at 4.5 % interest for the tax-assessed value ) was seen as inadequate , and was rejected by American interests . Animosity escalated with the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis . After that , the U.S. promised never to invade Cuba again , but resorted to financial measures instead . `` This embargo initially caused damage to the Cuban economy , but 45 years later , has very little effect . This is why many ( aside from GW Bush ) have called for lifting the embargo .",0

"Does my mom hate me ? Their are four kids in our family . My mom treats me and my oldest sister like we are slaves . My other sister and brother , she praises for cleaning up their own messes . I clean the house she says I missed a spot , looks at me like I 'm stupid and does it herself .

I have to work hard but my grades are as good as hers , when my grades come in the mail it gets looked over and passed on to me . No word said about my good grades .

"How do I tell if my wife 's affair went further than the internet and casual meetings ? She has been meeting with this coworker after meetings and IM each other . I found the emails nothing bad , but a Blog of my wife saying he 's all she can think about at meetings and wondering if he would leave his wife for her how hot he is ect.. My wife says it was just a crush and nothing physical . I 'm not sure this is the truth , since she lied about everything else , until I found out for myself . Lying is part of the Affair . First print a hard copy of the BLog , and all Emails for future referance . Chances are it has gone farther and she is covering it up . The only way to get through the lies is to catch her in the act . I suggest you contact a private investagetor to look into the matter , They have knowledge and resourses that you would not have , plus by having a third party you get honest information and not biased based on how you feel . Now if you learn that she is not cheating , `` yet '' then I suggest you work on the relationship before she does . I would suggest you seek help in counciling . Your not going to be able to resolve the issue by yourself . She is looking at other men probably due to an unmet `` NEED '' at home . You can read books like those listed below to help identify what those needs are , but until you begin meeting the `` NEED '' your self , and expose the lies you have no chance of saving the marriage .",0

"When is the best time to go to disney world ? This is my response to a similar question : This depends on what you are looking for as far as the best time . Christmas time is one of the most beautiful times of the year . Each resort is decorated for Christmas and the decorations are beautiful . If you go during this time you have to visit the resorts . They have a carousel made out of chocolate , a a very large gingerbread house and other amazing things . Plus , the christmas trees are beautiful as well . Also , the whether is nicer . Usually it will run in the low 70s during the day . If you are near the water it is a little cold and windy , but not too bad . Also , the parades in the park are themed for Christmas and very nice to see . However , if you have never been to Disney , you may want to see the regular parades . The crowds can be bad , but I have gone several times during Christmas and it is a great time of the year to go . I highly recommend staying away from the time around July 4 . During this time almost all of the parks will close due to capacity . So lines are extremely long and it is terrible to try to get around . Also , it is very hard . Combine the large crowds and the heat and it can be misserable . You will not have as much fun if it is this hot and crowded as you would otherwise . however , the fireworks during this time are spectacular and will not dissapoint . But you have to wait a long time in order to see them from a good location.I usually prefer going after school has started . September/October is a great time . The weather is nice , crowds are n't and big as the other times of the year . If you go in value season you can save yourself some money . Keep in mind , Disney will often do refurbishments during this time because it is not as busy , so some attractions may be closed while you are there . But it easy to find this out ahead of time . Also , if you go in October you can go to Mickey 's not so scary halloween . This is a must see if you go during this time . The park is closed early that day and you have to have another ticket to get in . But there is a fraction of the people in the park . There are rides open and you basically walk right on . It is nice to be there when it is n't as busy and it is really neat as well . Plus , if you have kids , it is more kid friendly than the Universal Halloween party.So you need to think about what you prefer and then take your vacation at that time of year .",0

Even then , and assuming a mediocre economy , it would pay a good percentage of the pension amounts for the next 50 years or so.I am afraid that the hype about its demise was fostered by an administration that wants to get rid of it and support a plan that will be enormously profitable for brokers and financial advisers , among others .

"Does anyone know who William Tyndale was ? Info from Wikipedia : William Tyndale ( sometimes spelled Tindale ) ( ca.1484 - October 6 , 1536 ) was a 16th century priest and scholar who translated the Bible into the Early Modern English of his day . Although numerous partial and complete English translations had been made from the 7th century onward , Tyndale 's was the first to take advantage of the new medium of print , which allowed for its wide distribution . Later , in October 1536 , he was killed by strangulation and then burned at the stake.Much of Tyndale 's works eventually found its way to the King James Version , which , though the work of 54 independent scholars , is based primarily on Tyndale 's translations.For more information follow this link : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tyndale",0

"Where can I find an inexpensive but accurate hygrometer ? I want to be able to calibrate it and I need to spend under $ 50 . Nice question , most people unless they are weather buffs or cigar afficianados do n't know about hygrometers.Hygrometers measure relative humidity , or how damp or dry the air is.There are digital and analog hygrometers.Calibration ( adjusting for accuracy ) of both is difficult for various reasons . To calibrate a hygrometer means you need an accurate reference which provides accurate relative humidities over a range of air temperatures and pressures . It is not enough to calibrate a hygrometer at just one point . Most analog ( dial ) hygrometers only allow you to set one point by twiddling the fixed dial until the needle is pointing to the current moisture level.Most inexpensive digital hygrometers do not have calibration controls . The next price level up only allow you to set offset and scale - this is so-called `` linear calibration '' and it is not much better really.Depending on what you are measuring , one of the easiest ways to make your own accurate hygrometer is with two accurate but inexpensive lab thermometers . See the link on how to make a wet bulb hygrometer.Cheap hygrometers are easy to find on auction sites like ebay or yahoo , and using Googles Froogle search .",0

But I worry about what people in other countries think about Americans when he speaks for us with that dumb redneck voice . He was not elected by the majority of Americans . We chose Al Gore . The supreme court appointed him president . In the 2004 election he did'nt win any primary elections . The repulicans did'nt let anyone challenge him . They made believe they were democrats and voted for Kerry , and the democrats were saddled with an unelectable candidate . Then they put a gay marrige thing on the ballot so people would go to the polls to vote against that , and voted for the more anti gay candidate while they were there . In the 2000 election Gore won the popular vote , i.e . the majority voted for gore . In other countries you win if the majority votes for you . The foreigners dont believe that story about how Bush won because he got more of something called an electoral vote , especially since it happened in a state run by his brother . The election in Florida was done by computer , and everyone knows that a really good hacker can get into a computer and make it malfunction , so you know when theres something fishy going on with a computer , a hacker has made it past the firewall . Streamcat did'nt say concentration camp , he said temporary concentration camp , its a metaphor .

"why some people are gay ? I wish I could say I read Phillips answer , but I could n't maintain focus . So , risking repeating elements of his analysis , I 'm going to give this question a stab , but with a biological/evoluationary bent.Evolutionary arguments have been offered for male homosexuality . For example , Symons ( 1979 ) argues that homosexuality results from a meme that takes advantage of the inborn male propensity to find sexual variety interesting . Normally this propensity would be adaptive because it would encourage males to attempt sexual relations with many women , which would result in more offspring . But a meme could parasitize this propensity , redirecting sexual interest to non-adaptive objects , as in fetishism or homosexuality . Epigenetic arguments have been inspired by work on pre-natal hormones . Dîrner and his colleagues ( cited in LeVay 1994 ) link stress during pregnancy to hormonal effects on the fetus that would lead to homosexuality . This could be part of a mother 's adaptive reproductive strategy . That is , in times of stress , when it is difficult to raise children , it may be adaptive to have some homosexual children who could help their siblings raise offspring instead of having offspring of their own.Memic and epigenetic arguments may explain some aspects of homosexuality , such as the cultural variations in practices or identities , or specific behaviors of homosexuals ( femininity for example ) . However , the biological studies of homosexuality , together with the extraordinary cross-cultural similarities of exclusive homosexuals ( Whitam 1983 ) suggest that some aspects of homosexuality ( e.g . orientation ) are at least partly determined by genes.The basic problem for genetic explanations of homosexuality is to account for how a gene that does not lead to offspring could survive the pressures of natural selection . One possibility is that a maladaptive gene for homosexuality might re-occur repeatedly in a population if it results from the frequent mutation of a gene that is normally adaptive . However , people with maladaptive genes rarely exceed 1 % of the population , while male homosexuality apparently occurs much more frequently ( Whitam and Mathy 1986 ; Gadpaille 1980 ; Diamond 1993 ) . Another possibility is that a recessive gene for homosexuality might have advantages that allow it to pass on to future generations . For example , homosexuals could directly help their relatives ( who share the recessive gene ) raise more children . This `` kin selection '' hypothesis predicts more homosexuality in those societies where homosexuals could most help their relatives ( for example , in endogamous societies where homosexuals would live nearby ) . Nevertheless , cross-cultural research shows that this is not the case ( Werner 1979 ) . Another possibility is that a homosexual gene itself , when combined with non-homosexual genes , may provide reproductive advantages . This latter scenario is sometimes known as the `` heterozygous '' hypothesis , although it is really about any type of gene combination ( LeVay 1994 ; Sommer 1990 ) . The heterozygous argument suggests that homosexuality results from genes for submissive behavior . An animal possessing only submissive genes would fail to reproduce for lack of trying . But an animal possessing only genes for dominance would also fail to reproduce because it would get killed for taking too many risks . It is the `` heterozygous '' males , who would most likely pass on their genes . By the genetic laws of probability , this would leave every generation with a certain percentage of individuals at the extremes . For example , if each of a pair of chromosomes had only one `` homosexual '' locus with only two possible alleles ( one for dominance and one for submissiveness ) this would leave a heterozygous couple with 25 % of their offspring homozygous for submissiveness , 50 % heterozygous , and 25 % homozygous for dominance . If , however , homosexuality were the result of the interaction of five ge",0

"The End Times : Great Revival or Great Apostasy ? Many prophecies in mainstream Christianity have come out declaring a great influx ( revival ) of souls into the Kingdom of God before Jesus returns . Why then does Jesus declare : And then shall many be offended , and shall betray one another , and shall hate one another . And many false prophets shall rise , and shall deceive many . And because iniquity shall abound , the love of many shall wax cold . But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved . ( Matthew 24:10-13 ) And why would He ask : ... Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ? ( Luke 18:8 ) Just curious to hear others ' opinions ... 2 Thes . 2:1-3 ( NKJV ) Now , brethren , concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him , we ask you , [ 2 ] not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled , either by spirit or by word or by letter , as if from us , as though the day of Christ had come .

"Howard Stern : Are his radio broadcasts available through / on the internet ? Do not have access to his regular radio broadcasts or his proposed satellite broadcasts . Is there any way I can listen to his broadcasts / podcasts through the net ? Suggest a few sites . Howard Stern has been consistently hostile towards any effort to re-distribute any of his content on the Internet , for example contractually preventing affiliate radio stations from streaming on the Internet while airing The Howard Stern Show . When the show reaches Sirius satellite radio on January 9th 2006 , subscribers will be unable to listen to it through the Sirius web site.While a number of fans record the show and make copies available to download on a daily basis , either directly or via BitTorrent files , linking to any of these sources or downloading from them is tantamount to copyright infringement .

"Who invented the `` modem '' and when ? Tomlinson invented email in 1972.Digital modems developed from the need to transmit data for North American air defense during the 1950s . Modems were used to communicate data over the public switched telephone network or PSTN . Analog telephone circuits can only transmit signals that are within the frequency range of voice communication . A modem sends and recieves data between two computers . Modem stands for modulate/demodulate.In 1962 , the first commercial modem was manufactured - the Bell 103 by AT & T . The Bell 103 was also the first modem with full-duplex transmission , frequency-shift keying or FSK , and had a speed of 300 bits per second or 300 bauds.The 56K modem was invented by Dr. Brent Townshend in 1996.History of ModemsRobert Lucky invented the automatic adaptive equalizer in 1965 at Bell Laboratories.The Man behind the ModemsBrent Townshend , the man who dreamed up the idea for 56K bit/sec modems.Developer receives patent for PCM modemsBrent Townshend , the Quebec-based developer who worked on several core concepts for pulse-code modulated ( PCM ) modems , received several U.S. patents for that technology .",0

"how dies gravity really work ? Just to expand on the answer by `` twertyto '' , the answer to your question is `` We do n't know yet '' . This is one of the major questions in physics right now . There are some ideas but none of them have been proven either mathematically or in laboratory experiment . It is believed by most leading minds in physics that once we learn the exact relationship between gravity and the other known forces ( electromagnetic , strong nuclear and weak nuclear ) , we will then understand how gravity works . To understand this relationship will take what is called the `` grand unified theory '' , which is not yet a theory at all but a hoped-for theory to be developed in the near future . The `` grand unified theory '' would explain how gravity is related to mass and energy and the `` known forces '' mentioned above , and would do for gravity what Einstein 's `` E=MC2 '' ( relativity ) did for understanding the relationship between mass and energy . ( Some quick background : E=MC2 explained the exact relationship between mass and energy , showing they are both different aspects of the same thing , and can therefore be converted into each other ) . To sum this up in a simple fashion : scientists believe that gravity , energy , mass and even time are all made of the same `` stuff '' at some super-fundamental level , but they have n't yet figured out this fundamental level . Once someone does ( which would pretty much be a guaranteed Nobel prize ) , we will know how gravity works . Until then , we can only speculate .",0

"Why is this Alito guy such big news ? I 've been reading about this Alito guy but I do n't understand why is such big news . From what I understand he 's being interviewed for Judge of the Supreme Court . Is there a piece of information I 've missed ? Why is that such big news ? It just seems like a regular political process . It is a regular political process . True , the parties are bickering as usual , but there has always been controversy surrounding new Supreme Court justices . If everyone 's political party was swiched ( Bush would become a Democrat , for example ) , the exact same ranker would be going on . Justices are the top echelon of the legal system , so they are very important . Also , they are appointed for life , so you had better make sure you 're picking the right guy . Unfortunately , Mr. Alito is being confirmed during a particularly nasty period of political polarization , so many of the questions and issues are n't real questions , they 're sensationalist propaganda from both sides of the isle . In case you missed the memo , abortion is NOT the only legal question of the day , yet that seems to be what most of the fuss is about . Lastly , since they are appointed for life , this man has the potential power to influence American jurisprudential thought for perhaps the next 30 or 40 years . Needless to say , he 'll be making rulings long after Bush is gone , and the next guy , and the next guy . He 'll also survive Republicans losing their majority in Congress , then gaining it , then losing it , etc . So essentially , theres a big fuss because they are getting ready to install someone who is going to effecting law ( and by extention politics ) for many years to come . I personally think the Court will be fine with Alito because , unlike the talking heads on CNN and FoxNews who seem fixated on abortion and other trivial matters , I 've been watching the hearings live and reading the transcripts ( I 'm a law student ) , and he actually seems less polarizingly conservative and more qualified than even Republicans are admitting to .",0

"Why is Curling a sport much less and Olympic event ? Seriously ... .Curling ? ... My Brother in law ( who I love very much ) is a big , burly biker who co-owns a strip bar ... .and NASCAR , foootball and yes.. loves Curling ... .I do n't get it ... . I think because anything classified as a sporting event it requires a certain degree of athleticism , skill , practice , dedication , and ( in the case of team sports ) team-work ; add in an opportunity to test your levels against others to find out who is best and you have a sporting event ( you mentioned NASCAR in your question details ... driving a car in a big circle for a couple of hours does n't require much athleticism either , but it is still considered a sport , right ? ) Now why it is considered an Olympic event ... well , it is a sport with growing popularity in many countries that participate in the Olympics ( Canada , many of the northern European countries , and a growing fan-base in the northern United States ) , and the Olympics have been a fairground for countries to show off new and/or unusual sporting events from around the world ( Ice Dancing ... the poor-man 's figure skating OR `` I 'm just doing this until Disney-on-Ice calls me in for an interview ! '' ) . Some of the events catch on and become world-wide phenomenons , others fizzle and die. < Added > I added athleticism to the list of skills needed because there is a degree of athleticism to curling that you do n't find in other strategy games ( chess , for example ) . I mean , watch the curlers in the Olympics . They are running around on ICE for Pete 's sake ! Any time I step on ice I fall on my ... personality ... but these guys are running up and down the ice as if they were walking in the grass ! And it is n't just the shoes they wear .

"Why do white men like asian chicks so much ? This is probably not the first time you come across this phenomenon . These days , you see a great number of white men wanting to be with asian chicks other than gals of other races . What qualities about asian chicks that white men like about ? Why do asian chicks want to be with white men ? An input from both male and female would be good ! Men believe ( rightly or wrongly ) that an Asian girl will be more submissive or docile . They stereotype Asian women in that way based upon what they see in movies or based upon what they hear goes on in Asia . Some Asian women are attracted to white men because they want someone who does n't treat them as subserviant . They want to be treated as an equal . See what can go wrong in this picture ? Obviously many relationships between Asians and westerners work just fine , but if someone is just trying to attract `` any Asian '' or `` any white guy '' , there could be a problem . As far as physical attraction , perhaps some are attracted by the more youthful appearance , but some may also be attracted by the fact that in general , Asians tend to be slimmer than western women . Many guys find that attractive . Guys look at a woman 's mother for a clue at what his girl may look like in the future . Asian parents tend to be slimmer than western parents . There is some male input for you .",0

"interfaith marriage ? How can a devoted Catholic woman overcome restrictions in the bible ( which she believes in ) to marry a non-Christian ? I suppose today 's society is n't as tribal as the past societies or the ones you still see in 3rd world countries where women were nothing but chattel.Based on that it 's quite simple today to find someone you love having most of the qualities you desire - yes , even in the religious sense.A devout Catholic women should be chaste and so must her husband . Both should have a pure state of mind and believe in God.There are many non-Christians who are n't Christians or Catholics but still have a sense of God , but are not ready to make a huge commitment to the Christian or Catholic faith if they 're not ready yet.Many non-Christians are chaste , have pure , good hearts and I 'm sure we all know not all Christians are better than non-Christians . I 've met alot of non-Christians with hearts of gold that 'd put many hollow-faithed and judgemental Christians to great shame if they were put together.It maybe a matter of time before this person actually decides to take God and Christ into his or her heart , or through the spouse 's good conduct and deep faith , decide that , yes , the children are better off having a religion then just skulking around in the wide open space looking for something.So , I do n't think we should judge non-Christians harshly - unless as individuals they have less-than-honourable conduct and character . It takes a lot of love , effort , acceptance and faith in God , as well as time , for the spouse to realise that yes , I want to accept Christ in my life.And of course , when the children come their religious beliefs will form naturally in the family .",0

"Why do electrical outlets have 2 different sized sockets ? Wall sockets have AC voltages , so there is no positive and negative . One of the two prongs has what is called `` Hot '' , and the other is called `` Neutral '' . The Neutral is connected to ground back at a distribution center , while the Hot is 110 Volts AC ( in the U.S. ) . By the time it gets to your home , the Neutral is not quite ground anymore , but is still relatively safe- wheras the Hot is quite dangerous and potentially deadly.Some appliances are designed to have extra protection between the Hot and people . For example , a light socket has the 'threads ' ( the easily touched part ) connected to Neutral . As another example , most appliances and the light switches disconnect the Hot when they are off.The different sizes of the sockets prevent you from plugging an applicance in backwords . If you did this , then the switch would disconnect the Neutral instead , and leave the Hot on- making the device less safe .",0
"why was the square deal so important ? During the 1904 campaign , Roosevelt called his actions in the coal miners ' strike a `` square deal '' for both labor and capital , a term that stuck to his administration . Roosevelt was not the first president to take a stand for labor , but he was the first to bring opposing sides in a labor dispute to the White House to settle it . He was the first to threaten to seize a major industry , and he was the first to appoint a commission whose decision both sides agreed to accept . `` Let the watchwords of all our people be the old familiar watchwords of honesty , decency , fair-dealing , and commonsense . '' ... `` We must treat each man on his worth and merits as a man . We must see that each is given a square deal , because he is entitled to no more and should receive no less . '' ... `` The welfare of each of us is dependent fundamentally upon the welfare of all of us . '' —Roosevelt , New York State Fair , Syracuse , New York , September 7 , 1903 . The idea behind the Square Deal was to be fair to every citizen in the United States . To create this fairness , corporations and the average citizen had to be equal . To achieve this equality , President Roosevelt created a series of laws and programs aimed at rebalancing the balance of power between labor , consumer , and safety interests against business , manufacturers and profit.To ensure market competition , President Roosevelt built into the Square Deal program the concepts that monopolies were wrong and that business should not cut corners to the point where public health is jeopordized . When consumer buying power has no means to induce change via market competition , chances are the corporation would cut costs or corners to achieve a higher profit via deceptive practices , poor quality control , or polluting methods , at the expense of the consumers health or lives.So a square deal had to be instituted to ensure that business cost cutting measures have a limit . To achieve this goal , extreme cost cutting measures , wanton corruption and instability had to be brought under contol . Railroads were no longer allowed to give rebates or kickbacks to favored companies . Meat had to be processed safely with proper santitation , and people were allowed to breathe the fresh air of national parks . Foods and drugs could no longer be mislabeled , nor could consumers be delierately misled to make a profit . Businesses were forced to accept the additional cost of these reforms as a part of the their cost of doing business .",0

"Does the government have the right to order private internet companies to provide user 's search records ? Lately both Yahoo and Google where served a court ordered to hand over to the government some search records regarding porn Some good answers here . I 'll take a stab at it myself , though I do n't know anything about the incidents other than what the original poster included in his question.First , we 're talking about illegal pornography . `` Regular '' porn , the kind that is n't illegal depending on whoever 's standards we 're using , is n't going to be subject to a search warrant because it is n't a crime ... and search warrants can only be issued when they seek to provide evidence of a public offense ( a crime ) . So whatever porn we 're talking about , it 's evidently illegal according to whatever legal standard is being used ( and this varies , but things like kiddy porn are illegal everywhere in the US ) . Once the illegality has been established , then I do n't think there 's much left to talk about ... you can not hide behind a right to privacy if you are engaging in criminal behavior . That 's not to say you give up your right to privacy , it 's to say that if you 're engaging in criminal acts , the government has the right to ask a judge for a search warrant to gather evidence of those acts , and I would argue that you can not complain about your privacy being `` invaded '' when they do.And a word about search warrants ; they are not rubber-stamped documents that sail through the justice system to your front door . Law enforcement agents must prepare an application for them , outlining reasons to believe a particular place holds evidence of a particular crime . They must swear the things they 've said in that document are true , and then they must present the document to a neutral party - a magistrate ( or a judge ) . That magistrate ( or judge ) then reviews the information provided by the agent , and decides on his/her own if there is a more than likely chance ( i.e. , `` probable cause '' ) that the things the agents are looking for are in the places the agents say they are . Despite the rare news to the contrary , magistrates and law enforcement alike take this process seriously.About the `` third party '' argument made by the original poster : again - if you 're engaging in criminal behavior , you can not expect to hide behind the right to privacy just because you 've given the evidence of your guilt to a third party . The government has the right under our system of law to gather evidence of your criminal behavior , no matter where you have left it.If you want to deliver evidence of your involvement in criminal acts to a third party , press on ... and you do so at your own risk , obviously . The original poster 's comment is well taken ; if your third party is going to comply with an order of a court to disclose certain information relative to criminal acts , then perhaps you need to find another third party - one who will become a criminal themselves if they fail to comply with a lawful court order.Yahoo and Google have not betrayed anyone 's trust ... although it 's been a while since I 've seen them , I 'm fairly certain both corporations have privacy policies , and I 'm equally certain both of them talk about safeguarding your information except when ordered to release it pursuant to a court order . If the third party thing bothers you , do n't use a third party ... there 's a saying : `` three can keep a secret , if two are dead . '' Do n't want anybody to know what you 're doing ? Do n't tell anybody .",0

Also download the songs/files with the most users sharing that file . Lastly its not entirley the viruses that are the problem , those arent really as damaging anymore .

"Why is it that RICH Americans walk free from a trial but POOR ones go to jail or to Death Row ? Actually , the percentage of celebraties that walk is about the same as the percentage of 'poor ' people who walk . Conviction rates at trial used to be over 90 % , the rates have been falling and in some major metropolitan areas are down in the 65 % - 70 % range . The big differences are ( 1 ) the big celeb trials make the papers and ( 2 ) 80 to 90 % of the 'poor ' plea guilty to something and do not go to trial.The two big celeb trials , OJ and Blakely are especially unique in that the juries were stupid , stupid , stupid . And in the OJ case , at least , the DAs were incredibly inept . Of course , it was not the jurors fault that they were stupid . They were picked because each one claimed to have no opinion , which meant they had no connection to current events . In the OJ case they also had to be locked up in a hotel for the duration , which meant that the jurors had either no jobs or dead end jobs and no family or social life . Further , with the massive publicity and cameras all around , the jurors got the idea that they were really in a TV show , such as Law & Order or CSI , where the obvious suspect is never the real criminal and all loose ends are tied up before the credits roll . A real trial , like real life ends up with loose ends , and 99 % of the time the obvious suspect did do it .",0

If you were born on US soil ( definitions of this can be complex , but it certainly includes all US States , Puerto Rico , etc ) , you acquired US citizenship at the time of birth under jus solis . you can check the source below for more information . If you are abroad , you can contact the local Embassy of Consulate of the nation you are interested in for information . Otherwise , you would normally refer to the local office of your country 's agency for handling citizenship , usually the Ministry of Internal Affairs , Home Ministry or Foreign Ministry.If you were born to at least one parent who was a US citizen at the time of your birth , you may be a US citzen under jus sangre . To determine this , check the source I list below . Your parent will have had to meet certain residency requirements and determination can only be made by factors such as your birthdate , which of parents is a citizen , and how long they may have resided in the US.Disclaimer : taking advice from a person using Bubba as a screen name could be hazardous for your health .

I firmly believe that true service would help most people , lower unemployment ( military training translates to outside employment ) , and lessen the `` gim me , gim me , gim me a handout '' crap that is very widespread .

Why should people squeeze money from the Fed for schooling , when they can earn that benefit by serving in the armed forces ?",0
"do fish drink water ? Web research seems to indicate that most fish do drink plenty of water , some continuously . Some fish absorb water through their skin and/or gills , and may excrete water that way , too . Apparently , fish need to maintain a fairly high concentration of salt , so how a fish deals with this need depends on whether it is a saltwater or freshwater fish . Most saltwater fish get enough or too much salt , and so preventing water loss is their concern . Freshwater fish are short on salt , and since water dilutes sodium , they have many mechanisms for excreting water . It is interesting to note that kidneys process water for excretion , so some saltwater fish have dysfunctional kidneys or are missing kidneys to help prevent water loss . The four `` water/salt '' strategies are listed below : -- -- -- Admin Note : The problem with fish vs. watery environment has do with the process of osmosis , defined as 'net movement of water molecules through a semipermeable membrane from a dilute solution to a more concentrated solution . The 'membrane ' is the 'skin ' or any other part of the fish that separates it from the water . If the concentration of salts and other solutes in the fish is greater than the outside , watery world , the fish takes on water ( natural attempt to 'dilute the fish to what it 's like outside ' - bad for the fish ) . In scientific terms the fish is hypertonic to its surroundings ( freshwater fish , e.g. ) . If a fish is hypotonic to its environment ( marine fish ) , then the seawater has a higher solute concentration than the fish ; the fish loses water to its surroundings ( also bad for the fish ) . Kidneys function to overcome the effects of osmosis so fishX can stay either more or less concentrated than its environment. -- -- --",0

We stop caring about how precious life is . How God gave us the air we breathe and the ability to be creative and work towards building relationships with others and with God our creator . When we become greedy we lose out because our whole life is spent grabbing wealth so we can get ahead . Ahead for what ? New house , more cars , more hedonistic pleasures to fulfill the emptiness we really feel inside . The Bible says , `` money is the root of all evil . '' When you look around at all the evil in the world it most likely can be traced back to greed . We ca n't take it with us when we go . We came into the world naked and we 'll go out that way . Think about it ! What 's important ? I plan on spending eternity in Heaven with my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ ! You are right that the Bible says that Money is the root of all Evil and you cant take it with you ! People shouldnt take for granted that they are going to be here tomorrow..b/c NONE of us are Promised tomorrow or even the next minute or second . Take the time to Thank GOD when you open your eyes and you can put your feet on the floor ! And for those ppl who are lost and dont have Jesus Christ , Do n't keep putting it off to accept him into your life , b/c like I said NONE OF US are PROMISED the next sec , minute or tomorrow ! And I 'm sure you do n't want to burn for eternity ! GOD BLESS all of YOU ! With love in the LORD , ME !",0

"How 's apoptosis related to the development of the fingers ? the way apoptosis make the fingers form ( scroll to `` > > > > > > '' ) For every cell , there is a time to live and a time to die . There are two ways in which cells die : They are killed by injurious agents . They are induced to commit suicide.Death by injuryCells that are damaged by injury , such as by mechanical damage exposure to toxic chemicalsundergo a characteristic series of changes : They ( and their organelles like mitochondria ) swell ( because the ability of the plasma membrane to control the passage of ions and water is disrupted ) . The cell contents leak out , leading to inflammation of surrounding tissues.Death by suicideCells that are induced to commit suicide : shrink ; develop bubble-like blebs on their surface ; have the chromatin ( DNA and protein ) in their nucleus degraded ; have their mitochondria break down with the release of cytochrome c ; break into small , membrane-wrapped , fragments . The phospholipid phosphatidylserine , which is normally hidden within the plasma membrane , is exposed on the surface . This is bound by receptors on phagocytic cells like macrophages and dendritic cells which then engulf the cell fragments . The phagocytic cells secrete cytokines that inhibit inflammation ( e.g. , IL-10 and TGF-β ) The pattern of events in death by suicide is so orderly that the process is often called programmed cell death or PCD . The cellular machinery of programmed cell death turns out to be as intrinsic to the cell as , say , mitosis . Programmed cell death is also called apoptosis.1 . Programmed cell death is as needed for proper development as mitosis is . Examples : The resorption of the tadpole tail at the time of its metamorphosis into a frog occurs by apoptosis . > > > > > > > > The formation of the fingers and toes of the fetus requires the removal , by apoptosis , of the tissue between them . The sloughing off of the inner lining of the uterus ( the endometrium ) at the start of menstruation occurs by apoptosis . The formation of the proper connections ( synapses ) between neurons in the brain requires that surplus cells be eliminated by apoptosis",0

"How do i get a government grant to research alternate forms of energy ? it depends on where you live . i assume you are in the US . there are several federal agencies that fund alternative energy research . the answer to your question largely depends on what kind of energy technology you are looking to research - wind , solar , biomass , fuel cells , whatever.you should check out this page : http : //www.eere.energy.gov/financing/ where you can learn about the federal grant process.you will probably have to write a grant proposal that outlines the merits of your research goals , an outline of the specific steps your research will take , your qualifications and why your project deserves funding . quite frankly , you will be competing with very highly-qualified , experienced and specialized researchers from universities and corporations , and unless you have an incredibly brilliant and specific idea , the scientific knowledge to make it happen and considerable money of your own to spend ( the grants typically only cover part of the cost of the research - the researcher 's institution or other grants are supposed to cover the rest ) ... then you can expect to be weeded out very early on.have heart though ! if you 're just a guy with an idea who likes to tinker in his basement or whatever , they offer a program for you ! called the inventions and innovation program : http : //www.eere.energy.gov/inventions/ it 's geared for small projects and independent research . do n't expect to get much , but if you have a good idea you may be lucky . other government agencies can possibly provide grants , too . consider the national science foundation ( http : //www.nsf.gov/ ) or the national renewable energy laboratory ( NREL ) ( http : //www.nrel.gov/ ) for other grant options.good luck !",0
"do clouds freeze ? if clouds are like water , why do n't they ? and if they do , why do n't they like fall and shatter .

However , the cloud always remains water vapor untill that time.If there were no winds , ect , or the winds were not that strong , then the clouds would all freeze , and you would have huge mile or more long blocks of ice falling from the sky : )",0

They say divorce is like death . The processes of grieving are very similar . The only difference is that the one that you love is still alive and kicking . Take this time to examin what you want out of life . Appreciate this time alone and do things that you could not do when you were married . Enjoy the lack of nagging and complaining . And enjoy that you can act as you did before you got married . Time heals all wounds and with this time , you have the ultimate chance to reexamine your goals and proiriities in life . Take it one step at a time and you will be fine . I know the pain that you are going through and I know that it hurts .

"if its zero degrees and tommorow its going to be twice as cold how cold will it be ? So it depends on whether your question is in Fahrenheit or Centigrade ( aka Celsius ) . If it is in degrees Fahrenheit you need to convert to Rankine , divide by two , and then convert back to Fahrenheit:0 Fahrenheit = 459.67 Rankine ; twice as cold = 229.835 Rankine ; 229.835 Rankine = -229.835 Degrees Fahrenheit which is your answer.If , however , you are for some reason using metric , then you convert Centigrade ( Celsius ) to Kelvin , Divide by two , and convert back to Centigrade.So : 0 Centigrade = 275.15K ; twice as cold = 136.575K , converting back to centigrade you get -136.575 Centigrade which is your answer utilizing metric units .",0

"IS the freezing of water exothermic ? The guy above me does n't know what he 's talking about . He 's confused . Think about it : to freeze water , you need to take energy away from the water , right ? ( You lower the temperature , which is the same thing as taking energy away . Imagine sucking energy away from water to make it freeze . ) So , by definition , freezing water is exothermic . It gives off energy . Conversely , the melting of water is endothermic ; you need to give ice energy in order for it to melt . I know it can get confusing because when you touch ice , it 's cold , so you might think that freezing is endothermic , but it 's not . If you think about it , ice in your hand is taking away energy from your hand in order for it to melt ( that 's why it feels cold ) , so melting is endothermic , making freezing exothermic .",0

"Do You Belive th Entire Bible ? Do you belive in the entire bible , including Genisis ( not evolution ) , the New Testemant , and everything that God ( and Jesus ) says or commands ? Yes . But not the contorted , twisted , taken out of context versions that were edited to fit someones personal desires . Somethings in the bible dont quite sound right , but when you understand it and read the whole story of whats going on it all makes sense . Its like zooming out from just a few threads to see the big beautiful quilt . Its all interlinked and beautifully orchestrated . Its hard to see the whole thing when you focus just on a couple threads here and there.Faith is essential for belief.I find it neccessary to rebuke this blisschameleon , '' Evolution proves adam and eve wrong . '' Evolution is not proven . Also why are we not still evolving . The bible says God made each one according to its kind . `` And our knowledge of other solar stystems proves that there is n't just one sun in the entire universe . '' God has one Son , Jesus Christ . He made light and darkness . Please direct me to the scripture where you claim it says `` God made one sun , and one solar system . `` `` Humans traveling to space proves the tower of Babalon wrong . '' The destruction of Babylon was not over how far from the Earth the Babylonians were making themselves . It was about their attitude . Their wanting to build the tower to make themselves equal to God . Certainly this would not make it so , but it had nothing to do with a tower . `` Jesus ' story having similarities to osirus and Hercules.God condoning slavery , racism , sexism , violence ... revenge in some scriptures and disaproving them in other scriptures . '' God is the author of all things . My dear chameleon , you have failed to grasp the concept . God does not condone these things . He allows us to make decisions which results in our sin . You have failed to understand what is going on in the Bible . You are so far from the truth . Sexism ? ? ? ? ! ! ! Come on , did you even read the Bible ? Women are to be submissive to their husbands , yes . But there is even greater responsibility from the husbands to the wives . And I am not sure you understand the sort of submission God is conveying here .",0

I am an avid theatre arts performer , and while taking performance classes there were quite a few individuals with accents . One in particular was a girl from russia , while in the class I seen her accent decrease dramatically . The reason the class helped her is because before we start our lessons we would do tongue twisters , while keeping our diction ( which means that you have to speak as clearly as possible without dropping off the end of any words or smushing the words together ) . Try some of these tongue twisters : The blue black bug bit the big brown bear , and the big brown bear bled blood.You know New York you need New York , you know you need unique New York.Red leather yellow leather , blue black metal copper kettleChrysanthimum Geranium Alluminum Linoleum-x3Say them as clearly as possible , and find new ones regularly . If you start to say them with ease then it will no longer help you to lose the accent . I also have a friend that was born in England , and theatre classes have helped him a great deal as well also because of the tongue twisters . He also said that he would read the dictionary out loud . I hope I could help ! Thanks for the 2 points !",0

"what is your definition of myoelastic-aerodynamics ? ? ? Myoelastic-aerodynamic TheoryEarly voice researchers in the 1950 's and 1960 's explained vocal fold oscillation with the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory . According to these theories , Bernoulli forces ( negative pressure ) cause the vocal folds to be sucked together , creating a closed airspace below the glottis . Continued air pressure from the lungs builds up underneath the closed folds . Once this pressure becomes high enough , the folds are blown outward , thus opening the glottis and releasing a single 'puff ' of air . The lateral movement of the vocal folds continues until the natural elasticity of the tissue takes over , and the vocal folds move back to their original , closed position . Then , the cycle begins again . Each cycle produces a single small puff of air ; the sound of the human voice is nothing more than tens or hundreds of these small puffs of air being released every second and filtered by the vocal tract . Let 's further examine the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory . Myo- means muscle ; the vocal folds , after all , are mostly comprised of muscle tissue . The -elastic suffix serves to remind us that the vocal fold is elastic and that we have active control over its elastic properties . Aerodynamic means that the theory deals with the motion of air and other gaseous fluids , and with the forces active on bodies in motion ( such as the vocal folds ) in relation to such fluids .",0

"How can I be an influential leader in my work place ? How can I set standards and produce results daily ? As a guide to answers , I am actually a military officer employed as an Aide de Camp to the Governor General of Papua New Guinea , a representative of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and the British Monarchy.I am responsible security , protocol , leadership and administration of Government House ( the office of the GG of course ! ) A good leader defines the mission clearly for his troops and gets everyone to agree that the mission can be completed . When changes occur , then clarity and buy-in again play a huge role in success.Can you create an incentive for performance ? Can you measure performance ? Do n't reprimand someone in public . Do it privately . Do n't yell . Ask questions of your troops rather than constantly making statements . Figure out how to ask a question to achieve the same thing you could achieve if you gave an order . This , again , is buy-in . The best leaders assign the right work to the right person . The best leaders hire the right people for the right job and carefully cull the workforce for slackers.Do n't be too friendly with your suborinates , but make an environment where everyone would say you were friendly and professional .",0
"Problems with a relationship ? I 'm in my mid twenty 's and dating a guy twenty years older than me and he had said he really cared for me and then all the sudden he said it was n't working . But the next day he 's ready to try again and start all over . What would you do about that . The answer by vanessitacool is right on the money . This is a straight forward situation where you really need to walk away . But based on the background in your question , I sense that you may have a little trouble understanding why . So I will offer a little bit more.Consider that you may be only hearing what you want to hear . The fact that he said that he 'cared for you ' and that 'it was n't working ' . Sound contradictory when taken as sentence fragments , but in reality they are part of a much bigger communication context . I suspect that if you did n't just listen for what you want to hear , the message would sound alot more clear cut.Also when he says that he is ready to try again and start over , that may just be driven by some alterior motive ( sex ) . Men will say/do almost anything for that , and given that he is much older it is very conceivable that he is well versed in maniuplating younger more impressionable and vulnerable women.Do n't be a victim of these games . You deserve better .",0

"Why do women hate prenupts so much ? Marriage is about love , not finances . Prenps spell out terms that a divorce court would otherwise decide . Whe wealthier person usually requests a prenup of the less wealthy person before marriage , so usually the man requests of the woman . The prenup is usually drawn up by the lawyers of the wealther person and it tends to favor that person 's interests.The only reason the wealthier person would want a prenup is because they fear that they have more to lose in a divorce if they go through the court system , or they feel that they have a better negotiating position before the marriage starts than after it ends.This means that pretty much all the time the less wealthy person would fare better in divorce court then they would with a prenup.There are exceptions to this , such as wanting to protect some family heirloom or property that has been in someone 's family for hundreds of years or when the prenup is equally negotiated and each person has a thoroughly competent attorney with their interests in mind , but most of the time , the woman is asked to and does sign without counsel.I would say that women ( or the less wealthy person ) would object to a prenup for 2 reasons:1 ) They are bothered that the husband , his family , or his lawyers/staff are already thinking about divorce right before the marriage.2 ) They are upset that the husband wants to put the wife in a less favorable legal position should a divorce happen .",0

"do u think that lies saves u from bein ur self ? I do n't think I would use the word 'saves ' . I 'll ignore your grammar and spelling and whatnot and try to answer what I think you might be asking.To say that lies 'save ' you from being yourself implies that you do n't like who you are and that you think that the fabrications are better than reality . In fact , it 's the opposite . Lies , if you tell them often , do separate you from who you really are in that they are false , and provide the one you 're lying to with a false impression of you . They tend to amalgamate until you 're boxed in by your own stories . They start to add up and keeping them all straight is difficult , and there are almost always discrepancies . If you lie too much , it can make people hate you for deceiving them . If there 's something you do n't like about your life , so much as to lie about it , then I would suggest changing who you are instead . Fix it , and then you can be honest with everyone , yourself included.However , if you must lie , I would stay as absolutely close to the truth as possible . It makes them that much more believable .",0

"Is cheerleading a sport ? And if you do n't belive so , why not ? It really does get unfair sometimes that people do n't believe cheerleading is a sport . Cheerleaders have this bad reputation , but really , we 're nothing like that . If only people just knew how hard we work , and how much pressure we have on us , then they would believe it 's a sport . We work our asses off ! It 's a sport ! Get used to it ! ! Please find Heather Jeffries , M.P.A opinion here : Most cheerleaders say “ YES ” while state and school officials say “ no. ” According to the National Federation of High School Athletic Associations , seventeen to twenty states of the United States consider cheerleading a sport . Why is the question , “ Is cheerleading a sport ? ” such a controversial issue to anyone not involved with the sport ? According to MSN Encarta , the definition of sport is an individual or group competitive activity involving physical exertion or skill , governed by rules , and sometimes engaged in professionally . Because cheerleading follows every aspect defined under the word sport , it is my belief that cheerleading should be defined as an actual sport.The word cheerleader no longer means a sideline of squads that exist solely to support other sporting teams . Cheer teams are teams in their own right . College and high school cheer teams competefor national titles just as football , basketball , baseball , etc . Cheerleaders are recruited for college scholarships that have been known to exceed amounts awarded to other sports teams . Some cheer teams put in more hours in the gym than teams such as football and basketball . Cheerleaders have to be in just as good physical condition as any other sport participant.Cheerleading in the early years was nothing like the sport it is today . Over the past few decade cheerleading has evolved from leading audiences with simple arm movements to treacherous towers of humans and elaborate dances that are used to show the athleticism of cheerleaders . Cheerleading has developed from selections based on popularity to one that now claims some of the more talented athletes in the school/program.Cheerleaders are not seen as athletes , but seen as being athletic . Cheerleaders are very specialized athletes . Most do not understand the skill and athleticism required by cheerleading . The gymnastics ability , power and strength make cheerleaders some of the more wellrounded athletes in sports . Cheerleading not only teaches coordination and helps condition competitors , but it also teaches teamwork , leadership , communication skills , organizational skills , productivity and much more.Cheerleading contributes to the overall physical fitness of those involved . Many teams are in the gym four to six days a week working out , practicing , stretching and conditioning for upcoming performances or competitions . Running increases one ’ s lung power and endurance . Stretching , jumping , taking gymnastics and aerobics all help keep the body toned and healthy . So as you can see , cheerleading practice and workouts are much like those of other sports.When it comes to funding issues , the sport of cheerleading is not equally supported . Monies are contributed to sports that do not consistently perform well . Cheer teams that do perform well usually do not receive the monetary compensations for their performances . Scholarships , donations from alumni , and extra funding to the school rarely get distributed to the cheer programs . Programs known for winning national titles over several years occasionally receive monies . I believe this occurs only once the administration realizes the need to keep those athletes in their program . Cheerleading does not bring the revenue to schools like football games ; however , the publicity that some cheer teams contribute to the school can be profitable in other ways.As a former cheerleader myself , I remember having long and strenuous practices which seemed to last forever . Because my life was so into cheerleading , I did and still consider cheerleading a sport . I have always told people who I ’ ve talked to about cheerleading that I consider it to be a sport . After being exposed to the competitiveness of cheerleading , I stand stronger behind my beliefs in the sport of cheerleading.Being a co-owner and one of the head coaches for Clarksville Cheer Extreme , an all star cheerleading gym in Clarksville , Tenn",0

I do n't have a problem with that - as a United States citizen , I do n't mind the occasional exercise in patriotism.However , before it can be taught in schools ( if ever ) , there needs to be a consensus on how the concept is presented . The last thing I 'd want is some stereotypical militant white supremacist or some disenchanted cynic teaching the course or devising the curriculum.How 's *that* for a somewhat-less-than-concrete answer ? Truthfully , I hate any type of mind control methods , but we have the choice of whether or not to stay here - if we choose to stay , then we should exercise some loyalty and respect for the Constitution and the laws of the land . However , recognizing our freedoms includes speaking up when things are going wrong and need to be changed - being a true patriot means you want the bad things changed and not for anyone to be stuck with the `` America : love it or leave it '' idiocy .",0

"I want to become cricket umpire , please let me know how i have to start with . Thanks ? I am a professional and an avid follower of the game of cricket . I have this fascination to become a professional cricket umpire and I dream to become a member of the elite panel of umpires of ICC someday . I would like to know how to get started so as to be able to realise my dream . I am not at all aware about the procedure to be followed in this regard . Kindly guide me on the same . Introduction to international umpires and refereesOne of the ICC 's key priorities is to ensure that international umpires and referees perform at the highest standards possible . The ICC appoints the world 's best officials to the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires and Referees and provides an assessment and support system to aid umpires and referees in their development . The ICC has four officiating panels : • The Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires ; • The Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Referees ; • The Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires ; and• The ICC Associates and Affiliates Umpires Panel.The role of a cricket umpire is one of the hardest officiating tasks in international sport and sometimes calls are made for technology to play a greater role in cricket , but the ICC believes it is important not to override the basic philosophy that cricket is a game and human umpires are part of that game . The ICC is committed to trialing technological innovations but technology will only be introduced into the game if it : • can provide conclusive answers ; • is practical to introduce for all international cricket ; • does not compromise the role of on-field umpires ; and• does not change the essence in which the game is played.Becoming a member of the Emirates Elite and International Panel of ICC UmpiresTo become a member of the Emirates Elite or International Panels of ICC Umpires , officials must be standing regularly in first-class cricket in a Full Member country of the ICC.From the list of first-class umpires , each country nominates their two best-performing umpires to the Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires , and their next best to the position of TV Umpire.Members of the Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires are then eligible to be chosen for ICC events such as the ICC Cricket World Cup , ICC U/19 Cricket World Cup and the ICC Champions Trophy.They can also be appointed from time to time to stand in Test matches to provide cover for members of the Elite panel . The ICC closely monitors the performance of these umpires at international cricket . Those that show that they have the qualities to perform at the highest level , may then be invited to become full-time members of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires .",0
"who is Azazel in the Bible ? Azazel in LeviticusLeviticus 16:8 tells that the Lord ordered his high priest , Aaron , to 'place lots upon the two goats , one marked for the Lord and the other marked for Azazel ' on the Jewish Day of Atonement . The goat designated by lot for the Lord is to be used as a sin offering , while the goat designated for Azazel `` shall be left standing alive before the Lord , to make expiation with it and to send it off to the wilderness for Azazel . '' ( Lev 16:10 ) Aaron was to `` lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities and transgressions of the Israelites , whatever their sins , putting them on the head of the goat ; and it shall be sent off to the wilderness through a designated an . Thus the goat shall carry on it all their iniquities to an inaccessible region ; and the goat shall be set free in the wilderness . '' ( Lev 16:21-22 ) Leviticus also says that `` He who set the Azazel-goat free shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water ; after that he may reenter the camp . '' ( 16:26 ) From this passage in Leviticus , it would seem that Azazel is conceived of as a personal being , as lots were drawn for the Lord and for him . Also , Leviticus mentions that Azazel lives in the wilderness , as do the Se'irim . Because of this ritual , Azazel is known as the `` scapegoat . '' The goat that is sent to Azazel is not as a sacrifice , but as a symbol that there is no longer any unexpiated guilt . Both the goat and the man who leads away the goat are unclean , and the only way the man can reenter the camp is by washing his clothes and bathing . Azazel in the Apocalypse of AbrahamIn the Apocalypse of Abraham , Azazel is portrayed as an unclean bird which came down upon the sacrifice which Abraham prepared . This is in reference to Genesis 15:11 `` Birds of prey came down upon the carcasses , and Abram drove them away . '' `` And the unclean bird spoke to me and said , 'What are you doing , Abraham , on the holy heights , where no one eats of drinks , nor is there upon them food for men . But these all will be consumed by fire and ascend to the height , they will destroy you . ' And it came to pass when I saw the bird speaking I said this to the angel : 'What is this , my lord ? ' And he said , 'This is disgrace , this is Azazel ! ' And he said to him , 'Shame on you Azazel ! For Abraham 's portion is in heaven , and yours is on earth , for you have selected here , ( and ) become enamored of the dwelling place of your blemish . Therefore the Eternal Ruler , the Mighty One , has given you a dwelling on earth . Through you the all-evil spirit ( is ) a liar , and through you ( are ) wrath and trials on the generations of men who live impiously . '' - Apocalypse of Abraham 13:4-9The Apocalypse of Abraham also associates Azazel with Hell . Abraham says to him `` May you be the firebrand of the furnace of the earth ! Go , Azazel , into the untrodden parts of the earth . For your heritage is over those who are with you '' ( 14:5-6 ) There is also the idea that God 's heritage ( the created world ) is largely under the dominion of evil . It is `` shared with Azazel '' ( 20:5 ) Azazel is also identified with the serpent which tempted Eve . His form is described as a dragon with `` hands and feet like a man 's , on his back six wings on the right and six on the left . '' ( 23:7 ) Finally , the Apocalypse of Abraham says that the wicked will `` putrefy in the belly of the crafty worm Azazel , and be burned by the fire of Azazel 's tongue . '' ( 31:5 ) Here again , there is another reference to Azazel as being Hell .",0
"Heavy water what is the role that heavy water plays in the nuclear explosion process ? Heavy water is like regular water except that instead of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom ( H20 ) it has two deuterium atoms and an oxygen atom ( D20 ) . Deuterium is a hydrogen atom with an extra neutron.Water is used in nuclear reactors to moderate the reaction speed , and to absorb heat . Nuclear fission starts by giving off neutrons that create a chain reaction . Any water around it absorbs those neutrons ( becoming heavy water ) and slows the reaction . If heavy water is used instead of regular hydrogen water , the neutrons are not absorbed . This means that less pure nuclear material can be used to sustain a reaction . For example unrefined uranium , which is much less expensive , can be used instead of enriched uranium .",0

"I 've been deported once . It was my big mistake . But i really want to come back . Becouse i loved this country You will first need to apply for some type of immigrant or non-immigrant visa . Possibly you can be accepted into a university of some sort that will process your visa . If you have an employer who wants you to work for them , they might be willing to help you with a work visa or permanent residence . If you have an immediate family member in the US who is a resident or citizen , they can apply for you . Once that application is approved , you have to apply for a form I-212 permisson to reenter after deportation if you were deported less than five years ago .

"When did Standard Amnerican English evolve ? When did `` American English '' become the standard ? What `` English '' did the Founding Fathers speak ? ( British , American , a mixture ? ) Different dialects of English have different standards . Standard American English is the standard for many Americans , but British people have a different standard , and so forth . So American English is n't really the standard for everyone ( although it is for many if they have economic or cultural ties to the United States ) .As for how the standard evolved , there have always been standards . In general , the dialect of whoever 's in power is considered the standard , because people want to be like that powerful group . Americans who are trying to speak Standard American English do so because they think it will give them social power . What 's interesting , though , is that Standard American English is just agreed upon as the standard by many Americans even though it does n't belong to a particular region.The Founding Fathers spoke a dialect that is different from either American dialects or British dialects today .

"16 year difference in age - college teacher/ former student . How long before it ends ? I am curious as to other 's ideas . My ex-husband , a professional ethics prof , left me for one of his former students . She was then 20 , he 36 . We 's been married 13 years , together 15+ and it was very sudden . She knew he was married , and she was in lesbian relationship living with lover ; never been with man . Huge power differential , and she is still a student so he pays for all her living expenses in the apartment they share . She went from her female lovers place , where she dropped the bomb , to my ex 's new apartment in one day.Part of me feels that it was a mid-life crisis , but he invested so much he ca n't ever tell me so or apologize to me.Thoughts ? Know of similar prof/student relationships that worked long haul ? ? ? She could have been just struggling financially and looking for a sugar daddy . Or she might be serious about him , who knows . But even then they will be together for a while , but let 's say in ten years she will still be young and he ... not so much . She 'll end up leaving him for a younger guy too , which will serve him right . Ethics professor my a** !

"What is the best way to develop my piano technique to play pop/rock songs ? I know chords , inversions , etc. , but how do I make what I do with my left hand more interesting ( I tend to just play octaves ) ? Are there any good books/courses that you could recommend ? Well I just started learning jazz piano in the fall to accompany my singing . I actually learned some good rhythm patterns for the standards so far , I know they arent pop or rock songs , but it might help.Some suggestions : In the left hand you can play the root tone ( C7 it would be C ) and then the 5th note ( G ) alternating . So like on the first beat C and then on the 3 beat G. To make it more interesting play the C on the 1 and the 2.5 ( leading to the G ) and then the G on the 3 and 4.5 . ( I usually do that on swing songs , so you play the offbeats right before the next beat so it has that swing feel ) You play the chord in the right hand on the 1 and 3 . ( or in swing songs sometimes on the 1.5 or you play the chord on the 4.5 of the measure before ) Also for the left hand you can think of a bass line , which is a little more complicated . Where you play bass notes on each note according to the chord and you lead it to the next chord . I believe that the notes on 1 and 3 should be in the chord . Im not very good at that yet , so I cant really say much more about bass lines.For bossa ( or a latin feel ) , you play the left hand like my first example but in a straight feel . Then you play the chord in the right hand on the 1 ( 1/8note ) 2 ( dotted 1/4 ) 3+ ( 1/4note ) Another suggestions is to listen carefully to music you like and hear what they are playing . Try putting up the bass and figure out what they are playing exactly in the bass . Then analyze the chords , try playing along . It takes some time and effort but will help develop your hearing and make you a better musician . It might help to get an experienced musician to give you lessons . I would suggest going to jam sessions and finding a piano player you like and ask he/she if they would give you lessons . I really learned a lot in a short time with the help of guided lessons . ( I know some other patterns as well , but they are difficult to explain in a forum , it helps to see and hear them in person . )",0

"A force of 12N is applied to the handle of a screw driver being used to pry the lid off a paint can.. ? As the force moves through a distance of 0.3m , the screwdriver does 3.2 J of work on the lid . What is the EFFICIENCY of the screwdriver ? How did you figure that out.. i cant not figure it out so if anyone can and explain how they did it that would be great . Thanks . ok , all you have to do is figure out how much work it should have been doing , then compare it to the amount of work it actually did by using a percentage . so first of all , W=Fx ( work equals Force times distance ) that means that W= ( 12 ) ( .3 ) =3.6 J of work . Ok , so since it only did 3.2 J , that means .4J were lost somewhere . the efficiency is calculating the efficiency in terms of what percentage of the work that was actually applied was translated into the work energy that was done on the lid . the way you do this is just divide the amount of work it did by the amount of work it should have done ( in an ideal solution ) and then multiply by 100 in order to find the percentage of work it actually did in relation to the work it should have done . 3.2/3.6= .88889 ( x 100 ) = 88.89 % . so basically , in cases with efficiency , you divide the number you solved for by the number they gave you . a good way to figure out which you divide by which is just to randomly try dividing and if the answer is above 1 ( 100 % ) , that 's impossible so you switch them ; )",0

"How often should you get your well water tested ? We tested it over 8 years ago and it had some pesky little buggers in it so we ca n't drink it . The pump went bad and we fixed it and added clorox to the well like your supposed to . Do the organisms change over time ? Whether the organisms change over time depends on the origin of the microorganisms . If the contamination resulted from surface water intruding into the well , the conditions may have changed.Since you suspected the well water to cause allergic reactions , I 'd advise you have it tested on microorganisms again . The chlorox was added to the water after the pump , or to the bottom ? The intervals of microbiological testing depend on the amount of water you draw and the use you put the water to . If it gets into contact with food or cutlery , I 'd advise intervals of 3 to 5 years . If the chlorox treatment has rendered it drinkable , regular repeats are necessary , also in order to manage the dosage .",0

"Is there a dallas bias ? Do the Dallas Cowboys have a bias against them with the media in the rest of the country ? I do n't think that a bias necessarily exists within the media , but among fans I believe there sure are a lot of Cowboys haters . There are several reasons for this . For one , there is a little bit of jealousy for `` America 's Team '' . These feelings are still carrying over from their dynasty in the 90 's ( and even the 70s ) . Also , the organization has had many abrasive characters : owner Jerry Jones , the Tuna , ex-stars such as Michael Irvin , and the myriad of criminals and druggies they 've paraded through in the last 10/15 years . As with any great sports organization , fans are very polarized ... you either love 'em or hate 'em . I love 'em , but conversely I despise great competing teams such as the Steelers and 49ers . Some in the media may have their beef with Jerry Jones or other people in the organization , but I think the strong anti-Dallas emotion is mainly among the fans ( which is a tribute to the Cowboys being one of the top teams in the sport ) .",0

"im doing a project , does anyone know if Could a World Of Swimmers Raise The Sea Level ? ? ? ? ? plz answer ? I believe that you can simplify the problem with a few assumptions . First , it should not matter how deep the ocean is , raising sea level is a surface effect . Add a turkey to pots filled to the top with water and push it under and the same amount of water will spill regardless of how large the pots are . However , push the turkey under in partially filled pots and the level will rise more in a `` just right '' pot than one twice as large in surface area.Most people can just barely float or sink depending on fat content , so it is justified on average to assume a person will exactly displace their weight in water or their volume in water . Weight will be easier.You must select a size for the population and then calculate an averasge weight for babies , children , men and women . You could estimate the average weight of a typical family perhaps . You only need to show your calculations and reasons.Next you need to assume whether your population is swimming under water ( most displacement ) or with heads and arms above water ( least displacement ) . Most displacement under water will be easier , especially because some float better in salty sea water.Finally , you need to estimate the weight of the entire population and convert that to cubic feet of water where water weighs 62.4 lbs per cubic feet . Divide that by the square feet of surface area of all the oceans and seas and you will have the rise in sea level , to whatever decimal places you chose . Good luck .",0
"Is soul eternal ? why / how ? The `` soul '' is definitely NOT eternal . Look back in Genesis 2:7 at the creation of Adam . Note closely what it said : `` ... .and he became a living soul . '' It does n't say God GAVE him a soul , it said Adam WAS the soul . Later on in the scriptures ( Ezekiel 18:4 ) it says `` the soul that is sinning , it itself will die . '' The very notion of humans having some mysterious and separate soul that goes off somewhere at death is absurd , and completely against the Bible . Thank goodness we have God 's word the Bible to clear up such gross misconceptions and wrong beliefs .",0

"Shy and need help ? I am a shy person any suggestions on how to be more outgoing ? ? oasis , I have had this problem my entire life . I 'm in my 30 's now and am finally starting to get over the shyness . I still find it hard to talk to people I do n't know and to make friends . What I have found is that everyone else has insecurities just like me . Some people are just better at overcoming them.Some things I have found that work for me are going out with a best friend and some of her/his friends . That way you already know someone in the group and can gradually build relationships with the other members of the group . Go out and do something fun with them a few times so you can reminisce about those times to break the ice.I really have a tough time coming up with things to talk about with other people , so what I have done is read newspapers and magazines and watch TV that has interests like those of a person I am interested in getting to know . That way I have something to talk about . I never was one for meeting men . That is until one man at work caught my eye . We said polite hellos to each other , but that just was n't enough . I finally got up the nerve to talk to him . I walked right up , stuck out my hand , and said , `` I ca n't believe you have been here this long and I still do n't know your name . '' It impressed him that I was interested in him , and we began to talk and are now in a 2 1/2 year relationship . Sometimes you just have to get the courage to start . The other person will often take over once you make the first move . Smile , be yourself , and take a chance . You never know the great people you might meet !",0

"i 've seen alot of shoes left on the side of the street , some people say it 's a sign for some thing , what is it ? Some of the reasons for this which I have noted : Thieves drop stuff on the road they do not want and are trying to get rid of , often at night or early morning hours . I have even seen many boxes of very expensive cigars.Dogs play with shoes left outside or in trash.People who are drunk lose shoes.People who are struck by vehicle , sometimes shoe ( s ) come off.Stuff falls out/off vehicles while people are moving.Kids throw things out of cars.Some people throw things out of windows.Sometimes you see brand new boot or shoe , but seldom both left and right.Generally I think it is mostly a sign of carelessness and trashiness . Found in big city/environs much more than elsewhere.In Philadelphia I saw a huge difference between burroughs where there was a fine for littering and those where not.The trashiest city of all my extensive travels is Detroit , hands down the big winner.You can actually see people driving and flinging all fast food remnants and garbage out virtually any day . And lots of beer bottles 11pm -- 2am.So , I think it is trashiness and careless sign . In that regard it also reflects societal deterioration away from the desired norms of responsibility , care and cleanliness.The best solution is more of the latter . But that is also difficult to enforce . Nevertheless , I am for at least a $ 50 fine in urban areas , with an alternative of two days of participation in a clean up team . On second offense , both . On third offense , one month of weekends , same for fourth thru sixth . If someone does not reform after all that , I do not know what to do . Prison is too much a drain on taxpayer .

Why Non Muslim can not enter muslim holy site ( Macca as example ) . What actually this mean ? ? 1 . Mouhammad used to tell his companions every piece of Quran that he recieves and they used to write it . It was not compiled into one book until after his death though . After he Died , The rulers made sure when they compiled the Quran that every verse they got through a trustworthie person and he had to have 2 witnesses that heard the Prophet say that verse.The significance of Mouhammad not being able to read or write , means that he couldnt have been able to come up with such PERFECT words . That proved to everyone that these words where Alla 's words2 . Non muslims CAN enter mosques .

"My bad habit : chewing my fingers . What is the best way to stop it and break the habit ? I 've been chewing my fingers ever since I was in elementary . Nowadays , even at 20 - I occasionally chew on them when I get a little nervous or jittery , but I do n't even realize that . It 's getting a bit annoying and embarassing ... how do I stop it ? HMMMM some very interesting answers here that I like ... .Such as the rubber band idea . I would recomend that idea and see if that helps . If not ... .First of all as a former thumb sucker and smoker I understand oral fixations ( I quit the thumb thing a 12 started smoking at 13 and just quit that at 22 , about two months ago ) . Even now you will usually catch me with a touthpick , rubber band , bottle lid , pencils , or other item in my mouth . I have seriously cut back the habbit and consiously have to make efforts not to do it . Here are some suggestions . First of all peppers contain volitale oils that can chemically burn skin so avoid those . Purchase some alum powder and mix the powder with a few drops of water ( Enough to make a slightly runny paste . ) and soak your fingers in it . Alum is very , unpleasantly bitter and will immediately make your mouth pucker . Some people like lemon juice or tobasco so using those items usually does n't work because the taste is n't very strong . Next put up sticky notes at the places you are most like to do this . Repeating to yourself that this is bad trains your mind to avoid doing it subconsciously . If you are like me you also put your hand on your face ( or chin in hand , whatever ) . You can curb this action as well by improving your posture . Freeze yourself the next time you catch yourself doing this ( or finger chewing ) and analyze how you are sitting . Usually slumped with your elbow on the table or with your elbow semi supported by your stomach or chest . If you start improving your posture then you will become less inclined to hold your arm up unsupported for very long . I am using an exercise ball for a computer chair right now to retrain my posture . My doctor recomended it and I highly agree , I 've already noticed a difference.Cheer up though . Some studies say that finger chewing , nail biting , and other oral fixations are all signs of higher intelligence . It is believed that the brain in these cases works so fast that it actually gets bored or is somehow unstimulated . By controlling physical movement while mental processes such as reading or talking occur your brain is exercising itself and making you smarter and faster by training itself to multitask.Oh and a side note . Many people often notice that they chew nails/fingers in response to nervousness . The sucking/chewing motion is deeply ingrained in our most primitive side as being calming . When we are babies and we recieve food ( suckle ) subconciously we are aware of being protected by our mothers . The sucking/chewing motion along with full belly releases seratonin in the child inducing pleasure and happiness . In response to certain stresses adults will ocassionally do the same thing for the chemical calm it can induce , without even thinking about it . I tend to do this in the store especially when I ca n't find something . I feel lost and confused and tend to stick the tip of one or more finger in my mouth while looking .",0

I believe that is the same type of question as where did the matter in the big bang theory come from ? In accordance with the physical laws of this universe , it is impossible for the matter in the big bang theory to have come out of nothing or to have just always existed . It is impossible for something to come out of nothing ... I 'm sure you agree with this . Also , the universe is expanding , which indicates that it had a beginning point in time . So you 're question appears to be , `` If it is impossible for the earth to have always been in existance , how is it logical to believe that God has always been in existance ? `` The thing is , we know that the earth had a beginning and that it is impossible for it to have just come about on its own by the physical laws of this world . But if God created everything ( which I believe He did ) , then He is not bound by the laws He created . He made up the laws of physics . How could He be limited to those laws ? We can not think of God in terms of our physical world . God made up the rules , therefore God is not under the rules . He is eternal . The world which He created is not . Here 's another thought I 'm just going to throw out here , even though it does not go right along with your original question . If you believe that you have a soul or a spirit , or if you believe in any type of spirit beings , how could these have come about by purely by physical means ? Can spiritual things come from physical things ? If this world only came about by matter and not by God , how could matter produce spiritual things ? `` For by Him [ Jesus ] all things were created : things in heaven and on earth , visible and invisble , whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities ; all things were created by Him and for Him . He is before all things , and in Him all things hold together . '' Colossians 1:16-17 ( [ Jesus ] was added by me for clarification of the pronoun Him . )",0

Too young to be cast as leading lady , she started with bit roles only , but was not missed , and quickly graduated to lead roles in low budget movies . She was extremely versatile , beautiful , charming , and stole everybody 's heart by her captivating looks and inspired performances in each of her film . She quickly out-shadowed and dethroned the established queens in a very short time because of her histrionics . Mumtaz was sensitive , quick to understand and translate every nuance hinted at , onto the screen . Even in her brief roles against established actresses , she was the one who got noticed more and lingered in viewers memories for longer periods . She acted in more than 100 films during a short career span of 14 years , and there is not even a single film in which her performance could not be termed as excellent . In her very first film with significant banner and role , Khilona ( 1970 ) , she won the most coveted Filmfare award in 1970 . She has also been awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by Filmfare in 1997 . She was in the Marilyn Monroe mould ; every man 's fantasy woman . She outshone everybody because of the simple reason that she was so versatile that every role appeared as if it was written with just Mumtaz in mind . Whether the role was negative or positive , serious or light , she proved her worth . Whether the role was for an urbanite or rustic , majestic or pauper , innocent or vile , gentle or venomous , coy or flaunting , Mumtaz just fitted them like a glove . The public adulation for her is still strong . The response to the continuous spate of screening of her movies on various television channels , even after more than two decades of her self-retirement , proves her tremendous unending popularity due to her incomparable charisma .",0

why is it that i 've never actually seen anyone cooking the ground beef at taco bell ? The beef at Taco Bell ( as well as most/all other Taco Bell meats ) arrives at the restaurant precooked . It is sealed precooked and preseasoned in plastic bags . The bags are heated by floating them in 15 gallon pots of boiling water until they are fully heated to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.This is actually more sanitary than cooking the meat onsite because there is never any raw meat in the resturant . It is also more efficient for very high capacity resurants like Taco Bell.Now ... Ask about the beans .,0

"What 's the velocity of an electron around the atom nucleus ? I have a partial answer for you . In Hydrogen , the electron can be thought of as having a velocity of c/137 ( the speed of light times the fine structure constant ) .

"Why are celebs / other useless people paid so much ? Something I really do n't get.Why does someone that looks good ( in the right light and make up ) but does n't have two brain cells to rub together get paid millions for a movie deal ( even if they ca n't act ) ? Why do even dumber football stars get paid even more ? Double if they 've got a paternity suit or killed someone in the past ? Why also are teachers , nurses and other public servants that actually contribute to our quality of life paid so little ? My life is richer when I 'm not watching brainless celebs and sports stars on TV and I could live my life 100 % without any of them . I would not be living my happy comfortable life , however , if it was n't for teachers / nurses and other public servants.Someone help me understand why completely useless dreggs of society get paid so much . Please . A measure of the quality of life is not confined to the 'better ' things in life.Most people feel the need to relax , have fun and dream a little . Sometimes this is a reward for having done well , for others this may be an escape from not having everything they might wish.The argument for paying celebrities / sports stars huge amounts of money is fairly simple . Put those people on the screen / field and huge numbers will pay to watch , replace them with people with 98 % of their 'talents ' and hardly anyone will watch.A teacher or nurse touches the life of hundreds of people , celebs reach tens of millions . Another thing to remember is that having money through celebrity also has a burden . First , on a personal level public adoration is like an addiction , it is very difficult to deal with 'lows ' after the 'highs ' of performing . This is a major cause of the drug dependencies found in non-sports celebs - just look at rock stars.Secondly , 'people ' extract a price for their adoration . Celebrities become public property and have little or no private life unless they are very , very lucky.No celeb ( with any future ) will complain about stuff they need to do while in their public persona . Tom Cruise is a good example - will sign every autograph request at a premiere - he arrives hours early to do so . Julia Roberts explains that she makes movies because she loves it , the $ 25 million fees are for having to put up with the massive media and public intrusion.The intrusion into stars private lives is because of the insatiable appetite that the paying public has for coverage of their favorites.Only the very few very lucky or very litigious stars have a true private life.Finally , money is only function of how much people will pay - supply and demand.If the world only had a few thousand teachers , nurses ( I hesitate at public servants ; - ) ) perhaps they would be the superstars being paid the huge amounts of money ?",0

"Where did the wedding custom of the bride wearing white come from ? The tradition of wearing white at weddings began due to the choice of colour of the wedding dress of Queen Victoria at her wedding to Prince Albert . Queen Victoria was not the first royal bride to wear a white wedding gown , but the first of the modern era . White had been a traditional colour of royal mourning , and although not often utilized as such , white was not considered a suitable choice for a royal wedding . Victoria 's choice popularized the white gown as no other had before her . Previously , brides wore their best clothes or the most expensive new clothes they could afford . Gold or gold-threaded dresses became popular with royal brides ; the rank-and-file wore dresses that reflected their station . White was one of many choices , pastel shades were also popular .",0
"Why is the ocean blue ? It might sound like i 'm joking.. But i really need to know . Is it because it 's reflecting off the sky ? Water is faint blue . Although water appears clear in small quanities ( like a glass of water ) , the blue color becomes visible the more water we look through . Thus , deep lakes and seas are bluer than a shallow river.Other factors can affect the color we see : 1 . Particles and solutes can absorb light , as in tea or coffee . Green algae in rivers and streams often lend a blue-green color . The red sea has occasional blooms of red Trichodesmium erythraeum algae . 2 . Particles in water can scatter light . The Colorado river is often muddy red because of suspended reddish silt in the water . Some mountain lakes and streams with finely gound rock , such as glacial flour , are tourquise . Light scattering by suspended matter is required in order that the blue light produced by water 's absorption can return to the surface and be observed . Such scattering can also shift the spectrum of the emerging photons toward the green , a color often seen when water laden with suspended particles is observed . 3 . The surface of seas and lakes often reflect blue skylight , making them appear bluer . [ [ [ Montana reflection . ] ] ] The relative contribution of reflected skylight and the light scattered back from the depths is strongly dependent on observation angle .",0

Lucifer , who was second-in-command next to God himself , said to have been the most beautiful of all God 's angels , desired to be more powerful than God and sought to rebel against Him .

"What can the United States do to improve it 's relations with India ? well , one easy way to improve relations with india would be to side with them in the border dispute with pakistan over the territory of kashmir . this politically untenable in the united states however , and has the potential to drag the US into what could turn into a nuclear war . so that 's right out.another option would be to sign a preferential trade agreement with india , but this would likely be nixed by the WTO.giving them free stuff is always a plus , but that costs money.probably the best thing the US can do is to continue doing what it 's doing - particularly , outsourcing software jobs at wages well above india 's national average , allowing lots of indian students to come to the US to study , hiring indians on work visas for high-paying jobs , and continuing free trade in infrastructure like steel and concrete to support india 's growth.the biggest bone of contention is probably the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . india is one of a very few nations which has refused to sign it and this is a big problem for the US . india will receive only limited military support from america until the two countries reconcile their differences over this treaty .",0

"How does temperature affect the taste of food and drink ? For example , white wine , tap water , Cointreau , lager and even chocolate taste much better cold . On the other hand , tea , coffee and brandy , as well as most cooked meals , taste much better warm or hot . English beer and red wine are better at room or cellar temperature . Why ? Heat amplifies smell , and most of `` taste '' is actually based on smell . Without smell , coffee and chocolate would just be bitter anf gross . So aromatic things smell more strongly . Cold also delays the taste of things , so cold chocolate probably loses enough of the bitterness by being cold , while retaining enough aroma , such that that might make it better . Of course , if you like your chocolate bitter ( like I do ) you wo n't prefer it cold for taste reasons . I think cold chocolate -- especially dark chocolate -- is too tasteless.Occasionally there is a matter of texture as well . With chocolate , for instance , I 'd dispute that it tastes better cold , but it is certainly less melty . With beer/lager/ale , heat can make it go flat , which affects its taste , but with liquor , the intense burn of the alcohol makes the burn worse . Aromatic liquors like brandy/cognac and whiskey/scotch are heated to allow the aromas to be stronger , but really , most all alcohol is innately gross , and is an acquired taste -- so people tend to learn to like them in particular ways , but I do n't think any of it is particularly innate . Cognac , scotch , and fine wine all take years to `` learn '' to appreciate .",0

"Which search engine is better and brighter ?

Firefox address bar by defaults goes to 1 site listed on your search results.Google has tried to stay away from Spam/ misleading sites better than other search engines.Cons of Google : However , few problems with google , its web crawler dose n't capture hyperlinks from PDF files stored on net , a feature which Yahoo provides.Also , Google at present does not provide an index for video aggregation through the web crawler , a feature which Altavista provided since 1999 . The problems include accuracy of the media file . That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.Due to a larger share of 'searching ' community , Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs . Because most bloggers mention the word failure with President Bush 's name , the # 1 site on searching Failure is the website of President Bush.Yahoo is doing pretty good research in Search Technologies , for example Grokker.http : //www.grokker.com/grokker.html ? query=Anirudh % 20Koul & Yahoo=true & Daypop=true & numResults=250",0

"what does an r3 code mean on a military dd214 in terms of re-enlistment ? It really depends on which branch of service you were in . In the Navy if you had an RE-3 it was usually followed with a letter code such as RE-3P which meant you got out on a physical . I got out with an RE-3Z which meant that I took SSB/VSI . As far as re-enlistment goes it really depends on the letter code that comes after . If you got an RE-3P for a shoulder injury and you want to come back in a few years after it heals ... maybe no problem . If you got out on a 3P for something more serious or dependancy ( drug/alcohol ) it seriously reduces your chances of re-enlistment . But do n't forget that each service has their own codes . So see your local recruiter first . The Marine Corps has only one code that is good for immediate re-enlistment ( RE-1A ) , anything other than that will keep you out of the Corps , but not necessarily out of the National Guard ( for example ) . If your particular RE code keeps you out of your original branch , check out other branches and do n't forget Guard and Reserves . Good luck in your military career .",0

Fathers are allowed to take paternity leave so I do n't think you can get fired . But , I am not sure about that . You can check with your state 's labor dept . to confirm this . Your boss might not like the fact that you will need 4 days off for paternity leave especially since you are a relatively new employee . You will probably not get paid since you most likely have n't accrued sick or vacation time . You should give your boss as much advance notice as you can so he can plan accordingly . If you work for a company that has a Human Resources Dept . you might want to check with them to see how many days you can take ( it may be more than 4 ) and whether you have any sick time that would pay you while your out . You can also go to www.laborlawtalk.com and see if you can get an answer to your paternity leave questions .",0

"why is the child support system not more fair to the fathers who are in their child ` s life ? What cheermom stated demonstrates that there are similarities between California and Iowa . The point to keep in mind is that the Child Support Systems are usually divided into multiple sections . For those who work with individuals involved in the various cases , those who look out for the interests of the children , those are involved in the getting payments form the State to the primary care giver of the child , and those who collect money owed by a parent of record who is mandated by the court to make payments . These departments must follow the orders of the court . That is , a parent who is working to be involved in the life of the child is a great thing , but if they are not paying their court ordered child support payments , these departments have no choice but to act for the court and collect the funds from the delinquent parent . If a parent disagrees with the amount owed ( for whatever reason ) , their argument is not with the State departments but with the court and they must go back to the court to have a new order issued.Here in Iowa they will go after the delinquent parent irregardless of their job position and this includes working with other States . Only the court can change this reality.I realize that it can be frustrating , but the parents are best served if they do not try to mix things such as visitations and child support payments , the courts view them as two different actions .",0

"May I Know which Organ Produces Blood PLasma ? I need it for school homework before 2 Febuary plz ! ! ! ! ! ! ! No organ produces Blood Plasma , it is a product of several organs or one could say the body . It consists of ( mostly ) water , salts ( electrolytes ) , and proteins ( albumin and antibodies being the majority ) . All the water , salts , and proteins ultimately are derived from the GI tract ; i.e. , what you eat . The water and salts are regulated by the renal system . Albumin is produced by the liver ( and it is in the majority for plasma protein ) and antibodies are a product of the immune system . There is also a balance of proteins and water within the vasculature ( intravascular space ) and without ( extravascular space ) . So , there is always an influx/efflux balance between your tissues and the vasculature depending on the osmostic pressure ( mostly ) and mechanical pressure . This is all in one giant balance or homeostasis most of the time . Hence , why it 's a good idea to see plasma as a total body product.I just read the above answers . Plasma is NOT produced in the bone marrow . Blood cells are produced in the marrow . Plasma is what you have left over when you remove those cells .",0

"Which is the fastest computer in the world ? Well , there are three perspectives to your question , which are as follows : ( 1 ) A super computer ( 2 ) A desktop computer ( 3 ) Anything in a general sense that can compute.For the third perspective , The fastest computer in the world is much faster than the desktop in front of you , and it is sitting right on top of your shoulders ! The human brain is an amazing computing device and the fastest processor available right now . In supercomputers , the BlueGene/L - eServer Blue Gene Solution stationed at DOE/NNSA/LLNL at Livermore in California is ruling the world . It has , hold on your breath , 131072 processors , each processor with an individual performance of 2.8 GigaFlops ( PowerPC 440 700 MHz ) . It has a main memory of 32768 GB and is 3 times more powerful in processing than its immediate competitor ( Also by IBM ) . Surprisingly , its still in expansion phase . Blue Gene is an IBM Research project dedicated to exploring the frontiers in supercomputing : in computer architecture , in the software required to program and control massively parallel systems , and in the use of computation to advance our understanding of important biological processes such as protein folding.As for the fastest desktop configuration , it keeps changing every now and then . An interesting fact to note , Intel had come up with 4GHz chip , but could not commercialize it because of the excessive heating which could damage the chip . Hope to see such a chip soon . As on 6th January 2006 , Xi MTower 64 AGE-SLI is considered to be the fastest desktop Computer .

You can see this in real life : A candle flame is yellow , but a blowtorch , which is much hotter , is blue.Color also gives astronomers an indication of how old the star is : Stars cool down as they age , so a red star would be very old and on its way to dyinng ( Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star , on its way out ) , while white and blue stars are more recently formed",0

MADD claims that drunks could have prevented some of those accidents if their reaction time which was impaired by alcohol were eliminated . However if 60 % of all accidents that involve alcohol are caused by the sober person , if everyone quit drinking and driving if you go by the stats supplied by MADD , the amount of accidents would actually rise around 30 % . From a purely mathematical perspective , you 're right . But of course this would eliminate using the proper logic that the lack of alcohol intake makes for fewer impaired drivers that would be unable to effectively avoid an accident.Either way , do n't drink and drive ... you might spill your drink .",0

"How to fight graft and corruption ? If it is in a corporation , there are special laws to grant you whistleblower status , and you can move into this role under a degree of legal protection from retribution.If it is in a government , then it can be very difficult depending on the nature of the government . Dictatorships are notorious for systemic corruption , and there is little that can be done without coup or significant intervention ( or perhaps populist uprising , although you 'd be risking your life ) . In a democracy , the corruption is of a softer sort , and you may be able to counter-act it via a public interest campaign , or story presented to the news media.Now if the graft and corruption is within your own heart ... that 's a real toughie . It requires a degree of personal strength and conviction to ideals which extend beyond your person .

Once you determine the feasibility of how long it will take to get yourself set up properly with the city - as well as if you will need to open in an area other than the one you might have wished to - then it is just a matter of getting the business side of things in order , locating & securing a building , furnishing it & hiring dancers.Good luck !",0

"what is the differece between a 5 port router and a 5 port switch ? First you need to know th differnce . To understand the difference between a router and a switch you need to understand the ISO model.ISO/OSI Network ModelThe standard model for networking protocols and distributed applications is the International Standard Organization 's Open System Interconnect ( ISO/OSI ) model . It defines seven network layers . Layer 1 - Physical Physical layer defines the cable or physical medium itself , e.g. , thinnet , thicknet , unshielded twisted pairs ( UTP ) . All media are functionally equivalent . The main difference is in convenience and cost of installation and maintenance . Converters from one media to another operate at this level . Layer 2 - Data Link Data Link layer defines the format of data on the network . A network data frame , aka packet , includes checksum , source and destination address , and data . The largest packet that can be sent through a data link layer defines the Maximum Transmission Unit ( MTU ) . The data link layer handles the physical and logical connections to the packet 's destination , using a network interface . A host connected to an Ethernet would have an Ethernet interface to handle connections to the outside world , and a loopback interface to send packets to itself . Ethernet addresses a host using a unique , 48-bit address called its Ethernet address or Media Access Control ( MAC ) address . MAC addresses are usually represented as six colon-separated pairs of hex digits , e.g. , 8:0:20:11 : ac:85 . This number is unique and is associated with a particular Ethernet device . Hosts with multiple network interfaces should use the same MAC address on each . The data link layer 's protocol-specific header specifies the MAC address of the packet 's source and destination . When a packet is sent to all hosts ( broadcast ) , a special MAC address ( ff : ff : ff : ff : ff : ff ) is used . Layer 3 - Network NFS uses Internetwork Protocol ( IP ) as its network layer interface . IP is responsible for routing , directing datagrams from one network to another . The network layer may have to break large datagrams , larger than MTU , into smaller packets and host receiving the packet will have to reassemble the fragmented datagram . The Internetwork Protocol identifies each host with a 32-bit IP address . IP addresses are written as four dot-separated decimal numbers between 0 and 255 , e.g. , 129.79.16.40 . The leading 1-3 bytes of the IP identify the network and the remaining bytes identifies the host on that network . The network portion of the IP is assigned by InterNIC Registration Services , under the contract to the National Science Foundation , and the host portion of the IP is assigned by the local network administrators , locally by noc @ indiana.edu . For large sites , usually subnetted like ours , the first two bytes represents the network portion of the IP , and the third and fourth bytes identify the subnet and host respectively . Even though IP packets are addressed using IP addresses , hardware addresses must be used to actually transport data from one host to another . The Address Resolution Protocol ( ARP ) is used to map the IP address to it hardware address . Layer 4 - Transport Transport layer subdivides user-buffer into network-buffer sized datagrams and enforces desired transmission control . Two transport protocols , Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) and User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) , sits at the transport layer . Reliability and speed are the primary difference between these two protocols . TCP establishes connections between two hosts on the network through 'sockets ' which are determined by the IP address and port number . TCP keeps track of the packet delivery order and the packets that must be resent . Maintaining this information for each connection makes TCP a stateful protocol . UDP on the other hand provides a low overhead transmission service , but with less error checking . NFS is built on top of UDP because of its speed and statelessness . Statelessness simplifies the crash",0

The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival and viewable online.Prior to the launch of her talk show , DeGeneres scored a rare coup in 2004 with simultaneous achievements on stage , film and in the literary world . She enjoyed unprecedented popular and critical response to her character , 'Dory , ' the fish with extreme short term memory , in the blockbuster Disney/Pixar animated feature film , `` Finding Nemo .

The resulting special aired on June 28th , 2003 and scored higher ratings than any HBO comedy special had in years . It was subsequently nominated for two Emmys including Outstanding Individual Performance In A Variety Or Music Program and Outstanding Variety , Music Or Comedy Special .

In October , 2003 , Simon & Schuster published DeGeneres ' second book , The Funny Thing Is ... , comprised of the author 's comedic short stories and essays . The book hit the New York Times ' Bestseller list upon its release . In 2005 , DeGeneres was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for the audio version of the book . A performer with a keen sense of comedy in the moment , DeGeneres garnered rave reviews for her performance hosting the 2001 Primetime Emmy Awards . Taking the reins of the high profile event with assuredness , she provided a perfect balance of wit with heartfelt emotion and gave the post-September 11th telecast audience a reason to laugh . DeGeneres ' career began as an emcee at a local comedy club in her hometown of New Orleans , which led to national recognition in 1982 when her videotaped club performances won Showtime 's `` Funniest Person In America .

"If a person has a child in the US , and they themselves are n't citizens , are they entitled to any benefits ? Can they receive Section 8 or welfare benefits for themselves and their child ? Would they be forced to return to their country with the child ? Is citizen status of child enough to gain any benefits ? They are entitled to a limited number of benefits because the US will not take away the child from you ( do n't worry about that unless you prove that you are terrible parents ) Anyway returning to the question - Since the child was born in the US is thus a US citizen . You can confirm that because the child will be issued a Birth Certificate by the state and a Social Security Number by the SS Office . Based on your income your child and for a certain period of time the mother can qualify for medical aid by the govt . You need to get in touch with the hospital 's social workers or the local Social Services Department office . Do that ASAP as the child will need doctor 's visits and routine shots . There are also programs such as Food Stamps and such that will help in the financial for taking care of the child . In case the parents visas expire and have to return back to their country , they can take the baby with them . Just ensure that you have with you the ss , birth certificate , ( I am not sure about the US passport though ) . But rest assured worrying about the citizenship should not be the biggest concern as much as the care of both the `` little baby '' and the mother . Good luck . It 's still good if you can ask an immigration attorney ( remember the first visit is always free @ least in the tri-state ) .",0

"What happened to Sayuri 's sister in Memoirs of a Geisha ? Do they ever explain ? ( Are they setting us up for a sequel ? ? ? hehe ) I assume you 've only seen the movie . After her sister ran away , she went back to the fishing village that they came from . Finding mother and father dead she had no place to stay there and ran away with the guy she had been seeing before they were taken from their home , Mr. Tanaka 's ( the guy who suggested the girls be sold ) assistant 's son . Sayuri learns this in the letter from Mr. Tanaka that came with the altar tablets from her parents.I do n't think there will be a sequel as Sayuri pretty much resigned that she would never see her sister again , and she really was n't mentioned after we learned this .

"what impcat of personal computers does it have on correspondence ? Personal computers introduced a more efficient form of asynchronous communication . Synchronous communication is when both parties are talking , communicating at the same time . This is like a chat room , or a telephone conversation . The difficulty that this can cause arises with the different time zones , schedule conflicts , etc.Asychronous communication is when both parties need not be present , thereby eliminating the difficulty of time zones and other scheduling difficulties . Prior to personal computers being used for correspondence , mail was used . Because of the delays between writing a message , a letter , and the recipient getting the letter , this was not very efficient . The telegraph sped up the process a bit , but could be expensive , and did not allow for long and detailed messages . Fax machines helped speed up the process , but , for a long time , you needed specialized and expensive equipment . E-mail introduced a very fast , and inexpensive , means of asynchronous communication , and because personal computers are becoming more and more common , more people are able to use the process .",0

Suggestions/comments welcome ! What about a bed and breakfast ? If you are staying there while vacationing than I would see no reason for them to say no . It would probably be good for business too , if you gave them a picture to use in a brochure .

"What is everything you know about the VIETNAM WAR. ? i need everything and anything you know or may come across . thanks . Basically , it was a failure ( like today 's war in Iraq ) and many American soldiers ' lives were lost.The Vietnam War or Second Indochina War 1 was a conflict between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( DRVN , or North Vietnam ) , allied with the National Liberation Front ( NLF , or `` Viet Cong '' ) against the Republic of Vietnam ( RVN , or South Vietnam ) , and its allies — notably the United States military in support of the South , with US combat troops involved from shortly after the Korean War until the official withdrawal in 1975.After France 's attempted recolonization of Indochina was defeated in 1954 by the Viet Minh at the battle of Điện Biên Phủ , an agreement to temporarily partition the country in two with a de-militarized zone ( DMZ ) was reached at the Geneva Conference ( 1954 ) . The `` Vietnam War '' ostensibly began as a civil war between feuding governments . Being Western-oriented and far less popular than Hồ Chí Minh 's northern rebellion , the South Vietnam government fought largely to maintain its governing status within the partitioned entity , rather than to `` unify the country '' as was the goal of the North . Fighting began in 1957 and with U.S. and Soviet-Chinese involvement would steadily escalate and spill over into the neighboring Indochinese countries of Cambodia and Laos.The Geneva partition was not a natural division of Vietnam and was not intended to create two separate countries . But the South government , with the support of the United States , blocked the Geneva scheduled elections for reunification . In the context of the Cold War , and with the recent Korean War as a precedent , the U.S. had feared that a reunified Vietnam would elect a Communist government under the popular Hồ Chí Minh . South Vietnam and its Western allies portrayed the conflict as based in a principled opposition to communism —to deter the expansion of Soviet-based control throughout Southeast Asia , and to set the tone for any likely future superpower conflicts . The North Vietnamese government and its Southern dissident allies ( NLF ) viewed the war as a struggle to reunite the country and to repel a foreign aggressor —a virtual continuation of the earlier war for independence against the French.After fifteen years of protracted fighting and massive civilian and military casualties , major direct U.S. involvement ended with the signing of the Paris Peace Accords in 1973 . Fighting between Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) forces against the dominant combined People 's Army of Vietnam ( PAVN ) and NLF forces would soon bring an end to the RVN and the war . With the Northern victory , the country was unified as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam ( SRV ) with a communist-controlled government based in the new capital Hanoi.This is just a brief summary .

"Will someday the idea of human cloning will be legal ? Right now , it 's just an idea . But who knows in the future suddenly we found someone that looks very identical to us like our twin ! There is too much movie out there that depict this phenom , is n't it ? So how we can sure that this is not possible to be legal in the future ? Hi there , You are absolutely right . It is likely that Human Cloning will be accepted in the future . Just think of it ... Would n't it be wonderful to clone persons like Einstein , Socrates , and other great people who have influenced this world ? But I think there must be restrictions on whom to clone . If not , the population of this world will rise rapidly . Also , it will give rise to unnecessary chaos and disorder regarding who is who . And I also think the technology should be known to a limited number of scientists , because there is a likely chance of illegal cloning ( as in the movie 'The Sixth Day ' ) If every person gets to know the technology , he can take the creation into his own hands , and so all the unethical things are likely to happen . So , on the whole , Human Cloning is n't a bad idea , provided there are 'proper ' laws made and 'implemented ' , and people think rationally.rule wid style n luv @ vinnyEdit : Well , I do agree with you that a lot depends on the society and the brought-up of the person , but I was just trying to bring out a point there .

"what are the differences between the processes of fission and fusion ? The main difference that there is between fission and fusion is that fission is the splitting of an atom to form two smaller ones while fusion is the fusing of two smaller atoms to form a larger atom . In each of these the binding energy of the final product or products is higher than that of the prerequisites . This is explained more fully in the next section ( Binding Energy ) .Fission itself is a nuclear process which does not usually occur naturally in nature ( at least not that we know of ) as it requires a large mass and an incident neutron to start the reaction . However this would not last for a long time as the reaction would explode and produce a result such as in an atomic bomb . This volatile nature is what prevents fission from occurring for any length of time naturally.Fusion on the other hand is a process which occurs quite naturally . In fact , if fusion did not occur naturally we would not be around today . This is due to stars being the result of the fusion process , the fusion of mainly light atoms into heavier atoms . Fusion also releases a lot more energy in comparison to fission in relation to the mass input . Put simply you will get more energy released from the fusion of 1kg of hydrogen ions than you will from fission of 1kg of Uranium .",0

"what is the order of the magnitude of the power of a light source so that the photons can knock me over ? To Skully : I often jump too quickly to answer a question , but it 's a bad habit . Solar sails and radiometers : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sailhttp : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes_radiometerIn fact , light is responsible for the motion of all electrons.As for the original question , I 'm going to assume that you 're a two meter long ( rather tall , actually ) 65 kilogram plank . Your center of gravity would have to be displaced about .25 meters ( off your feet ) to tip you over . Gravity exerts a maximum torque of about 80 N*m on you . At the top of your head , that torque produces 40 newtons . When it 's reflected , light exerts a `` pressure '' of 2*I/c where I is the intensity of light ( in watts per meter^2 ) . Multiplying both sides by area and plugging this into my calculator produces about 6 billion watts ( and remember , that 's if you wear a reflective surface on your head and it 's only enough to tip you over , not actually knock you down ) . I 'd say you 're pretty safe from sudden `` light gusts '' .",0

Probably a male orca somewhere , there was a gray whale calf kept for a while recovering from a stranding , but I do n't know whether it attained a larger size than a male orca before it was returned to the wild . Blue whales are the only whales that reach 30m and 120 t and they have never been kept in captivity",0
"If I use a mixture of a ten per cent of alcohol and a ninety per gasoline , does the octane increase its level ? Short answer : yes.Octane levels are based on what is called a `` knock resistance . '' When an engine burns gas , the smaller the gas molecules , the quicker it will burn . If it burns too quickly , the energy will be released faster than the piston can use the energy . The excess energy makes the piston rattle in the chamber , `` knocking '' back and forth -- if you 've ever heard a sound like rattling marbles in the engine of an old car climbing a hill , you know what I mean here.Octane is a hydrocarbon with eight carbon atoms ( hence the `` oct '' prefix ) . But gasoline that you get at the pump is not pure octane -- it contains some lighter stuff ( like hexane and septane ) and some heavier stuff ( like novane and decane ) . Plus , there are aspects of whether the molecules in the gas are in straight chains or in branched chains . But when a consumer buys gasoline , they need some sense of what they 're getting to make sure that they 're not getting crap that will burn too quickly and mess up their engine . So instead of trying to make all gas pure octane ( which would be ridiculously expensive and wasteful ) , or trying to give a consumer a detailed assay of the types of hydrocarbons in the gas ( which would be meaningless for the consumer and likewise expensive ) , they formulate the gas into certain knock ratios . The speed of burning is measured against 2,2,4-trimethylpentane ( a type of octane ) and n-pentane . So 87 octane gas knocks as much as a mixture of 13 % pentane and 87 % octane , etc . They compare the knocking effect.Ethanol helps to slow down the burning of the gas , and does work as an actane booster . The follwing link says that 10 % ethanol added to 92 octane will give an octane rating of 94.7 , but warns that ethanol is mildly corrosive to some engine parts .",0

"What do you think about Atheists ? What can u say about their lifestyle ? do they stil have a place in heaven ? I think Atheists have a right to believe as they do , and I do not think they are stupid for their beliefs . The lifestyles of different Atheists vary , so it is hard to comment on an Atheist `` Lifestyle . '' In my opinion , Atheists could benefit from certain practices that are usually associated with religion , but do not necessarily have to be . For example , daily affirmations of what is good in life , and daily reflections on how to live the best life , and meditation to strengthen one 's qualities and so on . Yes , they have a place in heaven , if there is a heaven .",0

"is buffy the vampire slayer postmodern ? if so why ? In a word , yes . The longer version is that BtVS is a piece of postmodern art because : '' In terms of popular culture and mass media , there has been a large push towards the postmodern tendency of `` bricolage , pastiche and intertextuality '' ( Altman , 1999:141 ) in recent years . In regards to BtVS , the series creator , Joss Whedon , has stated when he was forming the character of Buffy he thought of `` the little girl , the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed , in every horror movie . The idea of Buffy was to subvert that idea , that image , and create someone who was a hero where she had always been a victim . That element of surprise , that element of genre busting is very much at the heart of the series '' ( 2001 ) . The notion of `` genre busting '' is found in the postmodern mixing of horror , comedy and drama , and results in the playful deconstruction of genre conventions , forcing the audience to question their assumed knowledge of the 'rules ' of a particular genre , such as the formal repetitive structure of horror films ( Dika , 1987:87 ) '' Therefore , the primary reason why the show can be considered postmodern is that , from its very inception , the show was intended to flip and subvert the horror movie standard of the blonde girl being slain by the monster in the dark alley . BtVS also goes on to subvert standard readings of text and narrative by becoming extra-textual or outside of the text , by making transgressive allusions and references . Buffy 's postmodernism comprises not only self-awareness but also awareness of other shows , movies , books and anything else , including referring to Martha Stewart as a demon.Postmodernism also often defines itself by what it is not . In the case of Buffy , the show ( and its creator ) often defines itself by setting itself apart from something else . Thus , for instance , in Buffy many episodes , scenes or lines start with a cliché and then move on from it to subvert that cliché or exaggerate it in unconventional ways for dramatic purposes . This is demonstrated most clearly when a character questions a commonly used saying . For instance , in the season 2 episode , 'Lie to Me ' , Willow wonders why people say 'sticks out like a sore thumb ' : Xander : In no way do we stick out like sore thumbs . Willow : Okay , but do they really stick out ? Xander : What ? Willow : Sore thumbs . Do they stick out ? I mean , have you ever seen a thumb and gone , 'Wow ! That baby is sore ! ' Xander : You have too many thoughts.Another example is the show 's original conceit : the cliche that high school can be hell is given a postmodern twist by creating a show in which high school was literally on the mouth of hell .",0
"Which city is called as HI-TECH City ? Hyderabad is also known as the second Silicon Valley [ 2 ] in India after Bangalore . Hyderabad 's IT exports exceeded the $ 1 billion mark in 2004 [ 3 ] . Hyderabad has made heavy investments in digital infrastructure and is well known throughout India for its technology sector . In the late 1990s and the early years of the 21st century , the increasing numbers of IT and ITES companies located here - both home-grown ones as well as offshoots of multinational companies - have led civic boosters to call their city `` Cyberabad '' .The axis of the HITEC City ( Hyderabad Information Technology and Engineering Consultancy Services City ) is an artistically and yet functionally built ten-storey cylindrical building ( see image below ) aptly named `` Cyber Towers '' , surrounded by a galaxy of imposing structures raised to house IT companies , foreign and Indian .

"Why should things like language change just for the sake of new generations ? Case in point . Language may change for clarity and definition , such as the reason for thee , thou , thy and thine . Ok , you , your , and yours , which I still believe are acceptable for Worship , and religious expressions ; The Spanish Language uses that form for familiarity among personal relatives ; but did you know that the words `` blessed '' , `` doth '' `` knowest '' and `` thinketh '' can be related to a `` lisp tongue '' ie , . `` All I want for Chrithmath ith my two front teeth '' . Therefore a word like blessed would be pronouced `` Blethed '' and thinks `` thinkth '' or phonetically `` thinketh '' .My real point , however , is that most of todays language changes are perverse , gutteral , and obscene . As for traditions ; only the most valuable ones , based upon morality and righteousness , are becoming extinct.I ask you ; what do you say ? Language does n't change for the sake of a new generation . The change had already started generations before . Who came up with the obscenities in the first place ? Who decided that these sounds when put together to make words would be vulgar ? This is an interesting question . Your examples are interesting , also . I 'm not sure it is quite that simple . I 'm thinking that you would need a nation of people to lose their teeth permanently for at least a couple of generations for the new pronunciation to take effect .",0

I 'm not gon na like them only because they 're so `` cool '' . Hell No.My opinionWho else feels the same ? My personal opinion as to why everyone is now a Green Day fan is that they have what is commonly reffered to as `` selling out '' . Large music lables dish out millions and millions to promote artists albums , and in return , get air time , national tours in large venues , and thier latest single played on Mtv ( the same corporation that tells you what to think , what to say , and what to listen to ) . It is because people are being force-fed this mainstream bullshit pop music , that people have infatuations with a particular group for an extended period of time . Also , to make more money for the record executives , bands sometimes release up to five singles off of just one album . This creates the illusion that the CD is doing well , and continues to place the band in the spotlight , in return , making more money . Bands with little or no talent ( Maroon 5 ) can ride an album for over 2 years without producing any new material .",0

Iran has threatened that way for about 30 years and actually nothing has happened.There are some facts that I give you about Iran and Israel , its on you to decide:1 . Its a historical fact , Iranian King Koorosh after conquering Babylon rescued a group of Israelis that was prisoned there , his name is in Jews holy book ( the last part I have heard from a Jew friend ) 2 . Lots of famous Israel leaders born and grew up in Iran , want a sample ? Netaniaho3 . Jews live freely in Iran , no one do any harm to them , they are accepted as a god based religion and they are free to do they rituals and business , even send money to Israel if they want to , they can leave Iran and go Israel but they don't4 . Iran and Israel have n't done anything against each other , maybe cursing is the worst act5 . Although everyone think Iranian is Arabs Iranian are not arabs and they almost hate them specially because of what they have done when conquered Iran , so Iran and Israel have a common enemy6 . Israel have done anti Iraq operations many times , Iraq was Iran enemy ( they were in war for years ) 7 . Iran Nuclear program was at progress for years , Israel could do an operation when Iran was really weak ( After Iran-Iraq war exactly at the time they attack Iraq ) Maybe they yell at each others but they totally love each other ; ) Many hidden strings in Iraq and Middle east are in Iran hands , although Neo Conservatism theories which are at progress specially by UK urges that Israel needs peace and UK is the leader of Middle east politics from old times.So decide yourself , these are the facts that I know .",0

If so how could they get here , it being so many light years to the nearest star that may have planets ? there is a pretty convincing argument based on statistics , but that depends largely upon the assumptions one makes . it is called the drake equation : Nc = N * fp * ne * fl * fi * fc * fLwhereN represents the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy fp is the fraction of stars that have planets around them ne is the number of planets per star that are capable of sustaining life fl is the fraction of planets in ne where life evolves fi is the fraction of fl where intelligent life evolves fc is the fraction of fi that communicate fL is fraction of the planet 's life during which the communicating civilizations liveandNc represents the number of communicating civilizationsi snagged this from this page : http : //www.activemind.com/Mysterious/Topics/SETI/drake_equation.htmlwhich explains what some reasonable estimates for these values are , and includes a little javascript calculator thingy so you can plug in your own values.if you use their estimates , the final result is that there should be around 1000 civilizations capable of communicating in the galaxy.however a lot of this hinges on the value of fl , which is the fraction of planets capable of supporting life where life actually evolves . since we have no evidence to support any value for this parameter at all , it 's all pretty moot.however , we have only just begun started exploring our own solar system , and there have been possible ( though not conclusive ) signs of life even the next planet over , on mars . only time will tell , i suppose .",0

".SINCE CUSTOMERS KNOWN THEIR NEED AND WANTS THERE IS NO NEED FOR MARKETING DISCUSS ? Lets assume customers know all the products available in the market place . Most often there exists similar or substitute products in the market for example the chocolate market , Cadburys vs Nestle or in the soft drinks market Coca Cola vs Pepsi Cola or the car market . How would a potential buyer choose what brand to buy since it ’ s the same product ? To answer this question we must think in marketing terms such as the 4 p ’ s which are product , price , place and promotion . Price communicates a lot about the product such as , expensive means that the product is of the highest quality . Or cheap which can say – buy lots of me but don ’ t give it to your loved ones as a birthday present . Promotion is used to get customers to hear about the product and get them to try it . Product promotion is a strategy used to increase sales , increase product/brand awareness or get rid of stock . A product promotion could be a BOGOF ( buy one get one free ) , by one get second half price , money off coupons , etc . These strategies are used to get customers to buy more of your product or simply try it for the first time.Marketing is the process of exchanging products or the art of persuading people to buy your product . I said exchange because a customer will exchange money for the product they are buying , with so many me too products in the market place a business has to do all it can to convince customers that their product is better than the competition for whatever reason , that ’ s the art of Marketing . Coming up with the right products , setting the right prices , selling the product in the best and most convenient places ( having the product available for purchase ) , communicating the product to the public and convincing customers that your product is better then the competition is the art of selling .",0

"what are the advantages and disadvantages of using DSP over FPGA ? Programming a DSP is similar to programming any other type of microcontroller , except that it is designed with signal processing in mind . As such it is designed with extra multipliers and pipelines to allow faster signal processing . They also ( some do ) come with software libraries to implemented tested signal processing functions such as the fourier transform , and convolution.An FPGA is exactly what the name suggests : a programmable gate array . You program it as a piece of hardware . The FPGA basically implements look up tables and as such is good for doing complex logic very fast . Using languages such as VHDL and Verilog you can create complex logic structures . Many pre-writen FPGA cores exist that allow you to implement processors , multipliers , video/audio converters , network protocols ... just about anything . So an FPGA is extremely flexible . If you are looking to implement a complex system , then an FPGA is what you want.If you are using signal processing , and are testing an algorithm then a DSP would be best , as reprogramming an FPGA for signal processing tasks isnt as easy as it is for a DSP . You could how ever develop a DSP like FPGA core , but this would require extensive effort ... and unless you understood your algorithm well would waste development time.In the past I have with ease used an FPGA to build a system containing a processor , ethernet , serial ports , and 100s of digital I/Os ... this is exactly what they are suited for.Where as if i were building a digital equaliser for example , a DSP would be best .",0

"Have i screwed myself over ? If i slacked off for the first two years of highschool and failed a lot of classes , but now in my third year am making A 's and B 's have i screwed myself out of going to a good college like a University ? Not necessarily . Many colleges look at both your overall gpa and your last two years gpa . So , hopefully you will do very well this year and next year . Remember that you only have two more semesters to get grades before most applications are due ( you have this spring 's grades and next fall 's grades ) so it is critical that you do well . Remember , that gpa is one very important factor in admissions , but most colleges also want you to have high SAT or ACT scores , so you need to prepare for doing well on this test . You can study for it , and I like to have people study for it by buying a bunch of practice tests and taking a practice test a week for 8-12 weeks . Take a test , score it , and then look up every item you got wrong . Then repeat . You should see your scores improving.Finally , colleges really do want to see that you have some significant interests within and outside of school . So , you also need to show that you have leadership potential , or talent , or community impact . Clubs , hobbies , and community service can all be a part . Finally , you really need to be able to do a good personal statement . It probably would be helpful to address your poor grades , why you had them and what you learned about yourself so that you could turn it around . Be able to address your values and why you and the school you are applying to are a good match . Hang in there , do well , and remember that college applications are multifaceted .",0

"how are sedimentary rocks formed ? ? how are sedimentary rocks formed ? ? Sedimentary rocks can be divided into two major informal groups , referred to as clastics ( or siliciclastics ) and carbonates . Clastic rocks are formed by erosion of other rocks , igneous , metamorphic and sedimentary . These 'clasts ' can be mud , silt , sand , cobbles , or boulders , and are transported by wind , water , or gravity and accumulate where they eventually are buried and pressure and temperature subject them to diagenesis , the process that makes them from unconsolidated clasts to one rock mass . Shale , sandstone , and conglomerate are examples of clastics.Carbonates can work much differently since they form primarily in the oceans . Many carbonates are made from reefs and other living organisms that grow in the ocean . As these organisms die and leave behind their carbonate skeletons , rocks are formed . Other carbonates are formed from small grains called ooids , small balls that form by precipitating out of sea water , possibly with the help of bacteria or algae . Some ocean algae even form carbonate 'mud ' that eventually becomes hard rock . Another unusual group of sedimentary rocks are called evaporites . These are rocks like gypsum and rock salt that are deposited by evaporation of water in confined basins . The most fascinating part about sedimentary rocks is that they have a past , each one tells a story .",0
"What did captain James Cook say about the Aborigines ? Captain Cook had two encounters with the aborigines . At Kurnell near Sydney , the expedition landed and some natives threw spears at the party while muskets were fired at return.At Cooktown where the Endeavour run aground , relations were friendly . The kangaroo was named during this encounter when Cook asked what the animal was called and the natives replied kangaroo which meant I do n't know . Cook also met briefly with aboriginals on Bruny Island in 1777.Based on his limited meeting , Cook developed an incorrect impression that the inland was largely unoccupied . However , the Encyclopedia of Aboriginal Australia published in 1994 , reports that Cooks comments about aboriginals ( who he called Indians ) were generally complimentary .",0

"what do these college sports phrases mean ? 1 ) true freshman 2 ) fifth year senior 3 ) walk on 4 ) red shirt . Thanks The NCAA rules allow a player 5 years to complete his/her 4 years of eligibility.A true freshman is someone playing during the first year of eligibility.A fifth year senior is someone who sat out a year ( see red shirt ) and is completing the 4th year of eligibility during his/her 5th year in school.A walkon is someone who was not recruted and given a scholarship . The athlete just showed up , tried out , and was good enough to stay on the team.A red shirt is an athlete who is passing up a year of play to extend eligibility . Red shirted players are allowed to practice with the team but not take part in competition.Originally , red shirting was allowed if an athlete was injured severly enough to end his season . The team could petition the NCAA for an extra year of eligibilty , and the player was red shirted for the remainder of the year.The name comes from the practice of having injured football players wear a red practice jersey to protect him during practice . Today redshirting may be done to allow a player to gain an extra year of experience before playing in `` The Big Time '' . It also may be done as a personel management tool . If a coach has two equally good players competing for one position as quarterback , one may be redshirted . That way his eligability is n't used up sitting on the bench .",0

"a canadien hockey player in 1985 ? a canadien hockey player in 1985 On February 22 , 2002 , Wayne Gretzky made history as the architect of Canada 's first gold medal in Olympic men 's hockey in 50 years . It proved that three years after retirement , `` The Great One 's '' contribution to the game and country he loves is not over.Gretzky was only ten years old when his talent as the defenceman-winger-centre for the Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers caught the attention of Toronto Telegram sportswriter John Iaboni . His story about the prolific 369-goal scorer turned out to be a glimpse of what was in store for the greatest hockey player to lace up a pair of skates . Gretzky was born on January 26 , 1961 . By age two his father and `` greatest coach , '' Walter already had his son on skates . By the time he joined the Nadrofsky Steelers , he already had a reputation of carving out scoring opportunities against players twice his age and taller than his modest height.At 15 , he joined the Ontario Hockey Association , turning professional two years later as an underage junior with the Indianapolis Racers in the now defunct World Hockey Association ( WHA ) . He only played eight games for the Racers ( chalking up three goals and three assists ) before being traded to the WHA 's Edmonton Oilers where he was named WHA Rookie of the Year.In 1979 , the Edmonton Oilers entered the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . Gretzky remained in Edmonton nine seasons , leading the Oilers to four Stanley Cups , and helping to build hockey 's strongest franchise of the 1980s.Not surprisingly , Gretzky 's trade to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988 made front-page news and topped all national newscasts . Gretzky was the ambassador of hockey ; the struggling Kings needed to fill seats , and the NHL wanted to promote its game in the United States.Since joining the NHL , Gretzky has had more impact on the record book than any other player . By the time he retired , The Great One held over 60 NHL records and most of the sport 's prestigious hardware , including nine Hart Trophies for most valuable player and five Lester B. Pearson Trophies for MVP as voted by other players.His most cherished record , however , came on October 25 , 1989 , when he scored two goals and an assist to surpass the all-time points record set by his hero , Gordie Howe.Wayne Gretzky retired from professional hockey as a New York Ranger on April 18 , 1999 . In addition to the NHL , and his considerable charity work , he has made Canadians proud on the world stage - particularly as Executive Director of Team Canada for the 2002 Winter Olympics . Additionally , Gretzky is part owner of the Phoenix Coyotes.Canada 's Walk of Fame Trivia : Wayne Gretzky 's first jersey was No . 9 after his hockey hero , Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings .",0

"I recently discovered that my ascendant sign was Aires rather than cancer , how would this affect my chart ? My sun sign is `` virgo '' and I 'm particularly interested in the `` Love '' and `` Career '' elements of my chart . It mainly affects which horoscopes you should read . The rising sign is just as important as the Sun sign , and sometimes more so . You need to read Aries as well as Virgo.Horoscope forecasts are written as if each sign is in the rising position ( the `` 9 o'clock '' on a horoscope chart ) . Houses are arranged counterclockwise : the second house is at `` 8 o'clock , '' the third house is at `` 7 o'clock , '' and so on . If you 're a Virgo with Aries rising , Aries is at `` 9 o'clock '' ( first house ) and Virgo is five signs away at `` 4 o'clock '' ( sixth house ) .Horoscope forecasts describe events that relate to planetary activity in the houses . They 'll often describe the effect of a particular planet on each of the signs , and the planet will affect each sign in different ways.Let 's say the day 's forecasts talk about a planet that 's currently in Saggitarius . In a Virgo forecast , this would affect the person 's home and family life , since Sagittarius is on usually on the cusp of the fourth house of a chart with Virgo rising . This forecast would only be relevant to people of *any* sun sign with Virgo rising , but not Virgos with a different rising sign . A person with Aries rising ( and *any* sun sign ) would read the Aries forecast . That same planet in Sagittarius would affect the Aries forecast differently : The forecast would likely describe travel , higher education , or religion , since since Sagittarius is on usually on the cusp of the ninth house of a chart with Virgo rising . This forecast would only be relevant to people of *any* sun sign with Aries rising , but *not* Aries people with a different rising sign.This is why you need to read the chart for your rising sign ( Aries ) , so that you get the correct effect of the planetary activity in question.Hope this helps .",0

"Which is the world 's oldest religion ? ? The world 's oldest religion , atleast chronologically from a historic perspective is Hinduism ( Sanatana Dharma ) . However , please keep in mind that everyone of every religion considers their religion to not be 'new ' . Christianity is seen as a fulfillment of prophecies based in Judaism . Baha'i is based upon prophecies in Islam . So as far as Judaism , Christianity , Islam , and Baha'i , if you ask a member of this religion they can each point backwards through the Abrahamic traditions to how each 'fulfilled ' other areas , thus keeping them within the same line . THe same can be said of Buddhism , Jainism , Sikhism , etc . So when asking this question it is best to be aware of what exactly you are wanting to know . As one Christian I know said `` Jesus was a part of God in the begining , thus Christianity is the oldest religion because Jesus was always a part of God , but it is young if you only compare it from a historic chronological perspective . '' I think that is well said.Thus from a Historice Chronological Perspective from oldest to youngest the religions go : HinduismZoroastrianismJudaismJainismBuddhismTaoismConfucismShintoChristianityIslamSikhismBaha'iNeoPaganism*Please note that many in the NeoPagan movement claim direct connection to the Pagan past and often direct it to a specific ancient culture/civilization , but not all . Some state that theirs is a new religion based upon a revitalization of ancient religions , but not the ancient religions themselves . So one has to be careful in this area , too . Native American beliefs and Shamanism are not listed , nor did I name Unitarian-Universalism , Rastafarianism , etc . I mainly listed major world religions . ( UUs do not necessarily view themselves as a religion in itself , but rather an approach to religion with many in a UU congregation holding a wide variety of beliefs from many of the worlds religions . There are some UU , though , who would claim that as their religion so no offense to those who do ) .",0

NAME : Rachel Carson BIRTHDATE : May 27 , 1907 BIRTHPLACE : Springdale , PA EDUCATION : 1925- entered Pennsylvania College for Women ( now Chatham College ) 1929- graduated with honors , earning a scholarship to continue her studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , MD . 1932- M.A . in Zoology from John Hopkins University . FAMILY BACKGROUND : The youngest of three children , Rachel Carson had a rugged upbringing in a simple farmhouse outside the western Pennsylvania river town of Springdale . She credited her mother with introducing her to the world of nature that became her lifelong passion . DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS : After completing her education , Carson joined the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries as the writer of a radio show entitled `` Romance Under the Waters , '' in which she was able to explore life under the seas and bring it to listeners . In 1936 , after being the first woman to take and pass the civil service test , the Bureau of Fisheries hired her as a full-time junior biologist , and over the next 15 years , she rose in the ranks until she was the chief editor of all publications for the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service . During the 1940s , Carson began to write books on her observations of life under the sea , a world as yet unknown to the majority of people . She resigned from her government position in 1952 in order to devote all her time to writing . The idea for her most famous book , Silent Spring , emerged , and she began writing it in 1957 . It was published in 1962 , and influenced President Kennedy , who had read it , to call for testing of the chemicals mentioned in the book . Carson has been called the mother of the modern environmental movement . DATE OF DEATH : April 14 , 1964 PLACE OF DEATH : Her home in Silver Spring , MD PORTRAYED BY : Celeste Earhart WEB SITES : Rachel Carson Homestead Rachel Carson Council Rachel Carson National Wildlife RefugeRachel Carson Forum - a center for `` new ideas and opinions about environmental issues facing Pennsylvania .

How does the Japanese manage to keep their race so pure ? About 99.4 % of Japan 's population is pureblood Japanese . Korea is around 99 % pureblood Korean also .

"what do i have to tell a broken hearted girl to encourage her to be as productive as she was before ? I think you should be commended for being s caring and considerate of this peson ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Rather than cause her grief by hounding her about her work , you 're trying to find a solution that fits her ... which would then help you as well . You 're putting her first . I 'm amazed and blown away by it . You 're a GEM of a person ! Sincerely.As I 'm sure you know tho , when it comes right down to it , and as unfortunate as it is ... ..time is the only cure for this affliction . It 's awful to go thru . Aside from that I 'm afraid all you can do is give her whatever she needs from moment to moment . We all deal with this differently . Sometimes one needs constant distraction ; friends , work , activities , etc . Other times it 's alone-time . Solitude to ponder , grieve , and wallow for a while . Figure out what this is for her , and maybe you can recruit some of the others to help , maybe without letting on what 's going on ( unless it 's obvious ) .I 'm guessing but it may be that the best thing all the way around is , that you take the hit and try to pick up her slack . It may sound like I am saying that in a very perfunctory manner , but it may just be easier for you ... .and she ... .that you help fill the void while she gets what she needs ... ..time.At the same time , she does need gentle reminding that she still has responsibilities to uphold . Perhaps if done right she may be able to use this as a crutch or distraction while she 's at work , and then use her home time to wallow , cry and be miserable.My best of luck to you .

"How do you make a USB drive bootable ? I have a Sony Micro Vault 256MB HDD ( the stick kind that plugs into the USB port ) I want to make this bootable so I can use it to dump pre-built images using ghost . I need to know how to get it to format with the system info so I can boot directly from the device . Your BIOS must support booting from USB devices . On system startup you need to get into your BIOS ( usually F2 - check manufacturer 's specification ) , and find where you can specify the boot order . Select a low-numbered boot order item , and set it to USB-HDD ( if availble , otherwise another USB option ) . This may require several attempts until the right device option is found.Since most USB drives are ATAPI-compliant , your BIOS should detect it as if it were an external USB hard drive.Just make sure you specify a boot order BEFORE your internal hard drive ( usually HDD , or IDE0 ) , otherwise your system will always boot to the hard drive.Also , you need to format the USB drive as a bootable drive . If you can get the system to boot from a DOS , Windows or Linux floppy disk , you can try installing DOS , Windows 95/98 , or Linux ( Win2000 , and WinXP require more than 256Mb for sytem files ) . Your system will likely assign the USB drive as the C : & # 92 ; drive ( MAKE SURE THIS IS THE CASE BEFORE FORMATTING ! ! ! ) .Keep in mind that most USB drives are slower than hard drives , so performance may not be up to par . The newer `` high-speed '' drives are faster , but not comparable to a real hard drive.If no options work , your Micro Valut may not be ATAPI-compliant , or it 's USB-HDD firmware may not be compatible with your system . I had this happen with a SanDisk Cruzer mini , but a PNY Attache worked.If I may make one suggestion as well ... make a bootable CD with your images instead . CD 's are much more rugged , and can not be accidentally erased . Duplicates are EXTREMELY cheaper ( about 5 cents vs. $ 20 ) than the USB drive solution . Many more BIOS ' support booting from CD ( for about 10 years now ) , so compatibility is usually not an issue . All of the commercial CD-burning packages ( including most of the LITE versions ) support making bootable CD 's . The only trick is to make a bootable floppy that it can use to create the boot image on the CD .",0

"`` Shalom `` . most famous Jewish word in the world . A friend told me that behind this word ; there 's a story ? I mean some Jewish got an explaination . Its not a `` Jewish '' word , its Hebrew ( our language ) for 'peace ' . What sort of story do you mean ? It is one of the ways we greet each other . Historically , when coming to a camp , we would greet the sentry with `` shalom aleichem ! '' or `` peace be among you '' , ( almost a question and statement at the same time ) and the appropriate response from the sentry would be `` aleichem shalom '' or `` among us , there is peace '' This lets the vistors know that everything is fine at the camp , and that they are welcome to enter the camp . This is how it was done back then , and that form of answering with the subjects reversed remains to be the appropriate greetingUpdate : Toda , toda . Beruch ti hiyeh ! Update : Technically SFederow . In the example I used the senrty is speaking for the camp in its singular entirety .

"when will the iraqi dinar gain in value ? In about 20 years when the country is finally able to start producing more oil than they are consuming . The value of the dinar is also dependent on many other things , like the actions of the Central Bank of Iraq . At present it has essentially a fixed value of 1477 dinars to the dollar . This value is being held fixed because all of the contractors working in Iraq need a stable exchange rate in order to operate . The value has not fluctuated by more than 1 % since the exchange began operating a couple of years ago . The Iraqi dinar probably has as much potential to lose value when it is finally traded on the open market as it does to rise . The Iraq economy will be oil-export dependent and at present Iraq is not producing as much oil as it was before the war . In fact much of the oil Iraq is presently exporting is being offset by imports of refined products like diesel and gasoline . Because oil production can not be increased under the present unstable conditions , it may be decades before Iraq becomes a significant oil exporter . Many of the wells in Iraq were permanently damaged by being shut down for the war . These wells will have to be redrilled or repaired and at present this is almost impossible . An oil rig makes a very vulnerable target and no oil company is going to risk its workers and assets on something that will become a target for bombers and snipers . It often takes years of planning to prepare for drilling an oil well , and then can take months or years to develop a new discovery . It could easily be 5 or 10 years before Iraq sees new oil production even it it starts tomorrow , and it wo n't . If you bought dinars I suggest you frame them and hang them on the wall . That may be their best use , since you ca n't redeem them at any bank outside of Iraq.Here is the link to the Central Bank of Iraq currency exchange : http : //www.cbiraq.org/cbs6.htm",0
"what is biotechnology and how it is used ? Biotechnology covers a wide range of uses , but I 'd say that mostly it 's about manipulating cells to express genes that we want them to express . This could be to make them produce industrial enzymes , designer agriculture , or biopharmaceuticals . the genetic code is pretty much universal , meaning we can take a gene from one organiand put into another to acheive specific results . Industrial enzymes can be used for anything from cleaning wastewater with special enzymes to degrade certain toxins , to making enzymes that breakdown starch into sugar for the production of ethanol for fuel , to the making of specific detergents . With agriculture , we can transfect plants with genes that make them more resistant to diseases or vermin , or more robust and able to grow under more varied claimates , or we can make food bigger or more nutritious . In biopharmceuticals , we address genetic disorders by creating the proteins that some people are unable to make for themselves , allowing them to lead more normal lives .",0
"we need more things to show awereness for autism ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ? we have all kind of famous people doing stuff for cancer aids stim cell research why can some one do some for autism ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I think there is a lot of awareness that there is a thing called autism . But people are woefully ignorant of what autism is like . I know I 've mentioned that my niece has autism & people have said things like `` Have you ever taken her to Las Vegas ? '' Then I have to explain that `` Rain Man '' was FICTION ! Even though the character was inspired by some real people , Hollywood got a hold of the script & had to exsagerate . And `` Autism '' can mean so many things , too . One of the questions here included a description of `` geeks watching Star Trek '' as autism . I guess they were refering to Aspergers . When I hear people saying things like `` Autism does n't need treatment or a cure '' I ca n't help but think they must be refering to Aspergers.Then there 's strict autsim . My brother would keep his baseball mitt mearby for when his daughter would have fits . He 'd use it to `` catch '' her head as she was trying to bang it on tables , walls , or the floor . Thankfully , she does n't do that anymore & she 's finally out of diapers ( at age 8 ) but hardly has any words . She can understand a lot , but ca n't color in the lines , much less , write ! Sometimes I think it is a mistake classifying Aspergers & `` strict '' autism under the same umbrella of `` Autism Spectrum Disorders . ''",0

"What is special about the number 1729 ? A Zeisel number is a square-free integer k with at least three prime factors which fall into the patternpx = apx − 1 + b where a and b are some integer constants and x is the index number of each prime factor in the factorization , sorted from lowest to highest . For the purpose of determining Zeisel numbers , p0 = 1 . The first few Zeisel numbers are105 , 1419 , 1729 , 1885 , 4505 , 5719 , 15387 , 24211 , 25085 , 27559 , 31929 , 54205 , 59081 , 114985 , 207177 , 208681 , 233569 , 287979 , 294409 , 336611 , 353977 , 448585 , 507579 , 982513 , 1012121 , 1073305 , 1242709 , 1485609 , 2089257 , 2263811 , 2953711 ( sequence A051015 in OEIS ) . To give an example , 1729 is a Zeisel number with the constants a = 1 and b = 6 , its factors being 7 , 13 and 19 , falling into the patternp1 = 7 , p1 = 1p0 + 6 p2 = 13 , p2 = 1p1 + 6 p3 = 19 , p3 = 1p2 + 6 1729 is an example for Carmichael numbers of the kind ( 6n+1 ) ( 12n+1 ) ( 18n+1 ) , which satisfied the pattern px = apx − 1 + b with a= 1 and b = 6n , so that every Carmichael number , you can construct with the formula ( 6n+1 ) ( 12n+1 ) ( 18n+1 ) , is a Zeisel number.Other Carmichael numbers of that kind are : 294409 , 56052361 , 118901521 , 172947529 , 216821881 , 228842209 , 1299963601 , 2301745249 , 9624742921 , ... The name Zeisel numbers was probably introduced by Kevin Brown , who was looking for numbers that when plugged into the equation2k − 1 + k yield prime numbers . In a posting to the newsgroup sci.math on 1994-02-24 , Helmut Zeisel pointed out that 1885 is one such number . Later it was discovered ( by Kevin Brown ? ) that 1885 additionally has prime factors with the relationship described above , so a name like Brown-Zeisel Numbers might be more appropriate .",0

If we apply logic to this , we can assume that since Mr. Red LOOKED at the man with the blue suit , so hence , Mr. Red is n't wearing blue , and since he ca n't wear his own color , then he must be wearing green . Following this , then , the man in the blue suit has to be either Mr. Green , or Mr. Blue . And since no one is wearing their own color , then Mr. Blue can not be the man in the blue suit , so that leaves Mr. Green to be wearing the blue suit . With only the red suit left to figure out , we then assume that Mr. Blue is the one wearing it !",0

"why there is 28 days on Feburary ? February is the second month of the year in the Gregorian Calendar . It is the shortest Gregorian month and the only month with the length of 28 or 29 days . The month has 29 days in leap years , when the year number is divisible by four ( except for years that are divisible by 100 and not by 400 ) . In other years the month has 28 days.February begins , astronomically speaking , with the sun in the constellation of Capricornus and ends with the sun in the constellation of Aquarius . Astrologically speaking , February begins with the sun in the sign of Aquarius and ends in the sign of Pisces.February was named for the Roman god Februus , the god of purification . January and February were the last two months to be added to the Roman calendar , since the Romans originally considered winter a monthless period . This change was made by Numa Pompilius about 700 BC in order to bring the calendar in line with a standard lunar year . Numa 's Februarius contained 29 days ( 30 in a leap year ) . Augustus is alleged to have removed one day from February and added it to August , ( renamed from Sextilis to honor himself ) , so that Julius Caesar 's July would not contain more days . However there is little historical evidence to support this claim.February was nominally the last month of the Roman calendar , as the year originally began in March . At certain intervals Roman priests inserted an intercalary month , Mercedonius , after February to realign the year with the seasons.Historical names for February include the Anglo-Saxon terms Solmoneth ( mud month ) and Kale-monath ( named for cabbage ) as well as Charlemagne 's designation Hornung . In old Japanese calendar , the month is called Kisaragi ( 如月 , 絹更月 or 衣更月 ) . It is sometimes also called Mumetsuki ( 梅見月 ) or Konometsuki ( 木目月 ) . In Finnish , the month is called helmikuu , meaning `` month of the pearl '' .February is recognized as Black History Month in the United States and Canada . `` February '' is pronounced without the first r , as `` Febuary '' , by many speakers . This is probably elision , or an analogical change influenced by `` January '' .",0

"Does size of the male member really matter and if so why ? What about other dimensions ? If we 're talking strictly about sensation produced during the act of intercourse , then it 's the circumfrence that is more important than the length as the sensation comes from friction and you need a larger circumfrence to enhance skin to skin contact to make friction.Too many men think it 's the length when their women are complaining to their women friends of cramping and pain because their man tried to jam it all up there.The other poster said it 's technique and this is also true because if you 've got a long one your woman will make excuses not to have sex if you do n't learn how to use it properly . How ? Ask her ! Do not deceive yourselves that we are not aware of your lack of expertise . But that does n't matter as long as you 're willing to talk about it and learn what we like and do n't like .

"Should the Phil . invest money donated by western countrries on developing on agri . area 's into industr'l zone ? *Economic Impact*Social and physiological needs*psychological impact*Advantage and disadvantage Investing money to develop agricultural areas into industrial zones is good -- -partly though.First of all , the Philippines is an agricultural nation . Perhaps some agricultural areas should be developed , but not all . Since it is an agricultural nation , it derives its economy from agriculture . If these areas will be developed into industrial zones , a good part of the economy will be crippled.Second , people who depend on agriculture for a living will lost their jobs . If their skills are only limited to agriculture , where will they go once these areas are industrialized ? Lastly , and this is just my opinion , if agricultural areas will be turned into industrial zones , and considering that the money comes from Western countries , the Philippines will then have a debt of gratitude to these nations . Meaning , its government will do whatever these nations will tell them to do . Another form of colonization , eh ?

"How do you like President Bush ? ? ? He 's a power hungry , cronyist puppet of the far right neocon movement . He 's a demagogue , and he is n't very smart . He thinks he 's above the law , he panders to the prevailing winds of evangelical Christianity even though the neoconservative movement stinks to Heaven of nihilism , egocentrism , atheism and cynicism.He is the choice of a party which tries to expound , at every opportunity , on the evils of big government and centralized social programs all while racking up a monsterous deficit on missile defense shields born of broken treaties . Upon breaking our nuclear proliferation treaties , we wonder why rogue nations in the rest of the world want to do the same . His spendthrift attitude is causing inflation , and it 's crowding much needed private investment out of our manufacturing sector . His failure to enforce the laws which keep the capitalist system of this country running have led to price gouging of fuels , and that 's compounding our economic troubles . Under his administration , we have made several cuts to energy subsidies for the poor ( which he promised not to do while campaigning ) , and in the face of his carefree attitude towards the illegal activities of the oil companies , people have frozen to death in their homes.The manufacturing in the military-industrial sector combined with a purely reactionary attitude towards environmentalism has led to a toxic level of perchlorates in the breast milk of almost ALL of the women tested for it . We ca n't even set up a control group because everyone is so laden with perchlorates . Perchlorates cause brain damage in nursing children.His budgets allocate federal funds for private , religious organizations.In violation of the due process of the law and our long held principles which prohibit unlawful search and seazure , he has the NSA spy on Americans and subpeonas search engines to find out what everyone in the country is searching for.He abandons science in favor of ideology . He refuses to heed the warnings of climatologists . His hostile attitude towards medicine and biology is threatening the very foundations of American industry , innovation and science . His cronies are trying to censor and suppress scientific journals which give sound evidence to something that should be intuitively obvious -- logging does n't help forests recover from forest fire.He was an alcoholic and a cokehead until he was 40 . His `` choice '' to become President was made when , according to him , he realized that he `` was 40 and wondering what to do with his life . '' He is in office only because Americans have strayed so far from their liberal founding principles that they would rather see a dynastic succession of aristocracy than a government of scholars and public servants.He abandoned Afghanistan , where the terrorists were and are , to take us to war in Iraq , where they are n't . He lied to do this . After doing that , his administration gave no-bid contracts to Halliburton , whose former CEO is now your vice-president . The price of doing this is that we are now unable to deal with a growing threat in Iran , and while only a few years ago we were berating the international community and the UN Security Council , the best we can now manage is to threaten to refer Iran to the UN Security Council.Under his administration , we have begun to use the CIA to fly people who are only suspected of something to old Soviet facilities where we torture them . We hold people for long periods of time without charging them with a crime.He pushed an energy bill through congress which relaxes the efficiency requirements for coal burning power plants . His reason ? To correct an impending energy crisis by making it worse . Companies wanting to build nuclear reactors are guaranteed a loan from the government to do so , they are no longer liable for nuclear accidents , and if their inspection process is halted for any reason , the government hands b",0

"which is a good album to start on the beatles ? i 've loved all of the beatles songs i 've heard so far and want to buy an album , but there 's so many and they 're all good ! which do i start with ? If you are a true beginner , the album `` One '' has all their Number One hits , and covers their career throughout . It serves as a good survey.If you think you will eventually get all their albums maybe you do n't want a greatest hits album like `` One . '' In that case I 'd think about what period Beatles you like the best and pick one of the following : `` Meet The Beatles '' ( very early ) ; `` Rubber Soul '' ( middle peroid , where things start to get more complicated ; `` Abbey Road '' ( late Beatles -- mix of stuff . ) In some ways Sgt .

"How many `` gifts '' of the spirit are there ? And what are they ! Can anyone tell me ? Alot of people have different views on this topic ! Read 1 Corrinthians ch.12 and get back to me on this The bible specifically mentions wisdom , knowledge , faith , healing , miricles , prophecy , descernment , tongues , interpretation , but gifts of the spirit are not limited to these only . The Bible also says every good thing comes from God . So a spiritual gift is any good thing a person can have ( All we have is given to us by God ) . So that can include talents , skills and other blessings . For example a person with musical talent has a gift of music , a being good with children would also be a gift . God gives us all kinds of gifts and they can all be used for His glory if we allow them to . vs. 12-31 goes on to talk about these gifts . Any gift can apply here .",0

"Are American Muslims sunnis , shias , or do they belong to other groups ? It depends my friend , If they immigrated from Iran or some parts of Iraq then they are probably Shias.If they come from the middeleast North Africa or elsewhere then defenitaley they are sunnis.Actually there are almost no other groups or let ` s just say that these other groups didn ` t spread outside the muslim countries , even their spreading in the muslim world is very limited.If you are talking about Americans who converted to Islam , also it depends upon the person who guided them to Islam but most probably they would be sunnis as the majority of the muslims are sunnis",0

"What is a dry joint in the circuit ? Half my monitor goes black and someone told me I had a dry joint in the circuit . Do I need a new monitor or can this one be fixed . A dry joint is a solder joint that has not been properly soldered , a solder joint being the connection of any of the electronic components to the main circuit board . A dry joint can be fixed using a soldering iron , and a bit of solder . Although you do have to know where it is , and be able to access that area . If you are lucky ( and have a friend with a soldering iron ) you might be able to find it , although I suspect it ’ s either going to be a trip to an engineer , or a new monitor .",0
"Why are so many blacks calling each other the N-word when they hate it so much ? Seems like a double standard. ? Even the mayor of New Orleans called it a `` chocolate '' city . From my perspective , it has nothing to do with any one person or group finding a term `` offensive . '' It has everything to do with wanting POWER.One form or POWER is the `` double standard , '' in which one group of people can engage in some activity or speech which another group can not . There have been double standards since the dawn of time , and to this day , you will hear women complain about the double-standards about men 's sexual behavior and their general assertiveness as compared to that of women . A newer incarnation of the double standard is political correctness , in which one group of people attempt to control and limit the words or thoughts of another.When one group can effectively limit the ability of of another to do the same , the first group `` feels '' a sense of control or power . I say `` feels '' because any such quest for power , based in the desire to forbid another person from saying a particular 6-letter word is a misguided and inconsequential exertion of power . it really changes nothing ( at least in the short term ) . About the only thing it accomplishes is inflicting a sense of guilt on the intended target . If you 're motivated by guilt , it has worked . In the scheme of things , it 's minor . You can choose to fight it if you want , but to do so involves incurring the wrath of a politcally-correct society , who has accepted , for whatever reason , the argument from the messenger that this restriction should be enforced , not legally , but socially , via scorn , derision and ostracization . That may mean losing friends , losing your job , or quite possibly losing points on Yahoo Answers ( or even your entire account ) .So that 's the way I see it . And If the people who are trying to control the speech , be they black or female , or whatever , really look at it objectively , they ca n't help but admit that there 's a grasp for a modicum of power involved .",0
"Are American Indians really sovereign , and should they be Americans ? If you call occupation of territory settled by people and taking their land while denying them their rights or even treating them as humans civilized I guess the US must be the most barbarious civilization there is . People have been condemning the Nazis for trying to wipe out the Jews , well the Americans have suceeded even more by almost wiping out an entire nation of cultured people who were long settled in the continent with their own culture , law and government . So yes technically American Indians or more precisely the various tribes are the first people here and thus should be sovereign and even ruling the white man not vice versa as it is . They have more right to be called Americans than the rat tag bunch of colonials that arrived here and started a wave of slaughter and massacres such as the force eviction of tribes along the trail of tears , force evacuation and settlement of reservations , gifts of smallpox infested blankets in an effort in biological warfare , broken treaties and senseless wars and killings .

"CAN ANYBODY CLARIFY ? If a person suffered from amnesia and then was cured would they remember that they forgot ? It is hard to say.The underlying cause of amnesia is critical to answer this question.If you are talking a traumatic event to the brain , then the memories could be permanetly lost . The physical structure of the brain could have been damaged beyond repair and the information contained there would be lost.Sometimes , the area is just injured and takes time to heal . In this case , over time the memories would begin to come back as the brain reroutes synapses to accommodate the injury.If it was a psychological amensia , then it may or may not come back depending on how the person can cope with the experience . In this case , there is usually very little physical brain involvment.In general , in a highly stressfulevent , adrenalize and stres hormones cause memory to be faulty at best . So in an crisis people rarely recollect events in the most accurate manner.For a whole lot of unsubsantiated opinion , see the Wikipedia entry : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmnesiaOr for Types of amnesia : http : //ahsmail.uwaterloo.ca/kin356/amnesia/amnesia2.htmlhttp : //www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php ? newsid=9673For a better reference check out http : //news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/a-b/167771.stm",0

"Does the Patriot Act Really Work ? What 's your opinion ? I think it 's a fallacy in the idea that the Patriot Act , or any other law , can actually stop criminals . The Brady bunch of laws has n't stopped a criminal from buying guns . Terrorists will find a workaround , too . The Patriot Act does n't even act as a deterrent . Remember , The 9-11 terrorists only had boxcutters , and I 'll bet they did n't bother to read any laws . The Patriot Act makes suspects out of honest people , and violates the rights of innocent people , the people that laws are supposed to protect . The Patriot Act is a perversion of the law . The President and all the rest of these public servants who act more like they are our rulers took an oath to uphold the Constitution , not disregard it , and not pass whatever laws they want as if the Constitution did not exist . What they do sounds more like treason to me -- or at least a great reason to kick them out of their offices onto their smug asses . Remember : the purpose of the Constitution is to protect you from your government . It probably works to some degree . We 've managed to prevent some terrorist actions as a result of it ... although at the expense of diminishing the authority of the U.S. Constitution.I 'm a believer in slippery slopes so I imagine the logical end to all of this is to preempt every potentially illegal action by putting the entire population of the country into prison ... just to be on the safe side .",0

"Who supports these liars in the White House ? Do you remember Lawrence Lindsey ? He was one of King George ’ s II economic policy advisor 's and Director of the National Economic Council from 2001 to 2002 . He was fired in 2002 after suggesting that the Iraq War would cost upwards of $ 200 billion . The official administration propaganda at the time said the war would cost $ 60 billion . They also said we would be greeted as liberators and showered with flowers.Mr . Lindsey was wrong . Congress has already appropriated $ 357 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan . Remember , these cost are on top of the $ 400+ billion a year we already spend on defense.It gets worse . According to a new economic study by Joseph Stiglitz , a former Chief Economist of the World Bank and a Nobel Prize winner in economics , the future cost of our current war/occupation will be between $ 1 trillion to $ 2 trillion.This nation spent $ 800 billion adjusted for inflation to fight the war in Vietnam . However this isn ’ t the true cost of a war . An additional $ 1 trillion was spent on Veterans benefits and interest payments after the war.What does this mean to you and your family ? It comes out to be about $ 19,600 per U.S. Household . That would have been enough to finance the shortfall in Social Security for 150 to 300 years . NO ! ! ! This is the same evidence I have used in recent months for reasons NOT to support the Iraq War . It gets worse friend.It seems that America 's continued interest in Iraq may have sparked a civil war for the `` democratic '' powers of the Iraq country . Now , America must spend billions more in building a better Iraqi military to avert any new war . This event continues to return again and again for the US.Let 's recall:1 ) The rebellion of US military forces in Mexico during the early 20th century.2 ) The resistance of American diplomacy in the Phillipines in 1898 . ( Imperialism ) 3 ) The disaster in Vietnam during the Nixon administration.The results always ends with American taxpayers paying for the problems that a Republican administration makes and the Democratic Party 's occupancy in the White House .

"Why do n't people stand upside down when standing on the South Pole ? If you define up as the direction towards the sky , and down as the direction a ball will fall when dropped , then there is no difference when you stand on the north pole , south pole or anywhere in between.The Earth is spherical so Earth 's gravity pulls in the same relative direction no matter where you are , down towards the center of the planet , so that makes down always towards your feet.And also since the Earth is spherical the sky will always be above your head , up . So there is no difference in upside down or right-side up based on where you are on the Earth .",0

"Learning english and need help with phrases ! ! ? Please help me with any of these questions！They are talking about horse racing.①man says : “ So I was wondering if maybe you needed some horses looking after．Pretty anxious to train again ” this man has a brokendown horse and he talks to , once was , his owner ( you ) . Does he means he is selling his horse and himself ? ②I 'm asking a job , I 'd even be willing to ... Cut my fee ? Does he mean it would be ok to have low payment if he get a job ? ③Yeah , I think I 'm gon na have to go with the second rule of horse racing . Never beat a dead horse.What is the second rule mean ? 1 . He appears to be asking the man if he needs someone to look after his horses . He is suggesting that he would like to do take this job as he is keen to get back into training horses which is what he has done before.2 . Yes . He is saying that he would be willing to accept less money than normal to do the job.3 . Beat a dead horse ( actually the real expression is - Flog a dead horse ) is an expression which means to do something which has no point because it is already settled . For example , if a child asked his mother for something and she said NO and would not change her mind , then to keep asking can be described as - Beating ( Flogging ) a dead horse . In your example it possibly is referring to the pointlessness of asking for work when none is on offer . But it is also meant to be funny in this case because the subject is actually about horses : - ) The expression probably comes from the pointlessness of beating a horse ( to make it work harder ) if it is dead ! !",0

"Can Bush realistically be impeached ? Can he ? Sure . All it takes is a majority vote of the House of Representatives.Will he ? Probably not - the Republicans control the House and Senate at the moment . Clinton was impeached when the opposition party controlled Congress.Keep in mind that impeachment does not mean removal from office . Impeachment is simply the process of charging the President ( or other positions like Vice-President or judges ) with high crimes or misdemeanors . Then the Senate acts as judge and jury to try the person . If they are convicted by the Senate , they are removed from office . Any criminal charges would then involve another trial after the person is out of office .",0

"Why do prisoners get to `` plea bargain '' for the crimes they chose to commit ? The way I see it , a woman does not get to say , `` Look , I really do not want to be raped , so can you just fondle me ? '' The clerk at the grocery store who is being robbed does n't get to say , `` I do n't feel like getting a serious injury or dying right now , so instead of shooting me in the chest or head , can you just shoot me in the leg ? `` So why do the criminals get to `` bargain '' and get to have the charges for the crime they committed made to be less than what they actually did ? It 's a very provocative question with a very mundane answer . I do n't think it 's fair either , but prosecutors sometimes need information about someone further up the line . If a rapist , for instance , also works with and has knowledge of a white slavery ring and can give credible testimony that will put the leaders and their underlings in jail a prosecutor may offer a lighter sentence in order to stop a larger criminal enterprise.The other reasons are more disturbing . Sometimes a prosecutor 's office is so overloaded that accepting a plea bargain is a way to make a dent in the case load that the office is carrying . Ideally , that would only occur with non-violent , first time offenders , but sadly that is not always the case.Finally , some victims are reluctant to testify or are so traumatized by the crime committed against them that they are unable to testify well and the D.A . 's office does n't want to risk an acquital . In this same vein are cases that can mount a credible reasonable doubt defense and cases where the evidence is weak or tainted.It a'int perfect , but its a better system than most others .",0
"Should n't the President be above Federal Law ? No , this would lead to abuse of power .

"If homosexuals were acceptable in society ... would they eventually die out ? Because if homosexuals were kept in the closet then they would be passing on their genes ... etc .

Your point is an interesting one : that gays currently have to pretend to be straight , and therefore they have heterosexual sex and reproduce , against their natural inclination . If they did not have to hide their sexuality , they would be much less likely to reproduce.The only weakness in your argument is the assumption that homosexuality is entirely genetic - this has never been proven .",0

The most powerful Islamic schools are there and people believe in Islamic leaders . Even when they were called for vote they got permission for it from their religious leader . They have been guards of many holy shrines there even before crusade wars . you ca n't tell them how to think about freedom , it seems they find clergy government more free than democracy and they are fighting for freedom.This is very important for US because of Domino theory which US hope to happen in middle east and all other countries there see what a beauty is Democracy in Iraq and try to have one but it will not happen , I think the second US leave the Iraq they will overthrow their government and make a new Islamic-Clergy type .",0

First Produced 1986 Eugene O'Neill Theater Center , Waterford , CT , USA > > > Published 1989 Dramatist Play Service , NY Genre Comic Folktale Parts Male 2 Female 3 Other Synopsis : Huey Maximilian Bonfigliano has a problem : While he is safely divorced from his shrewish first wife , Janice , who shot his dog and even took a bead on him , he feels he can not regain his `` manhood '' until he woos and wins her one more timeif only to put his broken marriage behind him once and for all . He enlists the aid of his lifelong buddy , Aldo Scalicki , a confirmed bachelor who tries , without apparent success , to convince Huey that he would be better off sticking with his new lady friend , Teresa , a usually placid young waitress whose indignation flares when she learns what Huey is up to . In a moonlit balcony scene ( hilariously reminiscent of Cyrano de Bergerac ) Aldo pleads his lovesick friend 's case and , to his astonishment , Janice capitulatesalthough not for long . However we do learn that her earlier abuse of Huey was intended to make him `` act like a man '' which , at last , he does . And , more than that , he ( and the audience ) become aware that , in the final essence , `` the greatestand onlysuccess is to be able to love '' a truth which emerges delightfully from the heartwarming , wonderfully antic and always imaginatively conceived action of the play .",0

The standard is from CD to 128 kbit/s w/ cd quality being 1400 kbit/s . To make smaller , you compress more and therefore take away quality ( details are taken out to compress . ) There are other compression formats to use , but by definition they all compress the info and therefore lose quality . Try 96 kbit/s and see if you notice a difference . ( This will be found in the recording media ; ie . the program that `` rips '' CD to mp3 . ) Again 128 is standard for not noticing quality loss .

"what does the government hide from the people ? Things that would harm the 'security ' of the government . Sounds nice , but in reality , they hide anything that would interfere with the status quo . Since they do n't want a wrong impression of what they have screwed up in the past , they hide pretty much everything they use to make decisions and the actions they take under the premise of 'the interest of national security ' . This could be technology which would help enemies ( so-called ; expanding who constitutes an 'enemy ' greatly expands what can be kept secret ) , anything that would ruin our economy or the main corporations which support it , anything that might reveal how our weapons work , policies about how things are REALLY kept secret , plans for keeping the government ( and friends ) safe after a major attack , strategic sources of materials which are n't publicly disclosed already , scientific data that might cause panic , scientific data that might cause distrust of the government , inventions which could be used as weapons ( yes , they monitor patent applications ) , and all the usual things like who is a spy for who , how we monitor communications , how other countries monitor our communications ( and sell us the info ) , how much money our intelligence agencies spend , and who in our country is suspected of being a threat to any of the above things.I think that pretty much covers it . If anything like paranormal activity , UFO 's , or antigravity technology falls under the categories above , welllllll ... .And do n't forget that they wo n't tell you if something they tell you is really false or misleading so that you do n't investigate something else they are hiding .

"Where , when , and why did the Holocaust happen ? Come on , if you are hoping for an easy answer to your homework , in several minutes you will have all the wikipedia links you could ever want on this subject . If you are hoping for non-attributable material in essay form , you wo n't get it here.Answers ... The Holocaust , meaning the Nazi German program to eradicate `` undesirable races '' like Jews , Gypsies and Slavs , happened primarily in what is now known as Poland and Germany , although one could argue that the round ups and other terror spread throughout most of occupied Europe.The rough period of the Holcaust varies depending on opinions . I rather believe it started with Kristalnacht on November 10 , 1938 and did n't end until 1945 with the final liberation . Survivors and their familes might tell you that they still suffer , therefore it has n't ended.Why is more complicated . I would read `` Hitler 's Willing Executioners '' by Daniel Goldhagen for a fairly succinct answer . However , it was the result of Nazi Germany 's effort to `` purify '' the `` Aryan '' ( what toff , as though they were Aryan ) race by killing off the so-called `` sub-humans '' .",0

"Is there such thing as a 'Dixie-crat ' anymore ? Is there a public figure who you would consider to be one ? DixieCrat was n't just a term meaning southern conservative Democrat , it was a real party ( it 's official name was the `` State 's Rights party '' ) formed as a 3rd party in 1948 , with Strom Thurmond as it 's presidential candidate . ( here was their official platform in 1948 , including segregation- http : //www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/dixiecrat1.html ) it pretty much fell apart after the 1948 election.Basically , a dixiecrat is a person that stands by the old line democrat platform of segregationist policies ( the Democrats used to be the conservative party , and the Republican party was the progressive party- this started to change between the election cycles of 1932 and 1940 with FDR ) - the dixiecrats were formed in response to Truman 's integration of the armed services and the overall democrat civil rights plank.Basically in answer to your question , no there really are n't any people around anymore that believe in the Democratic party but are against it 's policies .

"do u people think ice age will come back agein ? I have an MS in paleoclimatology , and I have to say that it is one of the most fascinating topics Ive ever delved into . It 's also amusing to see non-scientist 's responses here and on other message boards ! If you wanted to ask a scientist , you would have to define what you mean when you say `` ice age . '' There are varying degrees of `` ice ages . '' For brevity sake , I will assume you mean the relatively cold periods that last approximately 100,000 years that have dominated global climate for the last 2 million years . Contrary to popular belief , there are periods during the `` ice ages '' that are almost as warm as today.Based on paleoclimate evidence that suggest the ice ages have come and gone at least six times in the last 2 million years , the probability is that it will occur again.The difficult and possibly dramatic question is : when ? Seeing as though the last `` ice age '' generally ended about 12,000 years ago ( this is debatable , since there is no one date where everywhere across the globe it suddenly became warm ) , and the average interglacial is 10,000 years , we are overdue.Consider the widely accepted hypothesis that `` global warming '' -- whether it be natural , human-induced , or a combination -- can ultimately ( Ill spare you the details ) lead to an ice age . Melting polar sea ice , indicator species dying off in the tropics , large disintigrations of ice shelves in the Antarctic , estimations that global sea level may rise 4 inches in the next 100 years , `` wild '' weather in many parts of the US ... are these all tell-tale signs that we have already begun down the road to the next glacial period ? ! ? ! ? New-ish data suggest that past climates have changed rapidly -- like someone else mentioned either in this thread or another similar one -- several degrees Celsius in a matter of decades or less ! The great ice sheets that once reached as far south as Long Island and Iowa wont reappear for tens of thousands of years , but it could get chilly across much of the country real quick ! And possibly as soon as 2020 !",0

"I 've seen a 2 years boy playing good on PC , where will this young generation fly ... ? it was not a hard game , just a 2d kid shooter ... killing birds ... he know hot to get into the game and get out also ... what will our/new childs do @ that age ? ... I think there 's no limit to how quickly kids will learn to use and master the computer . I just hope there will be more tools available to help them grow their minds with them , and not just pacify them with games.With proper encouragment , kids will be able to more quickly learn essential skills like programming , graphic design and networking skills that will make them the next generation of innovators . It can also obviously aid them in developing more quickly in whatever other field of interest they may have.The obvious challenge is to create software that mimics games while teaching kids important concepts . Hand/eye coordination is n't enough ; they have to start to use their minds in a more critical and creative fashion . The software that can do that will have really achieved something for them , as well as for the rest of us .",0

"My friend is a marathon runner and he is getting cramps at mile 18 . What can he do ? He has run 4 marathons. ? Cramps are usually the result of mineral depletion . Others have advised about replenishing water and sodium , but overlook the importance of potassium , and , to a lesser extent , magnesium . While in training , he should have his potassium level checked to see if it is well within normal range ( 4.0 to 5.0 ) If not , he should ask his doctor about possible daily supplements . If it is normal , he should consider potassium loading before the race ( good foods include bananas , sweet potatoes , oranges ) and then supplementing during the race , either with pills ( preferably with a doctor 's OK ) , or , if his gastro system can handle it , orange juice or other high potassium fluids ; most sports drinks have only trace amounts of potassium . I 've run a few marathons and run at a relaxed pace , and thus it does n't bother my stomach to drink a quart of OJ an hour before the race and a pint at mile 14 ( supplied by a waiting family member ) , and this has helped reduce cramping a lot - I used to get severe charley horses at mile 19 . Tell your friend to search potassium loading on the web , there are a few references to it in marathon forums . The caveat is that a high potassium level is dangerous ; in people with normal kidney function , the kidney sloughs off any excess harmlessly ; but if renal function is impaired , high doses of potassium are contraindicated .",0

"Why is Seriana such a great movie ? Syriana is a political thriller directed by Stephen Gaghan . Gaghan wrote the screenplay , loosely based on the book See No Evil by Robert Baer . George Clooney stars and was one of the film 's executive producers ( along with Steven Soderbergh , Ben Cosgrove , and Jeff Skoll ) .The first scene in the movie is that of Pakistani immigrant workers boarding a bus to Iran to work in a Connex refinery . Later , they find out that they are being laid-off because of the loss of the bid to the Chinese , forcing them into poverty . This is where we meet the father and son ( Wasim Khan ) that will be central to this storyline.The movie 's title is somewhat ambiguous . Some have suggested that it comes from Pax Syriana , as an allusion to the necessary state of peace between Syria and the U.S. as it relates to the oil business . In a December 2005 interview , Baer told NPR that the title is a metaphor for foreign intervention in the Middle East , referring to post-World War I think tank strategic studies for the creation of an artificial state ( such as Iraq , created from the elements of the former Ottoman Empire ) that would ensure continued U.S. access to crude oil .",0

"what does center do really ? i 'm new to this sport but i like it very much.can anybody teach me a little Typically , the center is the tallest man on the floor . Traditional centers stay close to the basket on offense , where they can use their size to get good shots because they are so close . Often these are dunks , layups , put backs ( shots off of a rebound ) , or hook shots . They 're also expected to be the best rebounders , since they are taller than everyone else.On defense , centers again stay close to the basket because if a guard or forward gets around the person defending them , the center can still slide over and block or alter the shot ( since presumably , he is taller than the player trying to shoot ) . They are again expected to rebound.Non-traditional centers , particularly those from foreign countries ( no idea why ) , move farther from the basket to shoot . Some , like China 's Wang Zhu-Zhu , are actually good three point shooters . Having a center like this is sometimes considered an advantage , since traditional centers are not used to guarding a player far from the basket .",0

"can you tell me five facts about the violin ? i need some for a school essay The violin produces louder notes when the player either moves the bow faster or pushes down harder on the string . The two methods are not equivalent , because they produce different timbres ; pressing down on the string tends to produce a harsher , more intense sound.The location where the bow intersects the string also influences timbre . Playing close to the bridge ( sul ponticello ) gives a more intense sound than usual , emphasizing the higher harmonics ; and playing with the bow over the end of the fingerboard ( sul tasto ) makes for a delicate , ethereal sound , emphasizing the fundamental frequency.There are several methods of 'attack ' with the bow that produce different articulations ( 1 ) Détaché - The term détaché simply means ‘ separated ’ and it can be applied to any notes not linked by a slur . Stopping the bow on the string deadens the vibrations and thus creates a muted accent , elastic détaché which covered off-the-string strokes , and dragged détaché ( détaché traîné ) where smooth bow changes leave no audible gap between each note . Video Example of Detache . ( 2 ) Legato - Of successive notes in performance , connected without any intervening silence of articulation . In practice , the connection or separation of notes is relative , and achieved through the presence or absence of emphasis , Accent and attack , as much as silences of articulation ; degrees of connection and separation vary from legatissimo ( representing the closest degree of connection ) , tenuto , portamento , legato , portato , non legato , mezzo-staccato , Staccato ( the natural antonym of legato ) , to staccatissimo , and some of these terms have connotations going beyond simple degrees of connection or separation . ( 3 ) Sautillé - A bowstroke played rapidly in the middle of the bow , one bowstroke per note , so that the bow bounces very slightly off the string of its own accord . It is not indicated in any consistent manner : sometimes dots are placed above or below the notes , sometimes arrow-head strokes , and sometimes the stroke is simply left to the performer 's discretion . Spiccato and sautillé are sometimes used as synonyms , though Spiccato tends to be applied to a broader range of off-the-string strokes . Video Example of Sautille . ( 4 ) col legno - Occasionally the strings are struck with the back of the bow ( col legno ) . This gives a much more percussive sound , and is most effective when employed by a full orchestral violin section , since it produces little volume . ( 5 ) `` chopping '' - A more modern percussive technique , in which the hair near the bottom of the bow is struck against the strings . It is used by some jazz musicians , including the Turtle Island String Quartet .",0

"dealing with conceptual physics..where can i find help with my homework ? the question is ... the weight of the atmosphere above 1 square meter of the earths surface is 100,000 newtons . If the density of the atmosphere were a constant 1.2 kg/m3 , calculate where the top of the atmosphere would be . hecka hard ! ! ! any suggestions ? hecka ! ! damn . i miss california.what you have to do is realize that this question is asking about the volume of a rectangular shape that is 1 meter by 1 meter by X meters , where X is the height of the column.so , you know the density.. density is defined as mass divided by volume . and you know the weight.. which is mass times acceleration . here the acceleration is the acceleration of gravity `` g '' = 9.8 m/s^2 . so you can do a little algebra to get the equation volume = mass / density volume = weight / ( acceleration * density ) you know the weight ( 100,000 N ) , the acceleration ( 9.8 m/s^2 ) and the density ( 1.2 kg/m^3 ) . plug those numbers in and you get the VOLUME of the atmosphere , and since you know 2 of the dimensions of the box ( it is 1 square meter across the bottom face , remember ) you can figure out the 3rd pretty easily.since this is your homework i wont just tell you the answer , but you should be pretty much able to crank it out from here .",0

THIS IS THE ORIGIN OF THE CUSTOM : In English-speaking countries , it is common for at least one person to say `` Bless you '' after someone sneezes . The traditional explaination for the custom is that it began literally as a blessing . Pope Gregory I the Great ( 540-604 AD ) ascended to the Papacy just in time for the start of the plague in 590 AD ( his successor succumbed to it ) . To combat the plague Gregory ordered litanies , processions and unceasing prayer for God 's intercession . When someone sneezed , they were immediately blessed ( `` God bless you ! '' ) in the hope that they would not subsequently develop the plague.This custom persists among speakers of many languages . Common social responses to sneezes in English include `` Bless you '' and `` Gesundheit '' ( German , `` [ Good ] health [ to you ] '' ) .",0

"For what Antivirus used ? and what is the best Antivirus in the market ? Anti-virus softwares prevent your computer from receiving malicious scripts made by programming softwares , otherwise known as viruses . These viruses can do many things that can either be just a plain nuisance or something that can seriously damage your computer . I suggest not going without an Anti-virus software ; if you can find any software that 's legit , then use it . I personally like McAfee Anti-virus , because you receive updates quite often whenever you 're connected , and can actively stop Trojan Horse viruses and other malicious programs from executing on your computer . Plus , the interface is n't intimidating for a first timer .",0

"who is the president of armenia ? Robert Kocharian ( Armenian : Ռոբերտ Քոչարյան ) ( born August 31 , 1954 ) is the second president of the third republic of Armenia.Kocharian was born in Stepanakert , Nagorno-Karabakh , at that time a region of the Azerbaijan SSR . After becoming president of Nagorno-Karabakh in 1994 , he became Prime Minister of Armenia in 1997 . In April 1998 , he replaced Levon Ter-Petrossian as President of Armenia.He was a Communist Party official during the Soviet era but is no longer a member of any political party . Under Kocharian , Armenia has experienced stability and growth and the emigration rampant under Ter-Petrossian has been reduced . He has also taken a realistic stance in the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.His re-election during 2003 was marred by allegations of electoral fraud against both candidates , though most experts contend that any irregularities were not enough to sway the outcome . There were sporadic calls for Kocharian 's resignation in early 2004 with opposition-led demonstrators taking to the streets in support of demands for a referendum of confidence in him.Kocharian and his wife , Bella Kocharian , have three children .",0

True , in time you can find out but how are you going to handle it if you find that the person you 've been talking to is one of the `` old '' people you mention ? My best suggestion for you is to get out there & get involved in some hobbies , whatever they might be .

It 's all a matter of trust . Obviously if you are freaking out about this , there is something about him or about your relationship with him that is making you suspicious in this situation . Getting obviously angry with him when there is no proof of wrongdoing will only make him angry and defensive in return , and nothing positive can be accomplished when that happens . Express to him ( calmly ) how this made you feel -- if he is at all worth your time and energy , he will totally understand how uncomfortable this must have made you , and be willing to discuss the reasons why .",0

"why the police is not cancelling the driver 's lic of D U I ? Wow ! The police do not actually cancel the driver 's license . Not local police.The State Highway Patrol actually terminate your license . A court will normally decide on the suspension of a license for other than a non-payment of a annual license fee . The officer of the law simply writes the Citation , the `` Ticket '' . The State Police or Highway Patrol is the Agency responsible for the issue and control statewide for the license , and will simply carry out the orders of the Court . The `` Court '' is simply a Judge . Local Police do not ordinarily carry out these duties , but if a Judge so orders they will so act . Really nothing is unusual about it.So the Police Officer can give you a break only at the time when he is writing the Citation , or just prior to actual Court . Once a decision by a Judge has been rendered , it is out of the Officer 's hands . HE CAN NOT CANCEL ANYTHING ! APS",0

"What is a good gift for someone that just passed the BAR exam ? Any attorneys out there ... what were some of the gifts you received ? My good friends who passed the bar have received a wide variety of gifts.I got my best friend from college a bottle of Macallan 18 year old single malt scotch .

Most men will claim they are athletic or average frame when the picture clearly does not fit that range . Do they see it ? Probably not because men are taught as children to have high self esteem and just deal with it .

"would ypu prefer win 98 or XP ? It depends on 2 things : what kind of hardware you have and what sort of things you do with your computer.HARDWARE : It is safe to say that most PCs sold today can carry the weight of WinXP , plus the load of MS Office XP/2003 and browsing Internet . But if you are still using a 5 or more year-old PC with 128MB or less RAM , you are better off using Win98 . Another issue you might need to know is that whether the PC comes with any USB socket ( which is very common nowadays but not before 2000 , not in developing countries anyway ) and whether you want to use it if it does have one . WinXP makes it easier to use USB devices , whereas Win98 does not comes with any USB driver . ( A 3rd-party native USB driver for win98 can be found at http : //rapidshare.de/files/1217842/nusb22e.exe.html ) WHAT YOU DO : First off , if you are to play any current PC games , go for WinXP . If you are to do any kind of graphics intensive applications like any of the Adobe family software , video editing and encoding , CAD/CAM system , etc. , all of which require a lot of memory size , go for WinXP ( since it can address a higher RAM size ) . If you need an EASY ( without installing any 3rd-party driver ) way to transfer files from and to USB devices ( like flash drives , digital cameras , mobile MP3 players , mobile harddisks , etc . ) go for WinXP . If you only need it for typing some documents/letters , browsing the web , and listening to audio CDs , you can stick with Win98 . If you have some legacy software written to run on Win98 only ( such as customised accounting package ) , stick to Win98.Of course there are many other more specific issues can be considered , but the above can serve as a basic guideline . I hope this help .",0

"why are you a Christian ? honestly I was introduced to Christianity growing up , but that is n't why I 'm Christian . It is very obvious to me that someone had to create the world and universe . So many wonderful miraculous things happen to people that can not be explained by logic , or natural order . Even the complexity of natural order is too vast to be by impossible chance . This led me to know that there is a Supreme Being.As for why Christianity , there are a couple of reasons . The Bible has never been proven inacurate , which supports the fact that it is divinely inspired . Some good/interesting books about this topic are written by Lee Strobel `` The Case for Christ '' `` The Case for a Creator '' and a couple more . Even when the Bible has n't been believed , someone has come across ruins that disproves man 's theory , and inforces that the Bible is right . Creation interpretation of data makes sense to me , and having the world be ~6000 years old gets rid of lots of problems ( like there should be billions more people on the earth if it has been around for millions of years , the fact that trees that are buried in layers supposedly thousands of years apart should have rotted , not nearly enough fossils- let alone NONE that are inbetweens , etc ) . These are physical external reasons to me.There is also a much more important internal aspect to why I allow Christ to rule my life . Reading His Word , applying His principles ( which never contradict each other ) , and knowing that someone always loves me no matter how much I screw up has made a difference in my life . This change is so real that I can be certain of God , His Son , and the Holy Spirit . I now never have that 'does anybody care ? ' empty feeling , or the 'why am I even here/what is the point of existance ? ' attitude . This does not mean that I have the perfect life , and all is sunshine . I sometimes have down days , I still get frusterated at times and ask why , but there is always an instruction manual to go to , and He is always with me . That is a very comforting thought , that the God of the entire universe specifically loves me , cares about me , listens to me whenever I take the time to talk with Him , and can change my attitudes and bless me . How wonderful !",0
"Why do girls with a boyfriend complain about their man to other SINGLE guys that are interested in them ? Girls love to be proud of their guy , and tell the world how great he is . If a girl is actually complaining about her man , it means that she wants you to know she 's not entirely happy ... and usually this means she 's interested in your opinion ( or in you , but this may not have even occured to her yet ) . ... if you 're the single guy she 's complaining to , well - this all sounds great . Problem is , you 'd be getting her on a rebound call , and that 's no good . I 've been there ... a number of times , and while I ca n't say with honesty that it wo n't work 100 % of the time , I also ca n't imagine it works very often at all .",0

"Why is DSL never available in my area ? Why is DSL never available in my area ? DSL has a distance limitation , and this is most likely the reason it 's not available in your area ( it 's not available in my neighborhood either ) . For DSL to work properly you have to be less than 18,000 or so wire feet away from your telco 's central office . If you are too far away they wo n't offer it . There are technologies to extend it , however , most of the telco 's ( Verizon and AT & T ) are switching to fiber networks . Verizon is going to go with fiber to the home and AT & T with fiber to the node . When those roll outs are finally completed , you 'll probably be able to get vdsl ( very fast dsl ) in your area . Might take a few years though .",0

"How did Dinosaurs died ? So much of them around the world . How could all of them die in one sweep ? Why did all of the remaining dinosaurs die out suddenly at the end of the Cretaceous period ? There is a short answer and a long answer to this question . 2 Here is the short answer . No one knows for sure . 3 Here is the long answer . There are a number of theories . Some are scientific , and some are ridiculous . Most scientists believe in one or two main ones , but no one knows for sure . 4 The reason no one knows for sure is because the whole thing happened about 65 million years ago . No one was around to see or hear what was going on back then , and no one was around to keep records . 5 What we do know comes mainly from fossil records . Scientists study the fossils themselves , and they study the rock in which the fossils are found . Fossil records have n't given us definite proof for any one theory . This is because there are some problems with fossil records . For one thing , most fossil evidence of dinosaurs has been found in North America . We do n't know as much about dinosaur activity on other parts of the earth . Another problem is that it is very hard to date fossils . Dating fossils means determining how old they are . 6 One really interesting thing about the big dinosaur question is that scientists from many different fields are working to solve the problem . Astronomers , physicists , geologists , paleontologists , ecologists , chemists , geologists and others are all gathering evidence , experimenting , and researching to try to solve the puzzle . 7 The most popular theory is called the Alvarez Hypothesis . This hypothesis says that , 65 million years ago , a big asteroid hit the earth . This asteroid crash scattered dust high up into the atmosphere . It blocked much of the sunlight and caused the earth to become cooler . The crash also started huge fires , high winds , and violent storms that killed some of the dinosaurs . The lack of sunlight and warmth caused many plants to die . This shortage of plants for food caused the rest of the dinosaurs to die out . 8 The second most popular theory says that activity on the earth itself caused the extinction . As the supercontinent of Pangaea was breaking up , movement of the earth 's giant land plates caused volcanoes to erupt and the climate to change . These changes affected the earth 's atmosphere and temperature , and the dinosaurs died out from the cold or from lack of plants to eat . 9 Other theories suggest that dinosaurs became so big that they could n't move , or that there were too many dinosaurs and they ate up all of the food .",0
"Is it better to go away for college or stay near home ? If I went to college nearby I 'd still live on campus and have my own life for the most part but still see old friends , family , etc . Or is it better to go away for college and start all over ? It 's a matter of personal preference . If you want to go away for the experience or to a particular college away from home then you should go for it . On the other hand if it really does n't matter , some colleges closer to home can be less expensive . Either way you 're starting a new journey and hopefully you 'll get the most out of it .",0

"Why Muslims do n't condemn the threats of Islamists to kill the danish cartoonists ? Iread today and i was upset that a Pakistani cleric promised bounty on the head of the cartoonist . like living in middle-ages or stone-ages where ppl got bounties on their head because of their opinion . of course there are more than one , but the cleric , as usual as many clerics , is ignorant probably took his information from somewhere : '' He said the mosque and his religious school would give $ 25,000 and a car , while a local jewelers ' association would give another $ 1 million . No representative of the association was available to confirm it had made the offer . `` This is a unanimous decision of by all imams ( prayer leaders ) of Islam that whoever insults the prophet deserves to be killed and whoever will take this insulting man to his end , will get this prize , '' Qureshi said . `` http : //news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060217/ap_on_re_mi_ea/prophet_drawingsWhy do n't you if you muslims do n't condemn such act openly ? if you are non-Muslim , how can we protect those innocent cartoonists ? To answer your original question , it is because Islam will NOT hold their fellow Muslims accountable for their actions.When asked of a Muslim , why doesn ’ t the Islamic majority in the United Nation condemn the thousands of terrorist acts perpetrated by those of your faith ? The answer comes back , “ We can not judge our Muslim brothers . Only Allah can judge them. ” Yet when it comes to judging the infidel , there are no holds barred . Now , let us contrast this attitude with what the Bible teaches.1 Corinthians 5:11-13For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside ? Do you not judge those who are inside ? But those who are outside God judges.This is the polar opposite to Islam . The Bible teaches that the Christian is to judge the actions of other Christians and call them on the carpet if they are doing ANYTHING unbiblical . However , those who are NOT believers , the Christian is to leave alone , that only GOD will judge them.So there is the contrast . If Islam was really concerned about peace , and was a peaceful religion , they would do something to stop these violent people . But do n't hold your breath .",0

"Why US try to develop a democratic power in IRAQ when they will never be a democratic nation ? Who is to say that IRAQ will not be a democratic nation . Even the USSR was democratic in the truest sense and meaning of the word , the people could vote , problem was there was only one person they could vote for.Oil has NOTHING to do with the war in IRAQ . I wo n't even get into why but the war would be in Saudi Arabia where the oil reserves are over twice the size of Iraq.We need to look back in history to see what has happened and the future looks bright for IRAQ . Success in Central America , Liberia , Korea , the new Russia , the slavic regions , and others have formed some type of democracy.The `` democracy '' that other countries enjoy are definately not the same as ours , but even a Monarchy like Morocco has a democratic government.Success in IRAQ will indeed depend on whether democracy becomes the new form of government when America finally does pull out or if there will be political chaos and insergency.Time will only tell.To correct a couple of the other writers above me ... The United States is NOT a democratic country , it is a Federal Republic . If indeed we were a true democracy Gore would be president not George Bush ( Gore won more of the popular vote but less of the electoral vote ) . So to say the US is the most democratic country in the world is absurd . Correct me if I am wrong but there is no country in the world that is truely democratic .",0

The big difference between Earth and space is that our atmosphere reflects the light that goes through it . So it makes our surroundings seem brighter .

"who is guru ? The syllable gu means shadowsThe syllable ru , he who disperses them , Because of the power to disperse darknessthe guru is thus named.A guru ( गुरू Sanskrit ) is a teacher in Hinduism , Buddhism or Sikhism . Based on a long line of philosophical understanding as to the importance of knowledge , the guru is seen in these religions as a sacred conduit , or a way to self-realization . In India and among people of Hindu , Buddhist , or Sikh belief , the title retains a hallowed meaning.Guru also refers in Sanskrit to Brihaspati , a Hindu figure analogous to the Roman planet/god Jupiter . In Vedic astrology , Jupiter/Guru/Brihaspati is believed to exert teaching influences . Indeed , in many Indian languages , such as Hindi , the occidental Thursday is called either Brihaspativaar or Guruvaar ( vaar meaning period or day ) .In contemporary India and Indonesia , Guru is widely used within the general meaning of `` teacher '' . In Western usage , the original meaning of guru has been extended to cover anyone who acquires followers , though not necessarily in an established school of philosophy or religion . In a further metaphorical extension , guru is used to refer to a person who has authority because of his or her perceived knowledge or skills in a domain of expertise.The importance of discerning between a true guru and a false one is explored in scriptures and teachings of religions in which a guru plays a role . The assessment and criticism of gurus and the Guru-shishya tradition are espoused in the discourse about cults and new religious movements by Western secular scholars , theologians , anti-cultists and by skeptics both in the West and in India .",0

"what 's the difference between sephardics and ashkenazies ? and their origin ? Askenazim are Jews whose ancestors migrated to Northern and Western Europe in the Middle Ages , especially to France and Germany . Due to expulsion from the former and persecution in the latter , they largely moved to Eastern Europe , especially Poland/Lithuania , which was an enormous and powerful country in Renaissance times . They spoke a German dialect that eventually evolved into the Yiddish language . Sephardim were decended from Jews who lived in the Iberian peninsula when it was ruled by the Moors . They were expelled from Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella and moved eastwrd to Greece , Turkey , the Balkans , and other lands . They spoke an archaic Spanish which later became Ladino . Lately , Asian Jews whose ancestry was never European and who had lived in places like Iran since the Roman Diaspora have also started being referred to as Sephardim .",0
"is there any care or prevention for demintia or alzymers disease ? I have heard that using your brain more can help delay or prevent Alzheimers , though not scientifically proven . Puzzles like Mensa , Soduku , brain teasers may help.Efforts to find effective treatments for Alzheimer 's after-the-fact have so far been disappointing . Age is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer 's . The baby boom is approaching its golden years . Indeed , much of the concern about the solvency of governmental social safety nets is founded on estimates of the costs of caring for baby boomers , assuming that they develop Alzheimer 's in the same proportions as earlier generations.One study ( `` Leisure Activities and the Risk of Dementia in the Elderly , '' New England Journal of Medicine [ 8 ] ) found that people who played chess on a regular basis went on to get Alzheimer 's at a substantially lower rate than the general population . The chess relationship was stronger than any other factor , including dancing and solving crossword puzzles , both of which were also shown to be inversely proportional to getting Alzheimer 's disease.In a number of retrospective studies , regular physical exercise has appeared to be inversely related to the development of Alzheimer ’ s . The Alzheimer 's risk of those exercising regularly was half that of the least active . This research is consistent with the observation that virtually all measures designed to promote cardiac fitness and reduce stroke risk also seem to reduce Alzheimer 's risk . However in one study , dance appeared to be the only exercise effective in reducing risk . One explanation is that dancing requires the use of complex mental skills such as performing correct steps while at the same time keeping track of the music . The presence of cardiovascular risk factors -- diabetes , hypertension , high cholesterol and smoking -- in middle age ( ages 40 to 44 ) was found very strongly associated with late-life dementia ( Neurology 2005 ; 64:277-281 .

"What is the meaning of the English soccer term `` cup-tied '' when applied to an individual player ? Cup-tied is an adjective , used primarily in football ( soccer ) , used to describe a player who is ineligible to play in a knockout cup competition after transferring from another club during that competition.In virtually all domestic and international cup competitions , any player who makes an appearance for a club at any stage of the competition is `` tied '' to that club for all future matches during that season in the same competition . This prevents a strong team from gaining an unfair advantage by signing a talented player from a club that has lost in an earlier round . A team that wishes to transfer a player may deliberately choose to keep that player off its cup roster to ensure that he is not cup-tied , increasing his usefulness to a club that may be involved in the same competition . A recent example of this was Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez ' decision to keep Milan Baroš off Liverpool 's roster for their 2005-06 UEFA Champions League ties in order to retain his value to clubs interested in purchasing the Czech striker 's services . ( Baroš eventually moved to Aston Villa , which was not involved in the Champions League . ) Similarly , although far less often , a team may deliberately cup-tie a player to discourage a transfer during that season . Note , however , that this does not restrict most international transfers ; cup-tying is only an issue internationally if both teams involved in the transfer have participated in a continental cup competition such as the UEFA Champions League or UEFA Cup .",0

"what is the relation between feng shui and architecture ? Feng Shui is a science , based in numerology among other factors as the 5 elements ( Fire , Wood , Water , Metal & Earth ) the 8 cardinal directions and the application of many other formulas.According to Feng Shui we all have a Kua number , this number is determined by your date of birth . Each kua number has 8 directions , we all have 4 good directions and 4 bad directions . Also the date of building is very important , that way one can know in which period the house is being built or was built , right now we find ourselves in period 8 ! Let 's say U want to built a house and your very best first direction is North , then U will orientand design your home plans according to these directions . A total Feng Shui house can be design by this Kua number and also with the help of different formulas e.g Land Scape Feng Shui,8 Mansions , Flying Star , Etc.Plan the layout of a house by identifying the good sectors and not so good sectors after examining the flying star natal chart of a house . Identify if there are any specials such as parent string combinations in your flying star chart , and plant to augment their good luck by incorporating an open-spaced concept within your house . Then work with shapes when activating the feng shui of the different sectors of your house.Actually Feng Shui is becoming more and more popular with the years and many architects are already working together with Feng Shui Consultants to design floor plans of a house , building or residential complex ! Many celebreties follow this science , e.g . Donald Trump !

"How can I get back together with my ex-wife ? Our split up was due to a really bad situation . No adultery involved . However the tust was shattered ! Not knowing the details , it is tough to answer , but there are various types of women out there , and for some , trust is everything . If you did enough to make her leave you , it must have been pretty bad . I would assume ( since I do n't know the circumstances ) that either there have always been trust issues , or that your infidelity ( of whichever type ) was long standing and ongoing , and so she felt betrayed . In both cases , I do n't know if there is anything you could do . If she left because of pure emotional reaction , you might have a chance , but if it was an intellectual decision , it is not likely to work . Emotion can be reasoned with - an overreaction can be dealt with , but logic is usually rock solid . You could offer therapy for you both , however if you are already 'divorced ' , it seems a little too final to try that . Apologies alone wo n't really get you anywhere . Not much of an answer , but without any details , it 's the best I 've got . My main advice though is to know when to give up . Some battles ca n't be won .

"How do we use the matter waves of the electrons in an electron microscope ? Teacher said electrons are waves ( DeBrolie ) and we computed wavelength of an electron moving fast . He said electron microscope use electron waves to see tiny things . I asked if the matter waves were electromagnetic . He said no they are matter waves . I asked if they are not electromagnetic how can we observe them in a microscope . He said ... he did not know . Could you please help me ? An electron microscope bounces electrons off of things , captures them as they bounce off and then resolves a picture from the distribution of electrons that have returned . This is the same way a light bounces off stuff and we capture the reflected photons to make a picture with our eye . We cant see electrons with our eyes , though , so we need a machine to collect the scattered electrons and a computer to put an image together based on how the electrons scattered . The reason electrons can be used to see smaller things is that they have a `` shorter wavelength '' than visible light . The debroglie wavelength is n't a complete description of the wave properties of an electron or pohoton , but it is a good way to approximate many things . The wave function that describes an electron or a photon , or anything else is NOT a `` matter '' wave . That is a poor description . The wave itself is related to the probability that you will find the electron at a certain point in space , or with a certain property like velocity or spin . Your teacher is correct in saying that the electron is a wave , this wave can tell you the probability of measurements coming out a certain way , but the electron does not have characteristics like position or velocity UNTIL you measure them . Back to your question . As you know the debrolie shortens when momentum goes up . A shorter debrolie wavelength means that the electron is generally more localized than photons , which have relatively small momementums . If you want to bounce particles ( electrons of photons ) off say , two atoms separated by 1nm , the particle your sending toward it needs to be localized enough ( have a short enough wavelength ) so that it hits only one , and not both of them . A green photon would come waving in , hit both , and as it came back , the wave would be spread out so much that you could find it anywhere , and you couldnt make a picture of the two atoms no matter how many photons you bounced off of them . If you use electrons though , their wave function could be localized to bounce of only one or the other and based on where you measured it when it returned , you could use the information to resolve an image of the two atoms . This same idea is why you cant ( I 'm pretty sure ) resolve the image of the lunar landar on the moon with visible light . By the time the photons get back here from the moon , their wave functions have spread out to cover too large an area , and we cant tell exactly where they came from , resulting in a fuzzy , non-detailed image .",0
"Do you know when the Stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh will be repatriated to their homeland Pakistan ? http : //www.nation.com.pk/daily/july-2005/26/localnews3.php Petition seeking Biharis repatriation sent to CJBY OUR STAFF REPORTERLAHORE - The petition earlier moved to seek repatriation of Biharis ( the stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh ) was sent to the Chief Justice Lahore High Court on Monday when Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed , sitting with Justice Muhammad Muzammal Khan on the bench , refused to carry on with hearing of the petition , contending that he , as a lawyer , had appeared amicus curea in the matter . The petition filed by advocate M.D.Tahir for the said reason was sent to the Chief Justice , requesting him to reconstitute the bench.The petition pertains to 0.24 million people who fought shoulder to shoulder with Pakistan army in East Pakistan in 1971 war and were got stranded in Bangladesh after Dhaka Fall .

"how does the earth rotates itself ? Our solar system- the Sun , planets , Kuiper belt and Oort cloud , everything orbiting the sun even many times further than the orbit of Pluto- is thought to have condensed from a vast cloud of interstellar gas some billions of years ago when that cloud was shocked or squeezed by a supernova explosion . The dust and grains that condensed out of the cooling solar gas aggregated to form larger fragments of rock . Chondritic meteorites are basically just such collections of grains and fragments that have been compacted together to form a larger piece of rock and eventually small planetary bodies . Such bodies are termed planetesimals when they become roughly as large as asteroids ( several kilometres to a few hundred kilometres in dimension ) . The larger they grow , the greater the gravitational attraction that the planetesimals exert and hence the more effectively they sweep up additional particles and rock fragments while circling the Sun . ( Britannica CD ) Because that initial shockwave came from a particular direction and because the cloud was not of uniform density , the particles had a net rotation around their center of gravity . Humans subsequently identified that direction as `` counterclockwise as viewed from above the north pole of the sun '' . As the bodies of the solar system grew by accretion , particles swept up from different distances from the center of gravity ( the sun ) had different orbital velocities . Analogously , water swirling down a drain moves slower further and faster closer to the center . Galileo and Newton showed that rotational energy is conserved : The sun and planets ‘ inherited ' their spin from the orbits of their constituent particles , so to speak . Today , some five billion years later , all that rotational energy is still conserved in the rotations and revolutions of the bodies of the solar system . Our solar system is not unchanging , though . Because of gravitational interactions between moons and their planets , between the planets , meteors and comets themselves and interactions between the solar wind and the magnetospheres of the planets , rotational energy is still be ‘ traded ' back and forth : Mercury orbits in a 3:2 resonance with its rotation , our day is getting longer while the moon only shows one face towards us , the rings of the gas giants are temporary phenomena , ... But that 's another story.In other words , An act of GOD",0

"Have you ever had your handwritting analyised ? I wanted to see if i could get some opionons on handwriting analysis . have you had yours done ? was is accurate ? i have been studying it for a while now and i have been thinking about getting certified and doing it for money , but i dont know if there is a real market for it . by the way , im always practicing , so i would be amiss if i did n't offer to do yours for free . if you havent had it done , im always looking for practice . just scan a sample of your cursive handwriting and signiture to mr.robwallace @ yahoo.com the more letters the better . it doesnt have to say anything in particular , just thought i would offer that for those who were curious . or you can go to handwritingwizard.com this is where i discovered handwriting analysis . okay , thanks for your feelings on this and/or graphotherapy . I hope this doesnt seem like an advertisment , im just get excited about things like this . No offense intended , Rob , but `` Graphology '' is a pseudoscience . There is nothing one can learn about your personality from looking at handwriting . ( Well , unless you always put down `` Kill the authorities ! `` ) The extent to which it works is when the analysis contains a number of vague generalizations that are generally positive . This is called the Forer Effect . The very same advice can be given to hundreds of people and they will each think it applies to them.Try this - if you believed in graphology and got this answer back would it apply to you ? Virtually all people say yes - making the whole thing meaningless. -- -- -- -- -- -- -You have a need for other people to like and admire you , and yet you tend to be critical of yourself . While you have some personality weaknesses you are generally able to compensate for them . You have considerable unused capacity that you have not turned to your advantage . ou also pride yourself as an independent thinker ; and do not accept others ' statements without satisfactory proof . But you have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others . -- -- -- -- -- -- -There have been literally hundreds of scientific studies of graphology and the net result : nada .",0

"Which is better , AMD or Intel ? I know for a fact that AMD is much better than Intel ! AMD 's processors run a lot faster and cooler . A cooler running processor is important . Not only does it mean that AMD processors have a faster clock speed than comparable Intel products but AMDs also have a longer life expectancy as well . Plus AMD costs quite a bit less than their Intel counterparts . AMD is also ahead on the technology curve as well . They were the first company to introduce the 64-bit PC processor many months ahead of Intel ’ s 64-bit processor . This is why I believe that AMD will possibly out live Intel.I 've had both brands and nobody can even come close AMD ’ s speed and power ! I am running a newer AMD Sempron 3000+ with 512 MB of memory and Windows 2000 Professional SP4 for my operating system and this combination works great.From now on AMD , is the only processor for me . This is just my honest opinion . And no , I do not work for or get any gratuity from AMD for saying this .",0

"how does one learn to swim well ? I can manage to go swim about 20 mtrs but i am exhausted and cant go any further . Can someone point me to good online swimming lessons and techniques for amateurs . If you are trying to swim freestyle ( crawl ) , switch to an easier stroke , like the sidestroke while you increase your endurance . If you can only swim 20m , then swim 20m , rest , and swim 20m again . Repeat that process . You can time your rests and shorten your rests as you get stronger and increase the number of repititions you do each session . After a while , push yourself to do 40m between stops , then 60 , etc.In my experience , if you can work up to 400m without stopping , you will be past the point where you are struggling in the water.It might be a good idea to have someone look at your stroke and tell you what needs correcting . If you are struggling to make 20m . there are probably a lot of things that you can do to make your stroke more efficient . Find out what they are and work on correcting one thing at a time . Find someone who 's swimming laps when you are at pool , someone who 's stroke looks good , and ask them to look at your stroke . Ask them what the worst thing that you are doing and what they think you should do about it . You 'd be suprised how many people would be happy to help you .",0

"why is glucose highly reactive in oxygen gas ( at 37 degree celcius ) in the biological systems ? the same mixture of glucose and oxygen gas is stable outside the biological system . does the compex order of the biological system one of the reasons ? Biological systems have enzymes ( and a handful of other reagents ) which will use O2 and sugar to make energy -- specifically , hexokinase ( HK ) , phosphoglucose isomerase ( PGI ) , phosphofructokinase ( PFK ) , aldolase , triose phosphate isomerase ( TIM ) , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) , phosphoglycerate kinase ( PGK ) , phosphoglycerate mutase ( PGM ) , endolase , and pyruvate kinase ( PK ) . The process undergone is called glycolysis . The result is that glucose is consumed , making two pyruvate molecules ( which in some systems can then enter the Citric Acid Cycle aka Kreb 's Cycle ) and ADP is turned into ATP , which is an energy source.And after memorizing this and subsequently forgeting all this useless detail some years ago , I nearly ralphed on my book reading this just now . Bad memories .",0

"is a mp3 better than an i-pod ? In my opinion , i would think that an MP3 player is better than an iPod . i have several of reasons why.1 . There are pretty much two formats that will work on MP3 players : MP3 and WMA . On iPods , you can only download one format that you ca n't actually listen to on your computer.2 . For an iPod , you have to buy music off an online store . for an MP3 player , if you own the music , you can put it on the MP3 player.3 . iPods tend to cost WAY more than MP3 players.4 . the only reason why iPods are more popular is because that they have good ads and word of mouth got around fast.so , if you are only going to be using it for listening to music , an MP3 player would be better . Likewise , there are things that an iPod can do that others ca n't . iPods generally hold a lot more songs than MP3 players . also , the new iPods can download videos onto them , so you can actually watch music videos on your iPod ! you can also look at picture slideshows on your iPod as well.so , in conclusion if you do n't want to spend as much and you only want to listen to music , choose an MP3 player . if you want to view music videos and pictures , choose an iPod.hope i helped !",0

"Can a 14 year old talk to a 18 year ? If i 'm going on 14 and i want to talk to and 18 year older and we began to talk , what do you think would happen . I would strongly challenge the 18-year-old ( or older ) who would even talk with you , other than standard polite social acknowledgement . Someone who would provide mentorship is an obvious exception , but that is not how I understand the nature of the question . Since this question is in the `` Love and Romance '' category , it is obvious that something more would ultimately be sought from such contacts from one or both of the peoplpe involved . I would challenge the older person regarding his or her mental state , morals and ethics , primary relationships , and boundary issues , as well as remind him or her that any intimate action could verily easily be legally argued as statuatory rape . With all due respect to Diva4167 , I would also be concerned about the younger person 's primary relationships , as well as the fact that people of that age can be very fickle . Someone who can seem to be very special one day can seem horrible the next , because he or she is acting perfectly normally , but not within a set of ideals . 16 is the age to drive , 18 is the age of majority , and 21 is the legal drinking age . Those are the boundaries that this society has set , and there are consequences for blurring them . The difference between 24 and 28 is four years , but the difference between 14 and 18 is a lifetime . Live *your* life . Be well.Also , I would challenge why you felt it necessary to ask essentially the same question five times within a two-hour period . If you were an 18-year-old asking about a 22-year-old , I would be concerned about how he would react to your attention span . If you are serious about this , please just pose the question once , review the answers , and be done with it . Be well .",0
"What is the physics behind walking of insects on water surface ? Explain please. ? Surface tension , or the attraction of water molecules sideways and inwards at the surface of the water , cause water to act like an elastic trampoline . This lets the animal float without breaking the surface.To propel itself forward , the insect 's feet must push water backward ( for every action of the bug there is an equal and opposite reaction on the water ) . The rowing action of the legs produces miniature vortices ( whirlpools ) which move backward from the bug 's feet .",0

"What are the rules of the basketball game ? basketball , game played generally indoors by two opposing teams of five players each . Basketball was conceived in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith , a physical education instructor at the YMCA college in Springfield , Mass. , as a way to condition outdoor athletes during the winter months . His original list of 13 rules has undergone a century of revision , leading to faster pacing and greater athleticism . Today basketball is one of the most popular American sports and one the rest of the world has adopted.Basic RulesAt each end of the court—usually about 92 ft ( 28 m ) long and 50 ft ( 15 m ) wide—is a bottomless basket made of white cord net and suspended from a metal ring , 18 in . ( 46 cm ) in diameter , which is attached 10 ft ( 3.05 m ) above the floor ( usually hardwood ) to a backboard made of fiberglass , wood , or other material . Players may throw , dribble ( bounce ) , or shoot the basketball ( an inflated ball usually made of leather or rubber ) but may not run with it or kick it.Teams try to advance the ball and shoot it through one basket ( the ball must enter from above ) and to keep the opposition from scoring through the other . Each field goal , or basket , scores two points , or three points if shot from beyond a specified distance ( 21 ft/6 m in U.S. colleges , slightly longer in international and professional play ) . Teams must shoot the ball within a prescribed time limit ( 24 sec in the National Basketball Association ; 30 sec in international games and in most women 's play ; 45 sec in men 's collegiate play ) .Any player making illegal body contact with an opposing player is assessed a foul ; the opposing team may be given possession of the ball , or an opposing player awarded free throws at the basket from the foul line . Each made foul shot is worth one point . Players who exceed the foul limit ( usually five , but six in the NBA ) are disqualified from the game . International and collegiate basketball games have two 20-min halves , professionals play four 12-min quarters , and high schoolers play four 8-min quarters .",0

This also means anyone who does you harm should be served justice in the interest of protecting free principles.The problem is that everyone BUT Americans seem to eat up whatever the media says , or they lack the education to realize that Americans are like any other human being . We live for our happiness and productive achievement , and we highly value our liberty and security.Any actions we take are a result of that love for freedom and that moral pursuit . We do not tolerate socialism , facism , or totalitarianism , but rather open and mutually beneficial relationships and trade .",0

"What are the main aplications of `` Chaos Theory '' ? There have not been many direct applications of chaos theory so far , but the study of chaos and the emphasis on understanding chaos has given us new methods of research.One of the best examples I can think of is agent-based modelling in social sciences . For example , in theoretical combat , there is an old equation called Lanchester 's equation of combat , which predicts the casualty rate in a given time period for two different armies o fgiven sizes with given accuracies . Unfortunately , it tends not to be terribly accurate in numerical forescasts of battle outcomes . This is because the battle outcome depnds on the behavior of individual troops on the battlefield , and small changes in their behavior can cause big changes in battle outcome.The idea that small changes in an input cause big changes in an output is the essence of chaos theory . This has led to agent based modelling in which researchers assign behavioral attributes to individual troops rather than use a single variable to define a whole army . The computer calculates each troops interation with his own troops and with the enemy 's , and you get an outcome . Small changes in troop behavior will cause large changes in outcome . This can tell researchers what behaviors of soldiers may be most important to modify even slghtly.Observations of very different outcomes from small changes in starting conditions have led reserachers in all sorts of other fields to also attempt to understand this difference . Chemical engineers are often trying to understand tubulence and how small changes in pipe shapes can casue big changes in the way fluid flows .",0

"important events during george washingtons presidency ? Key Event : America Signs Treaty with Tripoli.Some more Key Events in President George Washington 's Administration• Precedents -- -Washington established two main precedents : a cabinet and the two-year term.• Whiskey Rebellion , 1794 -- -Washington ordered 15,000 troops to Pennsylvania and crushed the first challenge to federal authority.• Farewell Address , 1796 -- -Washington warned against the evils of political parties and `` tangling alliances '' abroad . On April 30 , 1789 , George Washington , standing on the balcony of Federal Hall on Wall Street in New York , took his oath of office as the first President of the United States . `` As the first of every thing , in our situation will serve to establish a Precedent , '' he wrote James Madison , `` it is devoutly wished on my part , that these precedents may be fixed on true principles . '' Born in 1732 into a Virginia planter family , he learned the morals , manners , and body of knowledge requisite for an 18th century Virginia gentleman . He pursued two intertwined interests : military arts and western expansion . At 16 he helped survey Shenandoah lands for Thomas , Lord Fairfax . Commissioned a lieutenant colonel in 1754 , he fought the first skirmishes of what grew into the French and Indian War . The next year , as an aide to Gen. Edward Braddock , he escaped injury although four bullets ripped his coat and two horses were shot from under him . From 1759 to the outbreak of the American Revolution , Washington managed his lands around Mount Vernon and served in the Virginia House of Burgesses . Married to a widow , Martha Dandridge Custis , he devoted himself to a busy and happy life . But like his fellow planters , Washington felt himself exploited by British merchants and hampered by British regulations . As the quarrel with the mother country grew acute , he moderately but firmly voiced his resistance to the restrictions . When the Second Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia in May 1775 , Washington , one of the Virginia delegates , was elected Commander in Chief of the Continental Army . On July 3 , 1775 , at Cambridge , Massachusetts , he took command of his ill-trained troops and embarked upon a war that was to last six grueling years . He realized early that the best strategy was to harass the British . He reported to Congress , `` we should on all Occasions avoid a general Action , or put anything to the Risque , unless compelled by a necessity , into which we ought never to be drawn . '' Ensuing battles saw him fall back slowly , then strike unexpectedly . Finally in 1781 with the aid of French allies -- he forced the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown . Washington longed to retire to his fields at Mount Vernon . But he soon realized that the Nation under its Articles of Confederation was not functioning well , so he became a prime mover in the steps leading to the Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia in 1787 . When the new Constitution was ratified , the Electoral College unanimously elected Washington President He did not infringe upon the policy making powers that he felt the Constitution gave Congress . But the determination of foreign policy became preponderantly a Presidential concern . When the French Revolution led to a major war between France and England , Washington refused to accept entirely the recommendations of either his Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson , who was pro-French , or his Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton , who was pro-British . Rather , he insisted upon a neutral course until the United States could grow stronger . To his disappointment , two parties were developing by the end of his first term . Wearied of politics , feeling old , he retired at the end of his second . In his Farewell Address , he urged his countrymen to forswear excessive party spirit and geographical distinctions . In foreign affairs , he warned against long-term alliances . Washington enjoyed less than three years of retir",0

"What is an alpha male ? An alpha male or alpha female is the individual in the community whom the others follow and defer to . Humans and their nearest species-relatives , the chimpanzees , show deference to the alpha of the community by ritualized gestures such as bowing , allowing the alpha to walk first in a procession , or standing aside when the alpha challenges . Canines also show deference to the alpha pair in their pack , by allowing them to be the first to eat and , usually , the only pair to mate . Wolves are a well known example of this.The status of alpha is generally achieved by means of superior physical prowess . However in certain highly-social species such as the Bonobo apes , the alpha can use more indirect methods ( such as political alliances ) to oust the ruling alpha and take his/her place .",0

You usually have to be paid for all the time you work . He could make you not work for 30 minutes , but if you actually work the 30 minutes , you need to be paid . If you tell us what your state , I could give a more detailed answer.Edit : It is definitely illegal . First , Nevada law says , `` An employer shall pay to the employee wages for each hour the employee works . '' Further , it is illegal to `` Pay a lower wage , salary or compensation to an employee than the amount earned by the employee when the work was performed . '' An employer can change the rate you are paid as a way to punish you , but that requires that they notify you in writing `` Not less than 7 days before the employee performs any work at the decreased wage , salary or compensation . '' Finally , the employer can withold amounts for certain reasons like health insurance and such , but for any other reason , the employee has to voluntarily authorize the deduction in writing . Tell your boss all of this and ask for your back wages in writing . If he refuses , talk to a lawyer.Edit2 : I forgot to add that the regulations specifically say `` An employer may not use a blanket authorization that was made in advance by the employee to withhold any amount from the wages due the employee . '' The employee has to sign the authorization each time .",0
"which is the oldest tree ? bristlecone pines have around 4,600 tree-rings and are still the world 's oldest living organisms . ( Bristlecone pines are native to the Rocky Mountains of the United States . ) BUT , maybe its not since.. On a wild Tasmanian mountain there is a magnificent , recently discovered stand of Huon pine trees that has been called the world 's 'oldest known living organism ' . It is hard to see how a tree could be older than the time since the biblical Flood , so if its published age of , more than 10,500 years old ' were correct , then this would present a serious challenge to Old Testament chronology . In fact , some media reports claim the tree 'could be 30,000 or 40,000 years old ' .",0

"How do I raise my credit score fast and without paying some company to erase stuff off my report ? Basic but effective tequniques or tricks if you know them . If someone asks you for money to increase your score , it is true that they are likely to be a thief , however , it is NOT TRUE that you can not raise your score . Your credit score is primarily affected by a few things . First , any time that you make a late payment , even one that is only 30 days late , that will effect your score as much as 50 points the first month . It will climb slowly each month thereafter if you pay on time . So , do n't ever pay late . Secondly , a large part of your score is determined by the ratio of credit used to credit available . If you have a $ 1,000 limit on your card , DO NOT leave a balance on that card of over $ 500 . The lower your credit debt to credit limits , the better your score will be . Lastly , the longer you have credit , the better . Some people will cancel cards and accounts that are infrequently used . Do n't do that ! Leave them open . On the other hand , having too many credit accounts means you are a credit hog . Every time you apply for credit , your score will go down , for a few months .",0

"define ergonomics elobrately ? Ergonomics ( or human factors ) is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system , and the profession that applies theory , principles , data and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance ( definition adopted by the International Ergonomics Association in 2000 ) .Ergonomists contribute to the design and evaluation of tasks , jobs , products , environments and systems in order to make them compatible with the needs , abilities and limitations of people ( IEA , 2000 ) .DomainsThe IEA divides ergonomics broadly into three domains : Physical ergonomics deals with the human body 's responses to physical and physiological loads . Relevant topics include manual materials handling , workstation layout , job demands , and risk factors such as repetition , vibration , force and awkward/static posture as they relate to musculoskeletal disorders ( see repetitive strain injury ) .Cognitive ergonomics , also known as engineering psychology , concerns mental processes such as perception , attention , cognition , motor control , and memory storage and retrieval as they affect interactions among humans and other elements of a system . Relevant topics include mental workload , vigilance , decision-making , skilled performance , human error , human-computer interaction , and training.Organizational ergonomics , or macroergonomics , is concerned with the optimization of sociotechnical systems , including their organizational structures , policies , and processes . Relevant topics include shift work , scheduling , job satisfaction , motivational theory , supervision , teamwork , telework and ethics.HistoryItalian Bernardino Ramazinni ( 1633-1714 ) became the first physician to write about work-related injuries and illnesses in his 1700 publication , `` De Morbis Artificum ( Diseases of Workers ) '' . Ramazinni was ostracized by his fellow doctors for visiting the workplaces of his patients in order to identify the causes of their disorders . The term ergonomics ( from the Greek words ergon [ work ] and nomoi [ natural laws ] ) first entered the modern lexicon when Wojciech Jastrzębowski used the word in his 1857 article Rys ergonomji czyli nauki o pracy , opartej na prawdach poczerpniętych z Nauki Przyrody ( adapted from a previous version of this page ) .Later in the 19th century , Frederick Taylor pioneered the `` Scientific Management '' method , an approach that sought the single best method to perform a job and its tasks . By incrementally reducing the size and weight of coal shovels until the optimum shoveling rate was reached , Taylor tripled the amount of coal that workers could shovel in a day . Frank and Lilian Gilbreth , in the early 1900s , expanded Taylor 's methods to develop `` Time and Motion Studies '' that aimed to improve efficiency by eliminating unnecessary steps and actions . By applying this approach , the Gilbreths reduced the number of motions in bricklaying from 18 to 4.5 , allowing bricklayers to increase their pace of laying bricks from 120 to 350 bricks per hour.World War II marked the advent of highly sophisticated machines and weaponry , creating previously unseen cognitive demands on operators in terms of decision-making , attention , situational awareness and hand-eye coordination . It was observed that perfectly working aircraft , flown by the best-trained pilots , still crashed . In 1943 , Alphonse Chapanis , a lieutenant in the U.S. Army , showed that `` pilot error '' could be greatly reduced when more logical and differentiable controls replaced confusing designs in airplane cockpits.In the decades following the war and leading to today , ergonomics has continued to flourish and diversify . The Space Age created new human factors issues such as weightlessness and extreme G-forces . To what extent could these environments be tolerated and what effects would they have on the mind and body ? The Information",0

"Is it legal to publicly rate medical doctors ? In the US and other countries.e.g . could I create a web site where I say that I rate Doctor X 70/100 and Doctor Y 75/100 , without any other explanation ? What if I do provide an explanation ? What if I rated mechanics instead of medical doctors ? NOT LEGAL ADVICE : As long as you make it clear that you are offering your opinion , then your ratings will be protected by the US Constitution 's 1st Amendment protection for free speech . ( You are in the US , right ? ) If you falsely or misleadingly indicate that your rankings are based on something other than your opinion , then there may be liability for libel or even fraud . However , if the rankings are based on some criteria other than your opinion , and you are explicit about the basis for the rankings and truthful about the results , you are similarly protected . Should n't be a difference for medical or mechanical rankings . But , keep in mind that if people rely on your endorsement and then something goes wrong , they may seek to hold you liable . The best protection against this is to be explicit about your sources ( opinion , etc . ) and have a lawyer advise you.Good luck !",0

"what does `` nobody can make you feel infrior without your permission '' mean ? what does `` nobody can make you feel inferior without your permission '' mean ? No one can MAKE you feel anything ( except physical pain of course ) . If you 're a professional dancer and some accountant who knows nothing about dance tells you you 're terrible , you 'll dismiss it because you do n't value his opinion . But if an accomplished dancer who you respect says the same thing it might make you actually question your talents , and feel inferior . In this case you would have given the dancer , but not the accountant , permission to make to make you feel inferior.But of course it might turn out that the dancer is old and bitter and wants to squash your potential by attacking your confidence . The key is to develop a solid sense of who you are - both your strengths and weaknesses . If someone attacks something you know is a strength , it should n't bother you . And if they attack something you know is a weakness - that really should n't bother you either because you 've accepted that this particular aspect is not your strongest .",0

"what etiquette , respect and rules does one need to follow as a tourist in Dubai , united Arab Emirates ? Hi - I 've only been to the airport in Duabi , but here are some pointers I found : DressAlthough the UAE is very liberal in many respects , the correct dress code is important in order not to cause offence . Conservative clothes that cover the body and limbs are preferable to casual shorts and sleeveless tops for both sexes , especially in rural areas where tradition is important.Indeed , long , loose clothing can be much cooler and more comfortable than smaller items that expose the skin to the hot sun.The Arab national dress worn in Dubai is made especially to keep the wearer cool during the hottest of weather . Men wear the kandoura or dishdasha , a white , ankle-length garment which is a loose fit and very effective in the hot and cold.Women wear an abayah , which is a black , long-sleeved , full-length robe . Both men and women wear head coverings to protect their heads and faces from the sun and windblown sand.Traditional garments are also ideal for when the temperature drops sharply at night.PhotographyNormal tourist photography is acceptable , but it is considered offensive to photograph Muslim women . It is also courteous to request permission before photographing men . Always avoid taking photographs of anything even remotely military , such as buildings , perimeter fences , vehicle convoys , checkpoints , airports and so on.TippingTipping practices are similar to most parts of the world . Where no service charge is included , 10 % is adequate.BargainingBargaining is an expected part of buying in the souk and elsewhere . Traders will usually drop their prices , often quite substantially , particularly for cash sales , but it is important to be polite at all times and not feign anger or disgust.RamadanDuring this month of fasting , pious Muslims will not eat anything during daylight hours , with most conforming to the injunctions . Foreigners are not expected to follow suit , but it is considered impolite to smoke , drink or eat in public during Ramadan . In general , I 've heard that it 's a fantastic place to go for so many reasons ! I 'm envious - have a great time .",0

"Buddhist Center in northern Jersey ? I 'm very interesting in practicing Buddhism with a mentor . So far , I 've been learning and practicing what I can from books and the internet , but would really like to hear lectures and recieve formal instruction . I am right across the river from NYC , and while there is a center on 5th ave. , I ca n't afford the fare to get there and back very often . Are there centers which offer free classes or lectures or guided meditation in northern jersey ? I would highly recommend a 10-day vipassana meditation course ( http : //www.dhamma.org/vipassan.htm ... ) if you can get the time off . I think it 's definitely worth it , so keep it in mind.It 's very intense , over 10 hours of meditation a day for 10 days , complete silence ( except with the teachers ) , and guidance instructions basically broken up into hour-chunks . It might seem intimidating but it 's very doable and you just need to have the intention to do it.Also it 's non-sectarian , anyone can practice it , and it 's free from any dogma , blind belief , etc.Also ( again ) the courses are free , by donation only , and no recommended or forced donation . Even the room and board are provided , because past students have found it to be beneficial so it 's supported entirely by donation.Very intense but since it 's so rigorous most people see distinct benefits after only 10 days .",0

She does not have a boyfriend-and before we started talking , she got the email i sent her mom and replied to just ask if she could email me .

"Can someone please explain me the blowfish algorithm ? Hi , I am using the blowfish algorithm for my project . I read the paper that Bruce wrote , but couldnt understand it fully ... .Can please some explain it to me ? ? Please ... dont paste the same thing that is on the website , tell me what you understand ! Thankyou ! ! ! IT is a Copy Paste But may be of some use ... .BlowFishBlowFish/TwoFish is a widespread security algorithm , which was published by Bruce Schneier in the beginning of the year 1994 . This algorithm works similar to DES and it uses block coding with blocks of a size of 64 bit . BlowFish was spread very fast after its publication , due to the fact that Bruce Schneier is one of the most famous cryptology experts and that this algorithm can be used without licence fee . In addition , using this algorithm data can be en- and decoded with high speed . If the routine for BlowFish is implemented in software , a disk space of less than five kilobytes is sufficient . You can vary the size of the key as as you like up to 448 bit . That is why this algorithm with its 2 448 different possibilities is protected against any Brute Force Attacks . This is how the encryption algorithm BlowFish works : BlowFish defines two different S boxes , a P box and four S boxes . The P box P is a one-dimensional field with 18 32-bit-values . The boxes contain accidental values , which are implemented in the code or generated during each initialization . The S boxes S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 contain 256 32-bit-values each . The BlowFish initialization looks like this : The key string is converted into 32-bit-values . The entire content of the P box is substituted by the values xor ’ t . The P box is now encrypted like the S box . BlowFish encryption ( block size : 64 Bit , rounds ( r ) : 16 ) : The data element is divided into two parts L and R , each of 32 bit . L is xor ’ t with P r. R is xor ’ t with f ( L ) . L and R are interchanged . This is done 16 times , until r =16 . R is xor ’ t with P 17 . L is xor ’ t with P 18 . Explanation of function f : The incoming 32-bit-value ( L in this case ) is divided into four 8-bit-vectors X1 , X2 , X3 , X4 . With the help of these vectors a 32-bit-value is selected from every S box . The result is linked by addition and xor . For decoding data , the entire process is performed the other way round .",0

"Who can tell me about Frances Farmer ? she 's was from seattle i think Frances Elena Farmer ( September 19 , 1913 , Seattle , Washington – August 1 , 1970 , Indianapolis , Indiana ) was an American film actress.Early life , career and marriageFarmer was born and raised in Seattle , Washington . In 1931 , at age 17 , she entered and won $ 100 in a writing contest sponsored by Scholastic Magazine with her controversial essay God Dies . In 1935 , as a student at the University of Washington , she won a subscription contest for the leftist newspaper The Voice of Action . First prize was a trip to the Soviet Union , which she took despite her mother 's strong objections . These two incidents led to accusations that Farmer was both an atheist and a Communist . Farmer studied drama at the University of Washington . During the 1930s its drama department productions were considered citywide cultural events and attended accordingly . While there she starred in diverse plays including Helen of Troy , Everyman and Uncle Vanya . In 1935 she starred in the school 's production of Alien Corn , speaking foreign languages , playing the piano and receiving rave reviews in what was the longest running play in the department 's history at the time.1936Returning from the Soviet Union in the summer of 1935 Farmer stopped in New York City , hoping to launch a legitimate theater career . Instead , she was referred to Paramount talent scout Oscar Serlin who arranged for a screen test . Paramount offered her a 7-year contract . Farmer signed it in New York on her 22nd birthday ( September 19 , 1935 ) and moved to Hollywood . She had top billing in two well-received 1936 `` B '' films and that same year was cast opposite Bing Crosby in Rhythm On The Range . Also in 1936 she was loaned to Samuel Goldwyn to appear in Come and Get It , based on the novel by Edna Ferber . Her portrayals of both the mother and daughter were praised by the public and critics , some of whom wrote of her potential to become a major star . She also married her first husband , actor Leif Erickson , in 1936.A rebellious starFarmer was not entirely satisfied with her career , however . She felt stifled by Paramount 's tendency to cast her in films which depended on her looks more than her talent and her naturally outspoken demeanor made her seem uncooperative and contemptuous . In an age when the studios dictated every facet of a star 's life , Farmer rebelled against the studio 's control and although she allowed herself to be put through cosmetic `` makeovers '' and photographed in bathing suits for publicity purposes , she resisted every attempt they made to glamourize her private life , refusing to attend Hollywood parties or to date other stars for the gossip columns . At the time , she was sympathetically described as being indifferent about the clothing she wore and was said to drive an older-model `` green roadster , '' which according to a columnist , once broke down on Melrose Avenue , blocking traffic as Farmer pushed the stricken car to the side , much to the consternation of the studio 's publicity department.Hoping to enhance her reputation as a serious actress , she left Hollywood in 1937 to do summer stock on the East Coast . She had already attracted the attention of Harold Clurman and Clifford Odets and appeared in the Group Theatre production of Odets ' play Golden Boy in a performance which at first received highly mixed reviews ( Time magazine commented that she had been miscast ) . However by 1938 when the production had embarked on a national tour , regional critics from Washington D.C. to Chicago had given her rave reviews.Farmer also had an affair with Odets but he was married to actress Luise Rainer and did n't offer Farmer a commitment . Farmer felt betrayed when Odets suddenly ended the relationship , believing he had used her drawing power to further the success of his play . She returned to Hollywood , somewhat chastened , willing to continue her movie career but still on her terms . She arranged with Paramount to s",0

"Why do Life Savers candy make blue sparks when you bite them ? It works the best with `` Wintogreen , '' rather than peppermint , and should be done with a fresh pack ( the moisture makes it spark better ) . The spark that comes from the Life Saver is considered as a type of triboluminescence , which the sugar in Life Savers contain . Here 's an excerpt from my source site : `` Wintergreen sparking , it 's believed , is actually a three-step process . Step One : When you shatter the sugar crystals with your teeth , electrons ( which are negatively charged ) break free . As a result , the atoms in which the electrons were formerly embedded become positively charged . In what amounts to a subatomic game of musical chairs , the free electrons dash around madly trying to find a new home . `` Step Two : Meanwhile , as the sugar crystals disintegrate , nitrogen molecules from the air attach themselves to the fractured surfaces . When the free electrons strike the nitrogen molecules , they cause the latter to emit invisible ultraviolet radiation , along with a faint visible glow . `` Step Three : The UV radiation is absorbed by the wintergreen flavoring , methyl salicylate . This then emits the fairly bright blue light you see . Pretty complicated , I admit . Clearly the planners in the Pentagon were n't the first to be obsessed with high-tech gimcracks . ''",0

"Do men and women see things differently ? The short answer is 'yes ' unless you are referring to sight.The right and left hemispheres of the human brain are connected by a huge nerve bundle called the corpus callosum . In the male fetus when male hormones are generated the corpus callosum shrinks reducing cross-communication . Because the left hemisphere deals with logic and the right hemisphere deals with emotion , women connect all logic better with emotion than men do . Although a man can chose , he is always either logical or emotional but rarely both at the same time . A man either flies off the handle or thinks the problem through . A woman can weep or laugh when she discovers something that makes sense . This explains why women are better at nurturing ( cranky ) children and men are better at hunting for bears ( or a six pack ) . Of course men can care for their children and women can hunt bare ; I mean bear .",0

Statements like:1. evolution depends on carbon dating2 . the big bang is part of evolution3 . if you accept the big bang you are an atheist/offensive to God/damned/etc4 . if you accept evolution you are an atheist/doing the work of the devil/damned/etc5 . illogical , intellectually dishonest definitions of the word `` theory '' in the context of `` scientific theory '' 6. irrational , intellectually dishonest definitions of what is `` scientific '' or what `` religion '' is.Frankly , making statements like this , and wandering into the scientific realm speaking nonsense really reflects badly on the religious community . It would be as if prominent scientists went and started to dictate to religious groups about what they could and could not do , or how they could worship . I feel that ignorance of any sort reflects badly on anyone . I think the problem many religious people have is that they feel science and religion are mutually exclusive , and that the sole purpose of science is to debunk religion . I 'm of another school of thought , that science and faith can coexist quite nicely . I 'm in good company , too : Johann Kepler , one of the greatest astronomers who ever lived : `` “ I thank Thee , my Creator and Lord , that Thou hast given me this joy in Thy creation , this delight in the works of Thy hands ; I have shown the excellency of Thy works unto man , so far as my mind was able to comprehend Thine infinity ” '' Blaise Pascal , mathematician and philosopher , discoverer of what is now called Pascal 's Law : `` ..the only perfect knowledge [ comes ] through Christian revelation '' Sir Isaac Newton : `` This most beautiful system of the sun , planets , and comets , could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being '' Louis Pasteur : `` ..spontaneous generation ( like materialism in general ) threaten [ s ] the very concept of God the Creator '' Wernher von Braun , one of the world ’ s foremost rocket engineers : `` It is as difficult for me to understand a scientist who does not acknowledge the presence of a superior rationality behind the existence of the universe as it is to comprehend a theologian who would deny the advance of science . Far from being independent or opposing forces , science and religion are sisters ... .There is certainly no scientific reason why God can not retain the same position in our modern world that He held before we began probing His creation with the telescope and cyclotron ” 'nuff said . : - )",0

"Dose the moon orbit the sun ? If we just look at the sun , earth , moon system , all three bodies orbit the center of mass of this 3-body system . Since the sun is much more massive than the other two bodies , the location of the center of mass of this system is inside the sun , so the sun moves very little , while the earth and moon appear to orbit the sun.Now , the earth and the moon also interact gravitationally , and they orbit the center of mass of the earth moon system The center of mass of this earth-moon system is located inside the earth , so the moon looks like it orbits the earth . You can view the earth and moon as being in orbit around their center of mass , and the earth-moon system center of mass being in orbit around the earth-sun-moon system.If the sun , earth , moon had equivalent masses , and if there were no other gravity bodies in the universe , they would appear to have orbits around the center of mass of this smaller earth , moon , sun system.I think the term '' orbit '' can be a little confusing because it 's not always clearly defined . The gravitational attraction of the sun on the moon is greater than the earth 's attraction on the moon , so you could also argue that the moon really orbits the sun , with it 's orbit modified by the earth .",0
"How deep can a scuba diver descend before encountering a dangerous level of pressure ? Is there a way this is calculated ? If so , how ? The main dangers a suba diver are subjected to dealing with depth are not just because of pressure , but because of the pressure of Nitrogen or Oxygen in the lungs.Too much nitrogen forced into the blood causes nitrogen narcosis , which is like being drugged by a narcotic . How deep you go depends on how the percentage of nitrogen in your air and how long you are down.Too mush Oxygen forced into the blood is toxic , and can directly cause brain damage or death . Again , how deep you go depends on the percentage of oxygen in the tank and how long you are going to be down.http : //www.scubadiving.com/training/specialty_and_advanced/what % 27s_in_your_tank % 3f/Finally , the more air that gets dissolved in you blood , the more at risk you are of having the air boil out of your blood as you come back to the surface ( this is called the bends ) and is also very dangerous . SCUBA diver have tables or dive computers that let them know , based on how deep they have been and for how long , whether they are at risk of getting the bends and if so , how slowly they need to come up in order to let the gases gradually go back out of the blood and into the lungs.With helium and ( small amount of ) oxygen in a tank , Mark Ellyatt dived to 313 m ( 1025 feet ) . http : //www.inspired-training.com/depth_record.htmThe depth limit for a Los Angeles class nuclear submarine is only 950 feet.http : //www.navsource.org/archives/08/08688.htm",0

"Why ca n't a praying mantis be enlarged 80 times its size and survive ? A giant mantis has two reasons not to survive.To sum the consequenses up , a giant prayer mantis has difficulty taking in oxygen ; can not fly ; and will collapse.The first , the oxygen thing . Just as the previous answer indicates , insects intake oxygen via diffusion.Picture a room with perfect still air , like a cellar . Suppose you put an open bottle of perfume at one end of the room . Some time later , you can smell the perfume at the other end of the room . There 's no air current in the room to bring the fragrant to you . It 's the perfume molecules , they wander around randomly . Some of them find their way into your nostrils so you can smell them . You will be able to smell the perfume sooner in a smaller room because the molecules have to wander through a shorter distance.The blood of insects does not carry oxygen , they have a series of air-filled tubes ( called trachea , plural tracheae ) all over their body , opening to some 'port-holes ' ( called spiracles ) along their abdomen . Most of insects are so small that the oxygen molecules , once entered the spiracles ( port-holes ) , do n't have long to wander along the tubes before reaching their destination -- the organs where they are consumed . Now , suppose the same insect is enlarged 80 times its length . The airway is also enlonged 80 times . It would take a LOT more time for oxygen to wander along this super long tube . During that time , the organs would have consumed all the oxygen around them without new oxygen coming in . So they die , and the insect dying with them.However this is only the case for small insects . Larger insects actually have air-bags withing their body to make a breeze along their tracheae ( air tubes ) to bring in oxygen . Quoting from the sourse page , `` Larger insects , such as grasshoppers and wasps , have internal air sacs connected to their tracheae . These insects speed up their gas exchange by squeezing the sacs to make them suck air in from outside . '' I 've no idea whether a prayer mantis has air sacs or not , but I 've seen one bigger than any grasshoppers or wasps I ever saw . Nevertheless , a giant prayer mantis would need much more powerful air sacs than the grasshoppers'.Now come to the second reason . Size . We will look at the two consequences of a super-huge size seperately.Think of a car on a highway . It can drive over 100 feet in a matter of seconds -- let 's say 2 seconds , so it 's speed is 50 feet per second . Now the car shrinks to the size of a prayer mantis . In the same 2 seconds , how far can it drive now ? 1 feet , more or less , so it 's speed is 0.5 feet per second . We see that the mini car is much slower . But the driver , who shrank with the car , he thinks he 's driving as fast ! Now think of the mantis , and think of a helicopter . The mantis flies much slower than the helicopter , just like the mini car is slower than the real car . And we have it that the faster things move through the air , the more resistance they experience . The helicopter flies fast , so its shape must be streamlined , as to reduce air resistance . The prayer mantis flies slow , so he does n't care much about air resistance , he can have any cool shape he desires . But for a giant mantis ? He would move much faster , and experience so much air resistance that with his cool shape ( not much streamlined ) he wo n't be able to fly at all.Let 's face the second consequence . Has anyone ever made a jelly block 5 feet long , 5 feet wide and 5 feet high ? What will happen if such a giant jelly is constructed ? It would collapse right away and flow like water . But any half-inch long , half-inch wide , half-inch high jelly block would stay all right in one 's spoon . What happens when the jelly grows in size ? For each bit of jelly in the bottom , there 's simply much more jelly on top of it ! And when that bit of jelly can no longer bear the burden , it breaks itself and flow away so that it wo n't have to support any more . So th",0

"What ever happened to Romance ? When I romance a woman she does n't even know wht it is . Do you know what it is ? This is open to men and women I agree with you . First , lets start with your idea of romance . Is it walks on the beach ? Bike rides across the Golden Gate ? Or , Friday/Saturday nites clubbing and getting hammered ? My point is , women have as many definitions of romance as they do shoes . That 's why some girls do n't recognize your brand of romance . It 's like a cold sales call , you need to read that girl and adjust your game accordingly . There is n't a wrong or right way to romance .",0

"WHat are some good stanima exercizes or maybe lungs ? And where is a good place to learn football plays ? I have always been good at football naturally but never got into it .

I need to also learn a way to heal my leg quick and well for practice cause i fucced it up real bad at school play running back today . The kids want me to win them a tropy next year so im gon na do it . There are only a handfull of base plays that beginners need to know : Belly , Option , Sweep and Iso . Each play has its variations . There are at least thirty base option plays that have their own variations.The important thing is to know the basic idea of each . Play Madden , watch the games on TV , play with your buddies . More important than knowing the plays are your fundamental skills . Running the ball is a fraction of what backs need to do for their team to be successful . You will need to block , catch and run to contribute to your team . Check out the site below for drills , plays and info . You can even check out a play from each NFL team 's actual playbook.If you would be more specific about your injury I could help you more . Remember R-I-C-E : Rest it/Ice it/Compress it ( w/tape or a wrap ) /Elevate it . Every great running back needs a motto . For example : As Walter Peyton used to say , `` Make a defensive player pay for tackling you . '' ( LOL )",0
"Why , for the majority , is academia so liberal when it comes to politics ? Academia is so liberal because they learn so much about everything that the feel they must accept it all . So they begin to think of everything as relative , including right and wrong . Eventually they think they are so much smarter than everyone because they are so 'open-minded ' that they lose their souls in their quest to be 'open-minded ' . Not only will they support a religious Jihad that kills innocent people but they will blame it on the innocent people that are killed because we 'just do n't understand ' our attackers . So , in summary , academia is so liberal because they want to be relativists about everything . They forget that to have shades of gray , there needs to be black and white .",0

"will the usa ever win the soccer world cup ? I believe the USA can win the World Cup this year . Noone is writing us off this time around . We are ranked in the top 10 by FIFA . To go along with our ranking , we have some of the best goalkeeping in the world ( Keller , Howard , and a number of MLS keepers like Reis and Hartman ) . We have a solid defense with Bocanegra , Onyewu , Hejduk , and Pope ( and maybe even Pablo Mastroeni ) . World-class midfielders in Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley will be stepping onto the pitch ( not to mention the solid job players like Kerry Zavagnin put forth each and every time they take the field ) . Up top , we have the emergence of Taylor Twellman in the international game and the return of Eddie Johnson to the fold . We have a coach in Bruce Arena who , I believe , if he leaves after the tournament , should get a top-flight European league job next fall ( Malcolm Glazer hiring Bruce Arena at ManU if Sir Alex Ferguson were to leave ? A long shot maybe , but intriguing. ) . Add to that , one of Italy 's best players , Francesco Totti , recently went down with a serious injury and will be out until at least May . Even if he does come back for the tournament , will he be at full strength ? Ghana 's midfielder Laryea Kingston will also miss the tournament through suspension . While we have a tough road to travel both in our group and with the possibility of Brazil lurking in the round of 16 , I believe the USA has the ability to take on the world 's best and win it all .",0

"why is the Pacific Ocean so cold all the time ? the atlantic ocean is so warm , and the other ocean , the PACIFIC , is so cold . why ? In the southern half of the ocean the Humboldt Current flows north along the coast of South America . The cold mineral rich waters support many millions of small fish , which are eaten by larger fish and seabirds.At regular intervals a huge area of the Pacific becomes warmer . Because warm water rises above cold , the sea-level increases . This change in temperature and level causes an alteration in the pattern of the winds . The warm water travels across the Pacific at 100 kms a day . This phenomenon , known as El Nino , deflects the Humboldt Current . 1997 saw the highest temperature recorded of this warm water during the last 150 years .",0

what is a double layer DVD burner ? Movie DVDs you buy in the store can contain up to 8.5 gigabytes of data . This is because they are pressed ( as opposed to burned ) dual-layer DVDs ( also called DVD-9 ) . The recordable DVD+-Rs that have been on the market for a while a single-layer DVD-5s and can store up to 4.7 gigabytes . This disrepency is why programs that copy movie DVDs need to compress the DVD content after unencrypting it before they can be burned to a normal DVD . Recently new DVD burners and media were introduced that allowed people to burn DVD-9 DVDs reasonably affordably.So a double-layer DVD burner is one that is capable of burning 8.5 gigabyte DVD-9 format DVDs.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd # Technical_information,0

"Can infinite be a finite measurement ? There are many concepts of infinity , some poetic , some mathematic . In math its a pretty definite concept , poetically its just mind-boggling large . `` If you remove a part from infinity or add a part to infinity , still what remains is infinity '' . So what happens if you have one infinity , and remove bits of it to create another infinitity separated by a small space ? You 'd probably end up with two infinities , which means the concept has to be finite.So as an amount , its indefinite , but as a concept , especially as a singularity in math , has a definite meaning ( measurement was too confusing ) .For example , in trigonometry tan 90° = ∞ , and arctan ∞ = +/- 90° . So while the actual value of ∞ is unknown , the value itself has meaning .",0

"Are there any Biblical verses that refute Mormon teachings ? Please explain. ? Way too many . Here is a good link to do some research.http : //www.carm.org/mormon.htmMormons not only claim to be Christians , but to be the only true Christians . According to them , the early Christian church went through an apostacy , lost the true teaching of God , and is built on a Bible that , according to them , is translated incorrectly and is missing many books.Interestingly , while LDS Church president Gordon Hinckley assures the press that `` the New Testament is a fundamental scripture for us , '' ( Note 1 ) he fails to point out the Mormons ' bias against the Bible.Article 8 of the Mormon Articles of Faith ( Note 2 ) says , `` We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it has been translated correctly . '' This approach allows Mormons to ignore key Bible Scriptures which refute Mormon doctrines . Bible verses used to counter Mormon teachings are brushed off in favor of passages from the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scriptures ( as well as ongoing revelation that often contradicts previous LDS Church teachings ) .It should be noted that the LDS Church has published its own version of the King James Bible , incorporating footnotes explaining what corrections from Joseph Smith 's `` inspired version '' of the Bible ( a version full of errors and plagiarized material ) should be taken into account.However , in spite of their efforts at revisionism , Mormons have not been able to support their claims . On the contrary . While Mormon allegations regarding the Bible and the course of Christianity are refuted by history , archeology , and other sciences , the scriptures of the Mormon church are problematic at every turn . Far from showing us so-called 'restored truth , ' they are testimonies to the deceptive nature of Mormonism .",0

"How to deal with my 10 yrs old daughter that is always late and seems she does n't understand that time goes by Some people do not have good concepts of time regardless of what others tell them . It might be in part due to ADD or some other cognitive issue or that they might become so present in each moment that they are unable to think about anything else mundane and necessary such as time and that they have to conform to it 's limits . ADD can have bizarre opposites like not being aware of or focused enough to notice something like time , but then being so focused on what you 're doing that you are unaware of time ... Contrary but it occurs . But please do n't rush to drugs if you find they have ADD . Drugs are n't always the answer and can have horrible side effects , ritalin is just pharmaceutical speed . Awareness and education and remaining involved in an activity they love is the best bet for ADD-like issues.Talk to her nicely about it . Explain that unfortunately in this modern world , one we do n't have much of a choice about living in unless we want to live in the woods , have to conform to a little to be able to get along and function well in . Help her understand what the consequences of time management are about and the downfalls of it to herself and to others . Nicely of course . No pressure but engage her conscience so that she feels responsible for the affect she has upon another person when she is late . You can also enlist tools such as a large clock that she can understand with hands/dials or digital numbers . Help her practice what time she begins something , how long she will be at it and then when she will stop that activity to begin another ... etc . Or a timer that she can set for a distinct amount of time so that when it goes off she knows she has something she has to get ready for next and allows her time to plan . Ask her what her beliefs are about time and her responsibility to others is in regards to being on time . Ask her what 's going on , engage her opinion even if she has to figure it out as you go . It will help her become conscious of the situation beyond your frustration and into her role in it.Look into different methods in the educational department or section for kids with learning disabilities ( even if she does n't have one ) . The resources are good and you can use them to your advantage , like I said even if she does n't have one . Good luck !",0

"Best way to get into Voice Over work ? Where in the name of heaven do I find job postings for voice over work ? It seems to be a very insular community . Is the only `` in '' through taking high-priced classes ? Maybe I do n't know the best way , but my father is a Voice Actor , and is very successful . He offers great work shops in the L.A. area and often takes serious aspiring voice actors under his wing . I 've noticed that in his field there are some tricks . 1 . Of course you have to have a good agent . He works with a well known agency . 2 . You have to understand the trends of the business . When I was younger , he worked on a lot of cartoons like Duck Tales , Gummi Bears , Bearnstien Bears , Snorks , and a bunch of other ones . But these days , the younger voices seem to be a trend . He has had to tailor his work in a new way to get into the right realm of voice acting again . Good thing he has a great agent . 3 . This is the most important in my opinion . You have to be honest and HARD WORKING . I noticed that a lot of people in entertainment are ego-centric . They wo n't take a job unless it has a great image attached to it . When my father got his job , he took any and every job he could get . The side product was that he became extremely good at it . He has more practice than anybody , and he now bears the nick-name `` one-take Brian '' to most of his collegues in Hollywood . So when a commercial is done and they need to lay the VO tracks on the video ... he 's the man they call in crunch time because they know he 'll get it done fast . He saves sound engineers money on reduced studio time too . So I guess hard work and integrity pay off in a business where there 's a lot of less honest and less hard working people . It 's a great business and he loves it . It 's very lucrative for him too . However , I 've seen a lot of people fail at it . Get out there.. make demos , get your name known , practice your trade , and take what you can get . I hope it works out . If you live in the L.A. area and are interested in a good contact or his workshops , contact me . He has a good repetoire of well known roles and he knows most of the famous Voice Actors out there from Jim Cummings to Gary Owens .",0

"box and whisker plots ? how do you pick out the numbers to use with a box and whisker plot when you have all the quartiles , and smallest and largest numbers ? A box-and-whisker plot can be useful for handling many data values . They allow people to explore data and to draw informal conclusions when two or more variables are present . It shows only certain statistics rather than all the data . Five-number summary is another name for the visual representations of the box-and-whisker plot . The five-number summary consists of the median , the quartiles , and the smallest and greatest values in the distribution . Immediate visuals of a box-and-whisker plot are the center , the spread , and the overall range of distribution . The first step in constructing a box-and-whisker plot is to first find the median , thelower quartile and the upper quartile of a given set of data . Example : The following set of numbers are the amount of marbles fifteen different boys own ( they are arranged from least to greatest ) .18 27 34 52 54 59 61 68 78 82 85 87 91 93 100 First find the median . The median is the value exactly in the middle of an ordered set of numbers . *68 is the medianNext , we consider only the values to the left of the median : 18 27 34 52 54 59 61 . We now find the median of this set of numbers . Remember , the median is the value exactly in the middle oa an ordered set of numbers . Thus 52 is the median of the scores less than the median of all scores , and therefore is the lower quartile.52 is the lower quartileNow consider only the values to the right of the median : 78 82 85 87 91 93 100 . We now find the median of this set of numbers . The median 87 is therefore called the upper quartile . 87 is the upper quartile ( *If you 're finding the median in an ordered set with an even number of values , you must take the average of the two middle numbers . For example : 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 . Add the two middle numbers . 5 + 7 = 12 . Divided 12 by 2 to get the average . 12 / 2 = 6 . Therefore 6 is the median for the ordered set of 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 . ) You are now ready to find the interquartile range ( IQR ) . The interquartile range is the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile . In our case the IQR = 87 - 52 = 35 . The IQR is a very useful measurement . It is useful because it is less influenced by extreme values , it limits the range to the middle 50 % of the values.35 is the interquartile rangeplease review these pages .",0

"Why Were The Days of the Week Named After The Solar System ? I was just curious . I know that Sunday is named after the Sun . Monday=Moon , Tuesday=Mars , Wed.=Mercury , Thur.=Jupiter , Friday=Venus , & Sat.=Saturn ... But why exactly ? . Was it believed that those days revolved around each of those planets at that time ? or what ? Thanks . A long time ago in human history , people thought that Earth was flat , and at the universe 's center . They believed that seven members of the solar system forever circled around us—see graphic to the right , or view one from Censorinus - Sur le jour natal . Some Mediterranian peoples also believed that each hour of the day was ruled by either the Sun , Moon or one of five then-known planets , all of which were thought of as gods . The sequence in which they thought hours were governed was the inverse order of distance they believed those solar system objects to be from Earth . During this time , Egyptians thought that the most distant was Saturn , shown at the bottom of the graphic above . They thought that the order of closer members ( shown counterclockwise following Saturn ) was Jupiter , Mars , Sun , Venus , Mercury and closest , the Moon . So they believed that the first hour was ruled by Saturn , the second by Jupiter and so on . Egyptians also believed that after each seven hours the order in which these objects ruled was repeated , so it started again with Saturn . According to those ancient Egyptians , the planet that ruled the first hour also governed the entire twenty-four hour period , and gave its name to that day . The first ( and also the 8th , 15th and 22nd ) hours of the first day were sacred to Saturn , the 23rd to Jupiter , the 24th to Mars and the first hour of the next day to the Sun . Therefore , they believed that the first day was ruled by and named after Saturn ( Saturday ) and the second was ruled by ( and named after ) the Sun ( Sunday ) . Egyptians once divided all twelve 30-day months ( of their 360-day calendar year ) into three 10-day weeks in the same manner as Greeks of the same period . The epoch at which planet worship caused them to change its length to seven days is not known , but it must have been over twenty-five hundred years ago because Herodotus , writing in his History during the 5th century B.C . said : `` Here are some other discoveries of the Egyptians . They find ... each day belongs to a god ... '' Adherents of the cult of Sin at Harran , who were known as Harranians or Sabeans by Arabic and Syrian authors , named their days after the same solar system members as Egyptians and Persians . Like Hebrews and many other peoples , they considered the one named after Saturn to be the seventh day , so they began their week with a day named after the Sun . All seven days were named after solar system members in the same order as they were in Egypt . It is interesting to note that these exact same solar system objects , and in the same sequence , were also used to name days in ancient India , Tibet and Burma . This is also true of names for Japanese days of the week , but the custom there has been traced back only a thousand years . Roman soldiers stationed in Egypt became accustomed to the pagan seven-day week and began to introduce it into their own homeland to replace their eight-day marketing week . Octavian ( Caesar Augustus ) and succeeding Roman rulers permitted this practice but it was n't made official until the emperor Constantine took that step in A.D. 321 . English names for days of the week are derived from Anglo-Saxon names for those same seven heavenly bodies that were revered by ancient peoples . Compare those English and Anglo-Saxon day names in the table below . Other similarities between day and `` planet '' names in various countries can be observed there .",0

"why do hen lay eggs ? Chicken eggs are the most commonly eaten egg . They are highly nutritious . Eggs are high in complete protein and provide significant amounts of several vitamins and minerals ( Vitamin A , Riboflavin , Folic Acid , Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12 , and Iron ) . Eggs are among the cheapest single-food source of complete protein available , which is essential to health and well being.The shape of an egg is approximately an oblate ellipsoid , but , while keeping cylindrical symmetry , there is typically not quite symmetry in a plane perpendicular to the long axis . See also oval ( geometry ) .Shell colorDifferent breeds of chicken can lay eggs with shells varying from whites through to brown and rarer colours such as speckled green . Although there are absolutely no nutritional differences , there is often a cultural preference for one colour over another . For example , in most regions of the United States eggs are generally white , while in the northeast of that country , and in the United Kingdom eggs are generally light-brown . These habits may be associated with perceptions of greater purity in white-shelled eggs or greater wholesomeness in brown-shelled eggs",0

"How do you help a people who lost 6 million souls ? My great grandfather was captured brought to Auswitz Natzi death camp and tortured for a long time untill one day he escaped succesfull but while losing his friends who were shot and killed by the Nazis in an attempt to escape . Out of 26 only 4 lived . 6 Million of my anscestors perrsihed in what is called the Holocost . Oh ! `` Tears '' This is so hard to write ! Can you imagine being 10 years old in one of those cattle cars not knowing where these nazis were taking you and then seeing the smoke from the creamatroiums . You ask , where is my father or mother and someone points to the smoke and sais , there , they are going to heaven . `` Weeps ! `` .We must never forget the holocost folks ! But I wonder if any of you have an idea of how this Jew from a surviving family of the holocost could honar and help other such families ? I just do n't know how to express my heart and its breaking when i considder 6 million of my own people dead at the hand of Hitler . Paperclips is a very powerful documentary and I agree , EVERYONE should watch it . It should be a requirement in school . As should be Schindlers List . All through my childhood I heard my fraternal grandparents talk about Hitler and the Nazis . They came to the state not long after he came into power and started persecuting the jews . While not jewish themselves they had many close friends that were and could n't stand to watch them suffer . Knowing this was only the beginning they left Germany and came to the US . If Hitlers name was mentioned around my Grandma tears welled up in her eyes and she called hi the worst evil that had ever happened to mankind . But by far the most powerful and moving thing I have ever felt was when I was 16 . I was visiting relatives in Europe with my Aunt . Knowing what I was studying in school that semester we took a side trip and she took me to Auschwitz so that i could truely understand what I was being taught , though we were n't Jewish she wanted me to understand . As long as I live i will remember that , seeing the ovens and hearing what happened there . It was almost as if that place screamed in pain still for the evil that was committed there . No member of our tour group was left dry eyed by the time it was over . The most vivid memory of it was seeing the ovens then hearing the older lady next to us break down in tears . Turns out she was dying of cancer and before she departed this earth she had to see where he parents and brothers had perished.To so many of us evil of this enormity is hard to grasp and fathom but every day of our lives we see or hear a small part of it . Every time you utter a racial slur , make a biggoted remark , show intolerance to anothers religion or belief system you are perpetuating Hitlers legacy . Because that is what it was , hatered and biggotry and intolerance . It took 6 million people dying for the rest of the world to understand that lesson , of what that mindframe and and those views can bring about . And the worst thing we can do is forget it or glorify the kinds of acts or thinking that brought on all of those deaths . Because it was n't hitler alone that killed them all , it was people who felt the way he did and thought nothing of it . Look around you and i bet you have met people like that . Or maybe you are yourself , so none of this has gone away and all the lessons have not sunk in . Six million people , our minds truely ca n't wrap around that number . All because of intolerance and biggotry . As you read through the answers to some of the questions on these pages you can see it here as well . Intolerance to other peoples view or religions , a supreme and superior attitude because 'I am right my religion is right the rest of you are wrong ' . That attitude is what helped take 6 million people from this earth . That is what ALLOWED the nazis to do what they did . They saw those in those camps as wrong and not as good as themselves , that they were superior . Those camps still exhist today as a reminder of that evil . And believe me if you walk through the gates you can feel it , you can feel the pain and anguish that went on there . It screams at you from every inch of it . 6 MILLION people killed because someone else was sure they were right and they were superior . Those shows on the History Channel SHOULD upset you ! They should upset you every time you see them and never should you become callous to them or what they show . That is about the only reminder this world has left of what can come from biggotry and hatered.Next time , before you write out from your superior point of view and point out how everyone else is wrong , or laugh at an ethnic joke or make fun of someone because they are different think about Hitler and what that kind of mindset can cause ... SIX MILLION SOULS TAKEN FROM THIS EARTH BECAUSE THE NAZIS THOUGHT THEY WERE BETTER AND KNEW THEY WERE RIGHT !",0

"Why do people not help others as a matter of course ? If I meet someone , and they need help of some kind , I do everything in my power to help them . Others will say 'I 'm too busy , ' or 'That 's their problem ' . What has happened to the world ? It has sadly become far too focused on itself . If you need more proof , just take a look around at the number of people engaged in a cell phone conversation in public.It seems to me our entire culture has turned in on itself , making it ever more convenient to separate ourselves from the world . Technology has become a double-edged sword , providing us with amazing new ways to be more productive and organized , but often at the expense of human interaction . Communicaton and entertainment devices provide us with amazing mobility , but our Blackberrys and iPods only further cut us off from one another.Of course , technology is n't the whole problem . Our culture has also become incredibly jaded and disenfranchised , always expecting the worst from others and usually getting it . We use childish , egotistical athletes as role models , making life all about `` getting paid '' . Our fascination with celebrity has become an obsession -- just check out the ratings for `` reality '' shows . And our domestic and international political views are too often shaped by sound bites and media talking heads . Apparently it 's just easier to agree with someone than figure it out yourself.I do n't believe it has to be like this . Our technological advancements do n't have to come with a price that devalues our very existence . And we do not just have to accept that the world with all its troubles is simply beyond redemption . We simply have to want to be involved in the lives of others . How do we do that ? Parents have to care more about their kids ' relationships with others ( not to mention their own ) than they do about making sure they 're doing the right things . We have to educate on how to use technology to collaborate , instead of to isolate . We have to look harder for our heroes . Let 's face it -- the one thing 9/11 taught Americans was who they really were . In short , we all have to love ourselves and life and be obsessed about them less .",0

Others , specially politicians , say it was stolen by the US . That all really depends on your definition of `` stole . '' Technically , the Mexican government signed the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo , ceding all of the territories to which you refer in exchange for $ 15 million and ending the Mexican-American War . One could say , however , that the Mexican-American War was merely a pretext for taking all of the territory , and it is likely not far from the truth . Also , a large chunk of Arizona and a section of New Mexico were purchased after the stealing of the rest in 1853 as the Gadsden Purchase , in which the US paid Mexico $ 10 million , about $ 343,826,098 accounting for inflation .",0
"How can I start a prison ministry in my church and have it remain safe for children ? Your church should already have guidelines of who should be allowed to be near the children .

Are angels real ? Definitly . God Created them before man and they are our servants . They are to be helpers to us on earth . It is pretty amazing that God would hold us in higher position ( or so it seems ) but Jesus said that if anyone wants to be first in the Kingdom - he must be a servant to all . So In that sense the Angels are above us - because they serve God and all us humans . Anyway - They most definitly are real . God says so . : ),0

"why did terry bradshaw not appear with the mvp 's in the super bowl ? When the NFL unveiled its MVPs from the previous 39 Super Bowls , only three living members skipped the ceremony.Former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana and former Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw decided to stay home , while former Dolphins MVP Jake Scott was traveling in Australia.Montana , the league 's only three-time Super Bowl MVP , and Bradshaw reportedly turned down the invitation over money.Both denied the reports.In a phone interview with ESPN2 's Cold Pizza on Monday night , Montana vehemently denied forgoing the ceremony over money and reiterated that his absence was due to his preference to see his son 's basketball game.He 'd told Cold Pizza last week he was n't going to be at the game because his son had an important basketball game he wanted to attend . Bradshaw , according to the Chronicle , told league officials he wanted to be with his family.Montana said money was never an issue and that he would not have attended the Super Bowl ceremony even if the appearance fee had been greater than the $ 100,000 he was reported to have requested.Former MVPs were given $ 1,000 for incidental expenses while in Detroit , along with other amenities such as plane tickets , car rental and game tickets.Sources told each paper that Montana asked for a guarantee of at least $ 100,000 in appearance money.When the league balked at Montana 's demands , the quarterback declined to be in attendance .",0

"why should aperson lose their job for forgeetting to turn in money that they are told to keep in their pockets My daughter was a very dedicated employee at Dayton International airport , went to work on her off days just to help out , did whatever her job duties call for her to do , a very repectful young lady that spent six year in the US Army . Nine months in Iraq . She was fired from the airport because they are told to keep money that they collect from customer in their pocket until the end of the day , instead of having a cash box for them to put the money in as soon as they collect it . She forgot she had the money in her pocket three times and took the money home ; therefore they fired her . Although she took the money back each time . She had been working there for one year and that is all they could find to fire her for . She really need her job she have a 4 year old daughter that she is raising . She have bills each month . it 's a shame when young people choose to get out and work and not be on public assistant to get fired for something like that . it 's hard to find jobs . I think it 's sad that your daughter lost her job at the aiport , she sounded like a very dedicated employee willing to go the extra mile even on her days off . But it is probably best she is no longer there because what you are describing here is that she was probably long past exhaustion each time she accidentally took the money home , although I am certain the airport did n't consider this when they decided to fire her.On the WHY part of your question : When she first was employeed by the airport she probably signed an agreement of `` if I mishandle money in any way that is n't in agreement with the airports rules , I understand that is grounds for dismissal '' If she agreed to these terms and broke them , is was their call to be understanding or not . They were 2 times before , but when they see a pattern of it , they are less likely to trust their money is safe . They will protect themsevles before protecting her.I agree they should n't make it so easy to leave your shift without turning the money in first . Just like with waiters and waitresses , or bartenders that most of the time must carry change on them , if the airport had an end shift report to do before each employee was allowed to leave , then it could all be resolved . I do n't know any waiters or waitresses that can leave for the day without giving the company their money first , along with reporting their tipped earnings for the day.Her honesty in giving the money back is something to be proud of , and she should n't hold bad memories against the airport for their descision . She made a mistake , we all do that once in a while . She 'll find another job , and she will have this experience to learn from .",0

"how is the president of the united nations elected ? I think you 're referring to the position of UN Secretary General . There is no position as `` President of the U.N. '' The United Nations Secretary-General is the head of the Secretariat , one of the principal divisions of the United Nations . The Secretary-General is appointed to a five year term . UN Secretaries-General usually serves two consecutive terms , but sometimes only one . The U.N. Secretary General is chosen in two steps : The Security Council nominates a candidate to the U.N. General Assembly , which must then approve the selection by majority vote . In practice , the power to select a new Secretary General rests with the Security Council , since the General Assembly has never rejected its nominee . A successful candidate must have the backing of nine of the Security Council 's 15 member states , including all five permanent members ( Britain , China , France , Russia , and the U.S. ) . As a result , the selection is subject to the veto of any of the five permanent members of the Security Council . S/he is not elected by the citizens in direct voting.By convention , the position rotates by geographic region . And as of now , there has not yet been a Secretary-General from North America or Oceania .",0

The city was systematically burned for somewhere between 10 and 17 days . Then the city walls , its buildings and its harbor were utterly destroyed and the surrounding territory was supposedly sown with salt to ensure that nothing would grow there again .",0

"A Statistical Evaluation of Multiplicative Congruential Generators ? what the main idea ? This is a cool question . The main idea is to check how random a random number generator really is.A random number generator is a system , usually involving a computer which creates a list of random numbers . All random number generators are really pseudo-random , which just means that unless there is some bizzare input , like static from a radio , the list of numbers is predictable and therefore not really random.For example an example of a simple random number generator is one of a pair of dice . The die will always show a number from 1 to 6 . If you wrote down zillions of rolls of the die , and made a bar chart , a really fair die would show equal length bars for each number . This is an example of an Statistical Evaluation . Other evaluations might be to show what the bar chart curve looks like ( bell curve etc . ) , or the average etc.Fair random number generators are important for gambling machines , state lotteries , scientific testing , and mathematics.The most famous multiplicative linear congruential generator was RANDU invented by IBM in 1968 . By multiplying numbers together one after another using modulo arithmetic ( like the way a clock repeats every 12 hours ) based on a starting number or SEED , it was a simple way to get numbers . Unfortunately , statistical tests showed it was way off . The numbers fell into patterns which were not random .",0

"Does anyone have and want to share a routine to calculate fourier coefficient for even Mathieu 's Function Calc Classes of Solutions to Mathieu 's Equation Floquet 's theorem asserts that any solution to the Mathieu equation ( Eq . gif ) is of the form : [ 4,29,28 ] where is either real or imaginary and is a -periodic functiongif of . This assertion implies that solutions of Eq . gif can be separated into the product of a term of the form and a series of harmonics , , each of which is -periodic in . For values of with a non-zero imaginary component and , Eq . gif indicates that : Thus , , yields an unbounded solution to the Mathieu equation . On the other hand , values of which are purely real yield bounded , oscillatory solutions for .There are two types of bounded solutions to Mathieu 's equation : functions of fractional order and functions of integral order . Functions of fractional order are obtained for . The oscillatory periods of the frequencies associated with fractional-order Mathieu functions are non-integer multiples of . The special case of corresponds to an -periodic ( in terms of ) solution . These -periodic solutions are Mathieu functions of integral order.All bounded solutions to the Mathieu equation -- - those of fractional as well as integral order -- - are described ( in accordance with Floquet theory ) by an infinite series of harmonic oscillations whose amplitudes decrease with increasing frequency : The argument of in Eq . gif represents harmonics of frequency , while the term represents a ( secular ) frequency which is a function of the trap specifications ( or , equivalently , of the Mathieu parameters a , q ) . The Mathieu parameters and also determine the coefficients , which approach zero as n increases . [ 36 ]",0
"Is LeBron James the next Michael Jordan ? Both number 23 ... Well , the thing that made Jordan great was not his skills . Yes he was a great player ( possibly one of the top two along with Wilt Chamberlain ) , he was a complete player . He could do everything excellently . He scored 30 points per game , grabbed over 5 boards , 3-4 assits , 2-3 steals , and even one season averaged a block per game . He was an all-around excellent player . There are other players even in his era who had just as many skills and were just as talented with natural ability . Scottie Pippen I think had more natural potential as was more graceful . Certainly Dominique Wlikens was more powerful.The thing that made Jordan great was his intelligence and his primacy ; his ability to get up for a game and take it to the next level . He thrived on pressure . He could get into another players head and totally shut them down from the inside out . When the game was on the line he took the game to another emotional level that had so much stress and pressure to it that every other opposing player was crushed by it and all his teammates fed off of it . Jordan 's natural talent was limited . He was n't even picked for his high school team the first time around . Lebron only went to high school . He is not mentally the same player as Jordan , and he never will be .",0

"Instant Fire - Just Add Water ? I thought of this out of the blue and I was wondering if it would actually work ( in priciple ... I realize that there are a lot of engineering hurdles to overcome ) .Take powdered potasium and powdered magnesium . Add a little water . The water and potasium will react , producing heat and hydrogen . The heat will ignite the hydrogen which , in turn will will ignite the magnesium ... instant fireWill this actually work ? MistWing SilverTail adding water to potassium already causes it to explode . you are correct - the reaction releases hydrogen and forms an oxide of potassium , and the considerably exothermic nature of the reaction generates enough heat to ignite the hydrogen gas . so , mixing water and potassium solid typically causes a big-time explosion - just like mixing water and sodium.as for the powdered magnesium in there - i suspect that the explosion would scatter it , and it might ignite - the ignition temperature for magnesium metal is 450 C - so you 'd probably end up with white-hot burning magnesium shrapnel flying everywhere ! so , if you 're ever thinking about making a nasty bomb , sounds like a good way to do it .",0

That is a very serious relationship and I need him to know . How will he react , I would you react ... Could he get excited about that fact ? Could he think that I am not a good girl ? What kind of questions will he ask ? Do NOT bring up the topic about how many people you 've been with . It 's all in your past , and is irrelevant in your current relationship . If I found out my girlfriend had been with 40 guys , she would be my ex-girlfriend pretty soon . Sex and intimacy is something that is shared between 2 people , and it is special . When it 's been shared with 40 people , it 's not special anymore , it 's like a piece of meat on public display.Be monogamous with this guy . Good luck .",0

"how to correct red eye in photography ? If you want to eliminate red-eye before your photo even makes it into the computer : Red eye is caused when flash is fired directly into the eye , bounces off the red blood vessels at the back of the eye , and is reflected back into the lens.The solution would be to fire the flash at an angle , for example , downwards towards the subjects , rather than right at them . This would require an external flash unit that has a swivel head , and of course , for inexpensive point and shoots , this is not really an option , but I put it out there . Not only will you eliminate red eye but you will greatly improve the look of your photos is you learn how to use an external flash unit properly and bounce light off nearby walls.Or , in some cases , why not turn off the flash altogether and prop your camera against a surface or use a tripod , and get the subjects to stay still a little . Not possible when you 're in the middle of the action , or in very poorly lit areas , but sometimes doable . Your pictures will be a lot better off without the harsh light that those built in flash units provide .",0

I was spanked when necessary but not , of course , beaten in any way . My cousins , on the other hand , were never spanked or even smacked to save them from doing something stupid or harmful . My cousins , I have to admit , are some of the most spoiled & self-centered adults that I have EVER come across . Only one even approaches what I would consider normal & I think that this is only because she got lucky when she got married ... he makes a fortune & she does n't have to worry about anything other than taking care of their kids & shopping . Still , she 's quickly learning that she ca n't raise her kids the way she was raised . The other two ?

If they had , they might have answered the question better . If shot into major artery , the vicitm would probably die of blood loss .

"Should there be a law concerning credit related lawsuits ? Now that congress has passed the new bankruptcy laws that do not allow credit obligations to be totally wiped clean , this has given creditors free reign to file lawsuits for bad credit . The amount of lawsuits are jumping high as it is forcing people to file bankruptcy which under the new rules forces them to pay regardless . This use to be bad policy for creditors as it created bad business for consumers . Do creditors have right to sue consumers with money they have made off of consumers ? Should credit be regarded as an investment made by a creditor to a consumer and if that investment goes bad to not cry about it ? Are in likewise manner people allowed to sue companies and stock brokers if our investments are lost for one reason or another ? So if that can not be allowed should corporations be allowed to sue consumers for their own bad investments ? Should this be allowed or should congress amend the law to disallow lawsuits for credit obligations ? Although we may like to think better of our society , credit card companies wield a tremendous amount of lobbying power . However , can you imagine knowing that you will be exonerated from your credit obligations ; what would be the incentive to pay .

If you take a 1/2 '' diameter steel pin and it is 1 '' long and you put 100 lbs on one end and the other end on the ground , you put 100lbs/.20in*in or 500 psi into the pin . Now visualize the pin being crushed under this load . The 1 '' distance between the end faces is no longer 1 '' . Say a measurement shows that under this load the pin is 0.998 '' . The strain , measured in inches per inch , is the change .002 '' divided by the length . In this case .002/1=.002 inches per inch . So the strain would be .002 in/in . ( In real life , the strain from a 100 lb load on a steel 1/2 '' pin would be very difficult to measure . ) See Poisson 's ratio which specifically deals with the different strain rates based on material properties .",0

"If a married guy at work is always staring at my breasts does that mean he is interested in me ? May seem obvious , but maybe guys just like looking at breasts and I know nothing about the way guys think . He stares pretty much the whole time we are talking and pretty blatantly . Since he is so blatant does he know that I know and wants me to know or can he be totally oblivious and thinks I do n't know ? I do n't actually mind , since he is pretty attractive . Putting feelings aside and trying to JUST answer your question ... If the guy is saring at your breasts and is obvious about it , I do n't think he is so taken with the `` twins '' that he does n't know you see him . Again putting feelings aside ... If you are interested in him and want to know for sure make a pass at him or get him alone and flash him . Good luck ! ( As for my feelings ... I kinda agree with the others . He is married and even if he is interested , it seems like he is a dog and only interested in a date with the `` twins '' )",0

"In politics what does The Right & The Left mean ( what connection to Democrats/Republicans ) ? The left and right ends of the political spectrum discribe people 's basic philosopy of government . Most people think of Democrats of being left center and liberals comfortably in the left and Socialists at the extreme left . On the right side , Republicans would be near the center , Conservatives comfortable in the right and libetarians at the far right.The right tends to favor policies in which the role of the government is extremely limited , especially when it comes to promoting the general welfare of the populous , but at the same time spending adequate resouces for the common defense of the nation such as the military and the enforcement of international trade agreements . Some issues that the Right traditionally cares about are : * Minimize Taxes* Minimize Social Welfare Programs ( Social Security , Medicaid , Medicare ) * Minimize Regulations on Business and Individuals* Elimination of Wealth Redistribution policies such as Progressive Taxation , Asset Based Taxation , and Taxation on Income gained through investment or inheritance . * Minimize ability of citizens to sue the government or corporations , or other individuals based on laws designed to protect the environment , consumers , workers , women , minorities , etc ... .Recently , the Right has embraced other non traditional issues such as : * Increased government regulation of Abortion* Increased government regulation of End of Life decisions* Increased government regulation of Drug Usage* Increased Government funding of Christian religious groups , symbols and priorities . * Increased Government regulation of sexual pratices , indecent speech , homosexuality and unpatriotic behavior . * Decreased regulation of weapon ownership . * Support for public execution of certain criminals . * Reduction of constitutional gaurantees for accused criminals ( Victims Rights ) The left tends to favor a stronger government with policies which benefit the general population at the expense of those in positions of power . People on the left tend to believe that the government 's primary function is to provide for the general welfare of its citizens paid for by taxing the populous . Some issues that the left traditionally cares about are : * Generous funding of Social Programs ( Social Security , Medicaid , Medicare ) * A progressive tax system which taxes wealthy individuals at a higher rate and taxes income earned by means other than work ( Profits , Investment , Inheritence ) higher than work income . * Increased government regulation of employers , polluters , manufacturers , and individuals in the interests of protecting the populous* Protecting Certain Freedoms such as freedom of speech , freedom of the press , right to privacy , voting rights , rights of the accused , etc ... .Recently , the Left has embraced other non traditional issues such as : * Legalization of Abortion* Affirmative Action* Increased regulation of weapon Ownership* Less strict Immigration laws* Opposition of certain wars* Separation of Church and State",0

"why are people so ignorant about the Pagan based religions or witchcraft ? Well , you are certain to get a bunch of Christians jumping on this one , which may be an answer in itself . Much ignorance is due to having a different point of view ( usually christian , but perhaps other `` standard '' religions as well ) that prevents you from seeking real facts.Secondly , the pagan mysteries have long protected themselves , hiding behind symbols , misdirection and so on , because of persecution . Remember the burning times ! ( i.e. , the inquisition . ) Also , I think many modern pagans , witches , wicca , ( use what term you will ) , believe that only a small percentage of people are capable of being a part of the pagan world : one might almost call it snobbery . Think of Malfoy and his contempt for anyone who is not born a `` pureblood '' witch or wizard . You think Rawlings pulled that out of pure imagination ?

"How do u make an ice-rink in ur backyard ? ? ? ? ? ? I want 2 make 1 but i dont no how . I made a workable ice rink for my daughter in our back yard while she was very young . She later competed in figure skating competitions.At a hardware store , buy a roll of plastic that opens as wide and at least as long as your rink will be . The plastic is only a few mils thick and usually comes in black or clear , for example it is used as a painting drop cloth , etc . The thicker the better . Clear will absorb less sunlight avoiding melting.Lay out the rink using a tape measure to a length and width slightly less than the dimensions that tthe single sheet of plastic sheet will be . Overlapping sheets may drain unless poured slowly in very cold weather . Before the ground is frozen , dig a trench all around the rink inside your lines and make a pile of soil all around the outside of the trench that will be slightly higher than the ground inside the rink . Lay down the plastic sheet over the ground and trench and piled earth . Fill the plastic covered ground with water nearly to the top of the earth piles and let it freeze . Add more watter if needed.You can make your rink square or rectangular or even oval and size will depend on the plastic sheet and your space available . Do not walk on the plastic sheet because you may make drain holes . A double layer of plastic would help avoid puncture from sharp stones , etc . Try to build on very level ground as water will seek a level surface . Try to build away from anything that could cause injury if a skater lost control or fell outside the rink . Try to avoid skating on the edge which would cut the plastic and allow water to drain during a thaw . Perhaps provide a piece of old carpet where skaters have to step over the edge . Do enjoy ! Good luck.BTW our pump water had a lot of mineral and did not make good ice . City water or rain water would have been much better - but it worked !",0

"do you know any history on offset printing , who it was invented by and when they invented it ? The first lithographic offset printing press was created in England around 1875 and was designed for printing on metal . The offset cylinder was covered with specially treated cardboard that transferred the printed image from the litho stone to the surface of the metal . About five years later , the cardboard covering of the offset cylinder was changed to rubber , which is still the most commonly used material.The first person to use an offset press to print on paper was probably American Ira Washington Rubel in 1903 . He got the idea accidentally by noticing that whenever a sheet of paper was not fed into his lithographic press during operation , the stone printed its image to the rubber-covered impression cylinder , and the next impression had an image on both sides : direct litho on the front and an image from the rubber blanket on the back . Rubel then noticed that the image on the back of the sheet was much sharper and clearer than the direct litho image because the soft rubber was able to press the image onto the paper better than the hard stone . He soon decided to build a press which printed every image from the plate to the blanket and then to the paper . Brothers Charles and Albert Harris independently observed this process at about the same time and developed an offset press for the Harris Automatic Press Company soon after .",0

"Does cell confluency matter when conducting an experiement ? I recently plated some cells ( transfected ) and treated them with compounds . Turns out they died and a theory is that confluency was a little higher than usual and compounds prompted inhibition of cell growth . Purpose of the compound was prevention of hiv replication via initial stages of attachment . Many ( perhaps most ) cells stop growing when the reach confluence ( this is called `` Contact inhibition '' ) . Generally , they do not die when they hit confluence , but certainly it will change the way they react to drug treatment and could be relevant .",0

"How does one become a taxidermist ? I am looking for a career , but I can not and will not learn Algebra . Any suggestions ? IntroductionTaxidermy programs prepare people to create lifelike models of wildlife and fish . Students learn how to select materials from dead animals and how to use artificial resources such as glass , wax , and foam . They study methods to create needed parts and care for models . In addition , they learn to manage a business and advertise their services.OverviewThe Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti once said that `` the object of art is not to reproduce reality , but to create a reality of the same intensity . '' As an art form , taxidermy does exactly this.Contrary to popular belief , taxidermists do not take dead animals and stuff them for display . Although this practice used to exist , most taxidermists would frown upon this mere attempt to `` reproduce reality . '' Instead , taxidermists are artists who re-create `` a reality of the same intensity '' by using a combination of artificial resources and natural materials from animal corpses.If you 've ever been to a museum of natural history or science , you may have seen the work of a taxidermist . You might have seen the form of an antelope 's head mounted on wood or a lifelike representation of a jackrabbit in a setting crafted to look like a forest clearing.As a taxidermist , you help to preserve the memory of animals . Just as other artists do , you pay close attention to details that others might not notice . You look at color , texture , expression , and muscle movement . You combine crafts such as carpentry , woodworking , tanning , and molding and casting to give renewed life to these details . You also use the artistic talent required for drawing , sculpting , and painting.You might show your work at competitions , in shops and museums , or in the private homes of your customers.In taxidermy programs , you learn to build frames and forms to substitute for animal skulls and skeletons . You study the techniques for sculpting clay heads or bodies and finishing models with painting and preservation . You also learn to preserve animal components such as skin , feathers , and fur.Proprietary schools and some community colleges offer taxidermy programs . You can typically earn a certificate which takes anywhere from a few weeks to a year of full-time study after high school . ''",0

"Can i install a intercooler on my car w/o the turbo ? intake hose on 1 tube & the air filter side of intercoole You can install anything you want . The real question should be : Will intercooling help performance of a non-turbo car . The reason for the intercooler is to decrease the temperature of the forced air generated by the turbo . Consider the fact that it is compressed air generated by hot exhaust gases which turn the vane in the turbo . By cooling the air generated by the turbo , you can increase the power capability . You can research air/air intercoolers and even water/ice/air intercoolers on yahoo search.To answer your question , yes you could install one but you would likely see no performance gain and maybe even a drop . This is due to the additional volume added to the intake tract by the piping and intercooler itself . Your best bet is a cold air intake which you can buy from most any aftermarket parts place .",0

"' ... .and war broke out in heaven.. ' ? what could this possibly have been like ? please indulge me with your imagination , thank you .

The Bible book of Revelation describes what happened : “ And war broke out in heaven : Michael and his [ good ] angels battled with the dragon [ Satan ] , and the dragon and its [ bad ] angels battled but it did not prevail , neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven . So down the great dragon was hurled , the original serpent , the one called Devil and Satan , who is misleading the entire inhabited earth ; he was hurled down to the earth , and his [ bad ] angels were hurled down with him. ” What was the result ? The account continues : “ On this account be glad , you heavens and you who reside in them ! ” The good angels could be glad because Satan and the bad angels , or spirits , were no longer in heaven . But what about people on earth ? The Bible says : “ Woe for the earth and for the sea , because the Devil has come down to you , having great anger , knowing he has a short period of time. ” —Revelation 12:7-9 , 12.Yes , Satan and his wicked companions mislead and cause great woe for people on earth .

"In calculus , could you explain the process of intergrating by substitution ? teacher doesnt explain very well When you are doing integrations , all you are doing is computing an area under a curve . Sometimes the formula for the area will be obvious to you , from something you already know or recognize . Othertimes , you have to transform the problem into one you know already . This is the method called integration by substitution . For example , suppose you want to integrate the function sqrt ( 1 - x^2 ) with respect to x , between some limits . Most times , you will not remember or recognize this integral . However , you might remember that sqrt ( 1- ( sin a ) ^2 ) is cos a , which you know how to integrate , and therefore if you let x=sin a , you have transformed the integral into one you recognize and can easily solve . There is a HUGE amount of material written on this on the internet and in books , but this should get you started . All you are doing is transforming the problem into one that you can solve easier .",0

"Does Koran recognize Jews ’ ‘ Deed of Ownership ’ regarding Palestine as the Promised Land ? `` That land , the Promised Land , was given by God to the Jews in the Bible , which is our Deed of Ownership , an ownership recognized in the Kuran itself ! `` I asked a question 2 hours ago .

For details , please see that answer . http : //answers.yahoo.com/question/ ; _ylt=Am9iPSwhQW.CBlEttT2gKzwjzKIX ? qid=1006021203731 Koran recognizes Jews and their prophet , Mosa as well as Christians and their prophet Jesus . Koran also recognizes that Jerusalem is the Holy Land of Jews . But this ca n't interpreted as a deed of ownership . Jews always try to distort it by purpose in order to make Moslims to serve them for the establishment of Big Israel State between two rivers , exactly like how they convince Christians that it is a Christian duty to support Jews cause they are chosen , etc.Moslims are not taught to be hate Jews . Moslims respect them and the fact that Jerusalem is their Holy Land . Their greedy unrealistic Big Israel Utopia which is covering whole Middle East and their violance in Palestine make Moslims hate them . See , we respect them , their Holy Land , but as usual , it is not enough , they ask for the deed of ownership .

"What are the best studio monitor speakers for under $ 500 ? I assume here that you are asking about nearfield active monitors , and that you are aiming for sub- $ 500 for the pair ( not each ) . There are a few factors which play into the decision , including ( a ) the type of music you will be working with , ( b ) your workstation setup , and ( c ) the room.The type of music can determine whether or not you need a subwoofer . If you do , that 's an additional component which you will need to factor into your overall budget.The workstation setup will play into the positioning and power of the speakers . How much space do you have ? Where will the speakers go , and will they be near any walls or corners ? How will they be positioned relative to your head ? ( assuming nearfield ) The room can play a bit into the monitor decision , but it 's probably a bit more of a factor in tuning your setup once you have your monitors . Look into room acoustics as you 're making your monitor decision to understand what your overall monitoring/room setup will entail.Having thought a bit about the above , the key thing for monitors is to have something sufficiently detailed and revealing to make accurate mixes . Ideally , it wo n't be too fatiguing , as you will most likely be listening to them for extended periods of time . On top of that , it 's mostly a matter of getting accustomed to them so you can make accurate mixing decisions . The net of all of this is that monitor choices are fairly personal . Keep in mind that the goal is to get something accurate which will allow you to hear everything you need to hear , which is NOT the same as `` sounding good '' . Take some CDs and audition your top candidates against music you know well , focusing on key portions that highlight particular ranges or potential problem areas ( extended low bass , detailed highs , stereo imaging , etc . ) It can help to take some of your own mixes , if possible.Some specific inexpensive monitors I 've heard good things about are the KRK Rokits and the lower-end Events . Again , the key is to be familiar with the speakers so you can make accurate mixes .",0
"Why Iran Should Stop Researching on Nuclear Knowlage ? With all due respect , sgt_k is a total idiot , learn how to respect others ' opinion then start talking ... back to the topic , well , yes , i agree with yunussh ... for the following reasons : 1- we have known what is the meaning of being told by america that somebody or a country is having a mass destruction weapons , it 's a big lie like what happened in iraq , but iran would never let america do the same thing , simply iran can make what the american would never expect . 2- we know that israel has a nuclear power , it threats all the muslims around it , who knows if they have n't already invent a bomb with a short range of action that , for example , can destroy egypt without affecting israel itself ? , that 's why , countries near israel has the right to defend themselves in the way they can , you ca n't stop iran unless you assure the whole world is having nothing called nuclear power . 3- america is doing all that because of israel , techniquely speaking , iran ca n't threat amecrica in a way or another ! they are thousands of kilos far away , but when it is about israel , yes america can do any idiot step for the sake of israel , why ? because isreal , 10 million people , is controlling every single step america is doing , shame on you american ! finally , do n't ever dream that what happened to iraq will repeat itself , , , american soldiers themselves wo n't accept a new war and now they know that a muslim can really be happy to die when it 's about making strangers out of his country , , leave us alone , or u never be in peace ... gourge bush or any other president , american will never elect a president who hates israel , that 's why we never expcet a good thing from you , america .. now , was it convincing ?",0

Every single time she thinks about braking up with him she cant shes been saying the same thing for about for half a year and nothing happened some edvice please ? ? If she ca n't break up with him I believe that only means she has developed feelings for him , or else it would have been a lot easier for her . Otherwise , she might be feeling sorry for him assuming he might get upset and hurt , which also means she 's with him for the wrong reasons . If your friend has no feelings for him , and is not attached to him emotionally , then she should leave him and be fair to him , and most importantly to herself .",0

"What is the wicca religon ? I have always wondered . Wicca is a Neopagan religious movement found in many different countries , though most commonly in English-speaking cultures . Wicca was first publicised in 1954 after the repeal of the British Witchcraft Act , by a British civil servant named Gerald Gardner . He claimed that the religion , of which he was an initiate , was a modern survival of an old witch cult , which had existed in secret for hundreds of years , originating in the pre-Christian Paganism of Europe . Wicca is thus sometimes referred to as the Old Religion . The veracity of Gardner 's claims is now much debated , and it is thought that much if not all of Wiccan theology was established no earlier than the 1920s . Since its founding , various related Wiccan traditions have evolved , or been adapted from , the form established by Gardner , which came to be called Gardnerian Wicca . These other traditions of Wicca each have specific beliefs , rituals , and practices . Most traditions of Wicca remain secretive and require members to be initiated , however there is a growing movement of Eclectic or Solitary Wiccans who adhere to the religion but do not believe a traditional initiation is necessary . Gardnerian Wicca is perhaps the most popular of the traditions excepting Solitary Wicca . you can find more information also in the address that i give you",0

Well , it 's obvious that you are not black . Being one of those black folks myself I can say without hesitation that the use of the N-word is most certaintly NOT 'okay ' , regardless of who says it .

"How are geodes formed , where are found and what minerals do they contain ? Geodes ( Greek geoides , `` earthlike '' ) are geological formations common to the United States ( Indiana , Iowa , and Kentucky ) , Brazil , and Mexico . Essentially rock bubbles with internal crystal formations , the exterior of a geode is generally limestone or a related rock , while the interior contains quartz crystals and/or chalcedony deposits . Other geodes are completely filled with crystal , being solid all the way though . These types of geodes are called nodules.Geologists do not yet have a widely accepted theory about how geodes are formed , but it is believed geodes can form in any cavity that is buried . These can be bubbles in igneous rocks , pockets under tree roots , bubbles in lava after a volcanic eruption , or even animal burrows . Over time , the external wall of the cavity hardens , and dissolved silicates and/or calcites are deposited on the inside surface . Over time , this slow feed of minerals allows crystals to form inside the hollow chamber . Then , over millions of years , the geode makes its way back to the surface through normal geologic processes.Follow the link for more information.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geode",0

"Are you a Calvinist or an Armenian ? Explain why and back up your position with Bible verse please ? Please only serious answers . Calvinist . [ Arminians ] ... say that the Augustinian tradition subordinates the love of God to the will of God ... But this is not what distinguishes the Augustinian tradition from the Arminian tradition . The distinction is between intensive and extensive love , between an intensive love that saves its loved ones , and an extensive love that loves everyone in general and saves no one in particular . Or if you really wish to cast this in terms of willpower , it 's the distinction between divine willpower and human willpower . Or , to put the two together , does God will the salvation of everyone with a weak-willed , ineffectual love , or does God love his loved ones with a resolute will that gets the job done ? The God of Calvin is the good shepherd , who names and numbers his sheep , who saves the lost sheep and fends off the wolf . The God of Wesley is the hireling , who knows not the flock by name and number , who lets the sheep go astray and be eaten by the wolf . Which is more loving , I ask ? - Steve HaysJohn 10:7-9 ( NKJV ) Then Jesus said to them again , `` Most assuredly , I say to you , I am the door of the sheep . [ 8 ] All who ever came before Me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not hear them . [ 9 ] I am the door . If anyone enters by Me , he will be saved , and will go in and out and find pasture . John 6:44 ( NKJV ) No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him ; and I will raise him up at the last day . John 6:45 ( NKJV ) It is written in the prophets , 'And they shall all be taught by God . ' Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me . John 15:16 ( NKJV ) You did not choose Me , but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit , and that your fruit should remain , that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you . Ephes . 1:4-5 ( NKJV ) just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love , [ 5 ] having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself , according to the good pleasure of His will , Romans 8:29-30 ( NKJV ) For whom He foreknew , He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son , that He might be the firstborn among many brethren .

"Why does metal spark in the microwave ? The short answer is : Microwaves bombard the metal with radio waves ( electrons ) . Where that energy builds up , it can build to the point the energy will arc to another spot . Works great with crumpled foil , or CD-ROM 's you do n't want to use anymore . Quoth Wikipedia : `` ... the pointed ends of the fork will act to concentrate the electric field formed at the tips . This has the effect of exceeding the dielectric breakdown gradient of air , about 3 megavolts per meter ( 3×106V/m ) , causing sparks to form . This effect is directly analogous to the effect of St. Elmo 's fire. '' P.S . According to Mythbusters , you CAN NOT damage your microwave by putting metal objects in it for short periods of time . You would have to microwave metal a LOT for it to overload the magnetron and cause damage ( most magnetrons in consumer microwaves have overload protection anyway ) . Try microwaving a CD you do n't need anymore upside-down in your microwave for 2-5 seconds , and watch the miracle of radio lithography ( just do n't do it to the point the plastic melts , or who knows what kind of toxic fumes you might release from the plastic ) .",0

"When God created the world , He made one . Why then are our skins different & We marry when we should be sibbling There was a time when people were hunter-gatherers and lived a nomadic lifestyle . Because of this , the population spread throughout the world . Over time , peoples ' skin colors changed to adapt to the amount and intensity of the sun where they lived . For example , people closer to the equator developed darker skin because they got a lot of sunlight and people closer to the poles developed lighter skin because they got a lot less sunlight . That 's why people have different skin colors . Why do people marry when we are really all distant relatives ? Well , if the Biblical accounts are to be accepted , the simple truth is that we do marry our far-distant relatives . In fact , in the South , when a person marries , one of the questions on the marriage application is , `` are you related by blood ? '' . It is not uncommon in that area of the country , and is allowed by law , for second cousins to marry .",0

"How can you ? how can you tell that chlorine is a gas at room temperature ? Well , do you know about intermolecular forces ? There are four types of intermolecular forces : 1 . London dispersion2 . Dipole-dipole3 . Hydrogen bonding4 . Ion-dipoleThe weakest of these four forces is the first one , London dispersion , which happens to be the only one that chlorine molecules exert on each other . Chlorine molecules ( Cl2 ) are diatomic and nonpolar ( two identical atoms bonded together can not have polarity because they pull on the electrons with the same strength ) . That means that they only exert London dispersion forces on each other , which is weak . That means that chlorine molecules are n't really attached to each other that well , so they can just fly away from each other as gas very easily . This is why chlorine is a gas at room temperature , and that 's how you can tell ( or at least make a smart prediction ; it 's hard to know for sure ) with chlorine and other molecules and compounds . Figure out what kind of intermolecular forces you 're dealing with .",0

"do u know about natual disaster concepts ? tsunami , cyclones , earth quakes A natural disaster is a catastrophe that occurs when a hazardous physical event ( such as a volcanic eruption , earthquake , landslide , hurricane , or any of the other natural phenomena listed below ) precipitates extensive damage to property , a large number of casualties , or both . In areas where there are no human interests , natural phenomena do not result in natural disasters.A cyclone is the rotation of a volume of air about an area of low atmospheric pressure . Cyclones are responsible for a wide variety of different meteorological phenomena such as tropical cyclones and tornadoes . Because of this , most weather forecasters avoid using the term cyclone without a qualifying term.An earthquake is a sudden and sometimes catastrophic movement of a part of the Earth 's surface . Earthquakes result from the dynamic release of elastic strain energy that radiates seismic waves . Earthquakes typically result from the movement of faults , planar zones of deformation within the Earth 's upper crust . Most earthquakes are tectonic , but they also occur in volcanic regions and as the result of a number of anthropogenic sources , such as reservoir induced seismicity , mining and the removal or injection of fluids into the crust.A tsunami is a series of waves generated when water in a lake or the sea is rapidly displaced on a massive scale . Earthquakes , landslides , volcanic eruptions and large meteorite impacts all have the potential to generate a tsunami . The effects of a tsunami can range from unnoticeable to devastating .",0

"what is human relation in business psychology ? The human relations movement was initiated by psychologists and employment experts in the United States in the 1920s . The movement viewed workers in terms of their psychology and fit with companies , rather than as interchangeable parts.This view was advanced in reaction to the efficiency focus of Taylorism in the early 1900s . Though human resources have been part of business and organisations since the first days of agriculture , the modern concept of human resources was codified by advocates of a human relations view.This movement grew throughout the middle of the 20th century , placing emphasis on how leadership , cohesion , and loyalty played important roles in organizational success , and on the value of participatory management . Although this view was increasingly challenged by more quantitatively rigorous and less `` soft '' management techniques in the 1960s and beyond , human resources had gained a permanent role within the firm .",0

"How many jumps are there in each set of volleyball match for each player ? At lower levels of play , e.g. , recreational leagues , the number of jumps varies by the player 's ability . The best players ( on recreational teams ) gets the lion-share of the sets , and thus , jumps a lot more than others . The ratio between best and worst players on the court could mean 25 jumps to zero . Additionally , the offense usually consists of `` high outside '' sets , with no `` quick attack '' in the middle , and thus , reduced the number of jumps required to block . However , at higher levels of play , the number of jumps varies by position more than ability . The least number of jumps go the outside hitters , both power and weak-side ( a/k/a , `` opposite '' ) . Their numbers are roughly inverses of each other , for obvious positional reasons . Figure 9-12 spike attempts for power hitters , and 4-7 blocks ; the opposite hitter gets the opposite numbers : 4-7 spike attempts , and 9-12 spikes . The lion-share of jumps go to the middle hitters , who ( usually ) jump on every volley , because they need to jump before the setter sets the ball . Additionally , they participate in every block . Figure they get about 12-25 spike jumps , and the same number of blocks . Hope this very un-scientific answer helps .",0

All the more urgent is the Church 's call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism . a baby is a person created by God and a baby who 's died did have a soul .

"is a criminal justice a lawyer that goes to court and defends people ? is like what is the diference between pre law studies , criminal justice , law , advanced legal reaserch , coparative law and international law . Haha , no - criminal justice refers to the field of study that examines crime as a social phenomenon , and traditional focuses on the agents , procedures , and systems that societies create in order to deal with crime.Pre-law studies are just that ; they are tracks that some universities offer for those who want to go to law school and who may ( or may not ) know what area of law they want to get in to . From what I understand , these tracks usually consist of courses aimed at improving students ' oral and written communication skills , their critical/analytical thinking , and creativity . Most also provide a survey of the different kinds of law , as well as giving you a historical backdrop for the practice.Advanced legal research - I am not sure what you mean , but legal research in general refers to the process of digging up the legal matters surrounding some topic or issue . This is a complicated and tedious process , so I do n't know if legal research is ever NOT `` advanced . '' : - ) Comparative law studies laws between different countries ( e.g . British law versus Chinese law ) and between different legal systems ( e.g . common law versus civil law ) .International law studies the rules that govern conduct between independent states .

"Why is `` importantly '' being used so much these days ? This is a perfectly good word when used in the proper way . It is an adverb ... as in `` He dressed importantly for the meeting '' . Seems everyone today has tossed the english language . Most of the talking heads use `` more importantly ... '' . It 's been written a lot too . It should be `` more important ... '' It reminds me of the time when everyone was using the non-word , irregardless . They finally wised up on that one though . im·portant·ly adv . Usage Note : Some critics have objected to the use of the phrase more importantly in place of more important when one introduces an assertion , as in More importantly , no one is ready to step into the vacuum left by the retiring senator . But both forms are widely used by reputable writers , and there is no obvious reason for preferring one or the other. -- -- -- -- -- -ir·re·gard·less ( P ) Pronunciation Key ( r-gärdls ) adv . Nonstandard Regardless . [ Probably blend of irrespective , and regardless . ] Usage Note : Irregardless is a word that many mistakenly believe to be correct usage in formal style , when in fact it is used chiefly in nonstandard speech or casual writing . Coined in the United States in the early 20th century , it has met with a blizzard of condemnation for being an improper yoking of irrespective and regardless and for the logical absurdity of combining the negative ir- prefix and -less suffix in a single term . Although one might reasonably argue that it is no different from words with redundant affixes like debone and unravel , it has been considered a blunder for decades and will probably continue to be so .",0
"Who is MARAIH CAREY ? Mariah Carey , Singer Born : 27 March 1970 Birthplace : Huntington , New York Best Known As : Pop diva who sang `` We Belong Together '' Mariah Carey 's remarkable vocal range helped her gospel-influenced dance tunes reach the top of the pop charts in the early 1990s . Her hit albums included Mariah Carey ( 1990 ) , Music Box ( 1993 ) and Butterfly ( 1997 ) . Critics winked at Carey 's 1993 marriage to Tommy Mottola , the head of Sony Music and Columbia Records ( Carey 's label ) , but her vocal abilities and babe-appeal kept her in good standing with fans and made her a favorite on MTV . ( Carey and Mottola were divorced in 1998 . ) In 2001 Carey left Columbia to sign with EMI 's Virgin Records for a reported $ 100 million ; her first Virgin album , Glitter , the soundtrack to her semi-autobiographical 2001 movie , was widely considered a disappointment . In July of 2001 Carey was hospitalized for exhaustion , and the next month her publicists said that Carey was also receiving psychiatric treatment . The next year she split with EMI , which paid $ 28 million to buy out the remainder of her contract . By the end of 2005 she was at the top of the charts again , and her album , The Emancipation of Mimi , featuring the hit single , `` We Belong Together , '' earned 8 Grammy nominations .",0

"Anyone believe this years rise in the number of hurricanes was because researchers control our weather ? Just an interesting thought after having read Creighton 's `` State of Fear . '' You know , when my grandfather was a kid , the government and the military dreamed of controlling the weather . Now , 70 years later , the government has long since given up on the idea of controlling the weather . But now we have people running around screaming about global warming who are supposed `` experts '' in the field . We ca n't control the weather and bend it to our will so now they want us to believe that we can drastically alter it by ACCIDENT ? ! ? What arrogance ... . Michael Chrichton 's book was a work of fiction but his writing was solidly researched based on actual scientific data , not by waiting till the middle of August and then claiming that since it is 105 degrees outside , it must be due to `` global warming '' . What a riot . Why do you think the government refused to sign the kyoto accord ? Because of money ? Bull ... it was because it could not be scientifically verified . OK .

Insist on an `` on the water '' test when you find a boat you are serious about buying . If the seller declines , I would pass on the boat.Good luck in your search .",0

"George Reeves ( Superman ) Murder or Suicide ? George Reeves - Actor 1914-1959 George Keefer Brewer was born in Woolstock , Iowa on January 5 , 1914 . Probably best known for his acting career in the hit Superman TV series during the 1950 's George was a well accomplished film and play actor as well . He starred in numerous leading and supporting roles in a variety of famous films dating back to 1939 including the blockbuster `` Gone with the Wind '' where he portrayed one of Scarlet 's suitors.George Reeves was 45 years old in 1959 when he was found dead in his home from a single gun shot . Many people speculate that he was murdered but his death was ruled a suicide predicated on the fact that he was in a deep depression state due to his inability to find acting work because he was typecast as superman . I personally do not believe that he took his own life , this man was strong willed , full of life and had everything to live for.The circumstances of his mysterious death and the investigation that followed left many unanswered questions and speculation . On the evening of his death , George was entertaining his girlfriend and a few friends in his lavish Hollywood home when he reportedly went upstairs by himself to his bedroom . After about a half hour the guests heard a single gun shot and found George lying dead on his back across the side of the bed with his feet still on the floor . George was killed instantly my a German Luger pistol bullet that went through his skull and lodged in the wall above his bed near the ceiling . The shell casing from the bullet was found after the police picked him up , he had been laying on it . It is still unknown as to how the casing got there and how George could of been lying on the shell casing if he would have taken his own life . No suicide note was found , and there was never the slightest indication from George that he might be in a depressed state . This is one of those mysteries that we may never find out the real truth .",0

He knew how to bob and weave right under an opponent 's punches and come back with vicious combos to the head and body.However , I do n't think any heavyweight boxer ever could outbox Ali . Muhammad Ali knew how to use the ring and could use his reach advantage to keep Tyson at the perfect distance to land punches while avoiding being hit himself . Not that I do n't think Ali could n't take Tyson 's punches , but those body shots would have worn him down a bit by the later rounds.Overall , I say an unanimous decision victory for Ali , though not a very impressive one .",0

"Why are people considered racist if they do n't want illegal Mexicans in america even if they are ok withlegals People are often dubbed Racist if they support tougher immigration laws.If someone is angry at illegal Mexicans but ok with legal ones the are not racist.Lets face facts people at least 70 % of illegal immigration comes from Mexico.Those who propose tougher border laws are not big bad bigots , they are patriots wishing to protect this country and its economy and security . What exactly is `` handed off '' to illegal immigrants ? The general assumption that illegal immigrants are here to take what 's rightfully yours is as racist as it is ignorant.Immigrants ( legal or not ) come here looking for better opportunities and quality of life.Illegal immigrants are faced with hardships you could n't understand unless you became one . They are forced to work two and three different jobs making less than minimum wage and are taken advantage of because of their legal status.What 's ironic is that they pay taxes just like you and me.So ... they work harder for less money and on top of that pay taxes that pay the salaries of those politicians so thirsty to kick them out of the country.Going back to the original question ; those that do n't want illegal mexicans in this country are not racists . They just find it hypocritical that a group of people braking the law ( a federal one at that ) are protected by some politicians just to gain popular acceptance.To those of you that share the asker 's opinion that illegal immigrants are a threat to `` this country and its economy and security '' , I ask - how has illegal immigration affected you directly ? Did anybody get your dream job because they would do it for less money ? Did anybody get the low rent apartment you wanted ? ****** stoop_fer_lyfe ******I DO KNOW what I 'm talking about . I also live in a community riddled with illegal immigrants and am very close to many of them.What you fail to understand is that they buy new cars , buy houses or apartments and have credit cards - all things that need a credit report . Banks have changed credit requirements to accommodate them because financial institutions are not immigration officers , they are in business to make money and are not braking any law by lending money to someone that can provide Income Tax Returns . It may also be hard for you to believe that the government - regardless of the red flags it raises - accepts those Tax Returns and turns a blind eye to the migration legality of the issuer ; again , the IRS is not responsible for policing immigration laws.Maybe you have never filed a tax return , but you do n't need an employer to report and pay taxes for you . You are then 'Self-Employed ' , and you do n't necessarily need to report all your income since it ca n't be proved.Illegal immigrants know they can live very 'normal ' lives as long as they do n't break any laws other than immigration laws.It seems to me you are the one that DOES NOT KNOW what you are talking about and are merely commenting on what is fed to you by alarmist media . **************I actually enjoy these friendly exchanges.I realized why we are talking about two different illegal immigrants . You are talking about those that cross over illegally ( sneak in the country ) and I 'm talking about those that came here on a visa ( any kind ) and overstayed.The Social Security Administration used to provide SSN cards/numbers to people on temporary visas ; they were stamped with a big 'Not for employment use ' . I do n't have to tell you how easy those cards were to duplicate . I even saw a used car salesman photocopy one , remove those words and photocopy again until he ended with a 'clean ' copy before submitting the loan.On the subject of taxes ... during my college years I worked as a computer consultant , doing odd jobs that payed under $ 550 at a time , that way my 'employer ' did not have to submit a 1099 for professional services . I stayed under the radar and expensed every pencil , calculator , computer part , tool , etc . that I bought during those years .

There is alot that I enjoy about anime , most of which ca n't be summed up into words : D. The only ones I hate are : Pokemon , Digimon , Yugi-oh , and Reign . I 'm sure there are more but those are the only ones I can remember . Anyway , anime is great , those are my thoughts .",0

"Preparing a Solution ? How many grams of CaCl2 are needed to prepare 147.5 mL of a 1.270 M solution ? Please explain your answer so I can learn : D. Thanks ! 1 mole ( also represented as mol ) = 6.022x10^23 . This is just a number . Molecules are represented in mol quantities because they 're too small to work with otherwise . So that when you are dealing with CaCl2 in these problems , you 're actually using 6.022x10^23 molecules of CaCl2 . Additionally , when you see the molecular weight of a molecule , that is actually the weight of 1mol of that molecule.1M= 1mol/Litre . You need 1.27M . Divide 1.27 by 1,000 to find the number of mol CaCl2 per mL you need . ( 1.27/1,000=0.00127mol CaCl2/mL ) Multiply this by 147.5 to get the number of mol CaCl2 you will have . ( 0.00127*147.5= 0.187325mol CaCl2 ) Now multiply this number by the molecular weight of CaCl2 to get your answer ! ( 0.187325*110.984= 20.79g CaCl2 )",0

"What are the problems the No Child Left Behind Act has presented ? The biggest problem is that it makes teachers focus on teaching to a test rather than just teaching . Knowing how to take the test is more important , under this system , than knowing what is on it . Further , the act has been severely underfunded . The act requires more qualified teachers ( aka ones with more education ) , but more education means higher pay , which is something many school districts ca n't do.I think more importantly than any of those problems , there 's the issue of how to measure improvement . Under the act each class is compared to the previous class , meaning this year 's 2nd grade is compared to last year 's 2nd grade . Now , obviously comparing different groups of kids is fundamentally unfair . People do n't like to admit it , but some people have different base levels of intelligence . Certainly everyone who is not developmentally challenged should be able to pass high school reasonably , but to fault a school and its teachers simply because one class is , on average , not quite as smart is the most asinine thing I can think of . Thankfully the DOE is starting a pilot program of comparing student scores across their school careers ( comparing last year 's 2nd grade scores to this year 's 3rd grade scores ) . That is obviously the better way to do it , but making the switch is going to cost money , something the act has failed to provide .",0

"Who is Prophet Muhammad ? Muhammad ( , also transliterated Mohammad , Mohammed , Muhammed , and formerly Mahomet , following the Latin ) was an Arab religious and political leader and the final prophet of Islam . Islam is considered by Muslims to have existed prior to Muhammad , in the same tradition as Judaism and Christianity . Non-Muslims consider him the founder of Islam . According to traditional Muslim biographers , he was born c. 570 in Mecca ( Makkah ) and died June 8 , 632 in Medina ( Madinah ) ; both Mecca and Medina are cities in the Arabian Peninsula . Because of his success in spreading the final word of Islam and being successful both politically and on many other levels , Muhammad is considered to be one of the most influential people of all time.____For more information go to the website below .",0

"What 's a platypus ? It 's one of the few egg-laying mammals . It 's scientific name , Ornithorhynchus anatinus , means something like `` bird-beaked duck-like '' . Another good local name is `` duck-mole '' .In case you 've never seen one , try Google Image searchhttp : //images.google.com/images ? hl=en & lr= & rls=GGLC , GGLC:1969-53 , GGLC : en & q=ornithorhynchus % 20 & sa=N & tab=wiActually its `` beak '' is not hard as a bird 's , but covered with skin and extremely sensitive ( it can also sense low electric fields ) ; the animal uses it to explore the bottom of pools and small streams where it searches for food.Despite some `` reptilian '' features in their skeleton and anatomy , and the fact that their reproductive mode ( egg-laying ) is primitive for mammals , these animals are not `` primitive '' , they 're well adapted to their aquatic life : they have webbed feet , small eyes and almost no external ears , very thick fur and a flat tail that they use when swimming . Interestingly , platypuses are among the few venomous mammals : they have a `` spur '' in their hind feet associated with a venom gland that they use in fighting each other . Another interesting thing : adults do n't have teeth , they rely on ridged horny plates inside their mouth to crush the harder parts of the invertebrates that they feed on . However , juveniles do have functional molars with the same basic pattern as other mammals.They occur only in Australia at present , but fossil platypuses have been found in Patagonia , Argentina , so we know that their past distribution was wider.If you have the chance , watch the first episode of the David Attenborough 's series `` Life of mammals '' ; some of the best images of living monotremes I 've seen .",0

This will sound corny , but give it a shot : First , if you 've got kids , send them to the grandparents for the night in advance without him knowing ( say on a Friday ) . Next , turn off all the lights in the house and place scented candles in the bedroom and run a hot bubble bath just before he normally arives home . Have some wine and two wine glasses at the ready on the coffee table , and rose petals on the floor leading a trail to the bedroom -- or whereever you 're most memorable encounter that you can remember occurred . Personally , I like David Sanborn or some other smooth jazz playing in the background . Music is important to setting the mood , and if you 've got cable or a dish , you can tune it to the music of your choice . Just before he gets home , slip into a nice satin & lace nightie and cover it with a heavy robe . When he gets to the door , be there waiting to flash him and let him know what you 've got in store for the evening . Not in a crude way , mind you . Most importantly , take your time ... do n't rush . The anticipation of that which is to come will be as intense as the act itself . Hope that helps ! Peace , JayZ",0

"why does society say the skinnier you are , the prettier and more accepted you will be ? I think it 's based off of society valuing what influential and rich people that they iconize look like . The `` elite '' have the time and resources to devote to looking their `` best '' and usually that best is the opposite of what the average person in society looks like.In the US it 's hard to stay fit because most of us do n't have jobs that keep us physically fit ( or in the case of kids , they do n't `` get out and play '' as much as they used to ) . Also the cheapest food that is available is the worst for you but is the highest quantity that most people in the US consume which leads to so many people being overweight . So the opposite ( being skinny ) is what 's idolized . Mostly it 's wealthy people who have time to excersize and `` personal trainers '' and such to help them stay fit ... the rest of us are on our own.Back a few hundred years ago , if you were overweight it was a major status symbol because adequate nutrition was hard to come by , and if you had enough food to be fat , you must have been really well off . Again , what was attractive was the opposite of the average person who had to work hard at manual labor and probably did n't get enough to eat and so was skinny.Tanning is another example ... a while ago it was considered unattractive because if you were tanned it meant you were some serf working outside all day instead of being able to stay inside away from the sun . Now it 's the wealthy that have the most leisure time to spend outdoors so tanning is what 's considered attractive .",0

"How to test a prophet in the LAST DAYS - if he or she is true or a false ? See , i 'm newly converted and I read that GOD WILL POUR OUT HIS SPIRIT IN THE LAST DAYS on all flesh ? Is he gon na pour it on an unbeliever too ? since God says in `` ALL FLESH '' , your children will dream dreams and your daughters and sons will prophesy before the terrible day of God Almighty . So now , JESUS also made mention of FALSE PROPHETS . And our church has a prophet exclusively of their own.There has to be true prophets also in the Last DAYS as well with false prophets ... So which one is which ... ( Hope it 's OK i ask too many questions : ) hi.. First of all , I would like to congratulate you for choosing the way of Christ.I 'll try to answer your question to the best of my ability.I believe that when God speaks about All fleshin Joel 2:28 `` And i shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh ; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , your young men shall see visions . `` He meant the believers or someone who is being prepared for the Lord 's works.If you check sub chapters before that verse , God talks about A call to repentance and the land refreshed.The Lord obviously speaks about the people who repent and refreshed into the new creation in Christ ( believers ) .Thus , I conclude that All flesh , in Joel 2:28 , means All believersThat 's why it is important to always read at least a chapter or two before and after the verse.For the bible works as a whole ; we should avoid reading bible verses by chopping it individually . If we do that , there is a chance for us to take the verse out of the original context . And , yes there are still prophets appointed by God.and as it is true that there are true prophets , there are also false prophets/teachers.and your question is How we can tell the true from the false one , right ? there are 3 steps for us to know that a prophet is a false one or not:1 . God says `` My People perish from the lack of knowledge . '' It is very important for us to read the bible and pray everyday to build a sweet and intimate relationship with God . And also sharpen our knowledge about God 's characters.We know that Jesus has warned us about the false prophets/ messiahs in Matthew 24:24-28 . So , when there are news about messiahs that come to deliver us from sin , we knew that we have to be careful with those fake messiahs . We know in our heart that Jesus Christ is our only messiah that no one comes to the Father without going trough Him.2 . From reading the bible everyday and become more and more alert and sensitive to God 's voice , we knew that the true prophet sent by God will NEVER contradict the bible.So , when a teacher/prophets come to you and said that he is the messiah or something like you should divorce your husband , we know immediately that this prophet is a false teachers and should be avoided.Remember ! the bible is the ultimate guide that you should use to check whether a prophet is false or not.when they go against the bible , do n't waste your time.Pack your things and go.. Do n't bother listening to them.3 . What if the prophet looks and sounds fine for now ... but in the future , he will finally shown his true self . how do you know that he 's not going to trap you in his web of lies . For we know that the devil is cunning and deceitful.Well , go and look in matthew 7 : 15-20.It is okay and even recommended to test those people.Do n't accept them immediately just because they said they are prophets.Do n't be rude to them , but keep your Spiritual alert system on all the time.Test the fruits and the labors . For the things that came from the Lord always bring forth peace and goodness.Take whatever good and biblical inside . but , disregard the weird teachings . Keep alert and pray all the time for the Holy Spirit to reveal the truth to you about those prophets . Hopefully that helps , In jesus name , Amen",0

"can sata and pata raid work at the same time , so in `` my computer '' all the drives show up as a single space ? If you mean , can you combine both SATA and PATA drives in a single RAID , then the answer is yes , but not a hardware RAID.There are two kinds of RAID -- hardware and software . Hardware RAID is implemented by a hardware RAID controller , which is either part of your motherboard , or an add-in card . Software RAID is implemented by the operating system . Software RAID is slower than hardware RAID , but if you have a reasonably fast processor , it 's not using terribly much slower . If you have a slow processor , it will be slower , and more importantly , it will put a big load on your processor and make everything run slowly.To the best of my knowledge , there are no RAID controllers that will RAID an SATA drive with a PATA drive , but you can set up whatever RAID you want with software RAID . If you already have your drives in hardware RAID ( and intend to keep them that way ) then when you do this , you will be RAIDing the already-existing hardware RAIDs , since a hardware RAID is treated as a single drive on the `` software level '' .Here 's some info on software RAID in Windows : http : //www.techimo.com/articles/index.pl ? photo=149Here 's some info on software RAID in GNU/Linux : http : //www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.htmlHere 's some info on software RAID in Mac OS X : http : //www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/softraid3.htmlYou can find abundant info on doing software RAID on these and other operating systems by entering `` software RAID '' together with name of the operating system in a search engine .",0

"Does the sun really set when we see it disappear in the horizon or before ? My question is about optics . The short answer is : Yes.I think the previous people who attempted to answer this question did not read it carefully . The atmosphere is in layers , of different densities , that refract the sunlight and different colors different amounts . The light is bent downwards because the speed of light in the upper layers is greater than the speed of light in the layers closer to the ground . One can see this effect in the change in shape of the sun as it sets , and the effects like disconnected pieces of sun , green flashes , etc . This is just the same as the effect that creates mirages , or the spurious images of water on or above dry roads in the heat . So it is definitely true , that the sun has already gone below the horizon , when we still view its image .",0

"How do people steal and live with themselves ? Do n't you know you are the bottomfeeders of the earth ?

Therefore it is hard to live if you steal . However , if someone repeats crime over and over again his conciouseness get used to it more and more so he/she lives pretty good with stealing. -- Also , ( it is not excuse though ) , people can steal for a different purposes ... self-preservation most powerful probably ... 2 ) -- Second question I do n't uderstand .

"What is the phrase / ruling that a judge can make when he determines that a plaintiff is wasting time ? Is n't there a ruling that a Judge can make , or a argument defense can use when they believe that the plaintiff is continually stalling or trying to delay a ruling ? EG . We have tried to settle a number of times with the plaintiff , and each time he chooses to ignore the settlement , but then takes 4 - 5 months to come back with counter settlements or filing for trial dates . Then he rejects his own counter settlements or cancels the trial dates , and waits another 6 months before pursuing the case further . Some terms which might apply to this behavior : Vexatious - '' Vexatious '' means `` without reasonable or probable cause or excuse .

It seems like every thing I do is wrong , and conviction jumps on me and makes me feel so down . I feel like I 'm a million miles away from God . And all day long I 'm constanty thinking what I can do to please God . Can any one figure out what is wrong with me and my walk with Christ ? I just long for more of God to be in my life , and i can not stop thinking about Him , He 's on my mind all day long . We are called to rejoice and be glad ( Matt 5:11-12 ) . But we are also warned to be sober-minded ( Rom 12:3 ) . One of the most fearful verses I know that keeps me most sober is Matthew 7:21-23 : 21 “ Not everyone who says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter the kingdom of heaven , but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven . 22Many will say to me on that day , ‘ Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy in your name , and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles ? ’ 23Then I will tell them plainly , ‘ I never knew you . Away from me , you evildoers ! ’ You can not DO anything to please God . He is pleased with perfection . Jesus is perfection , and died for your sins in your place . Do good because he loves you , not to pay your way back `` in '' . Grace is a gift not deserved . See Romans 7 : 14-20.Love the Lord your God with Everything-Trust in Him .

"how is elementary school running in USA ? i.e. , financial support , administration roles , evaluation process , et My kids are going to elementary school , but I am not sure what is the current status of the system , in particularly I am interested in : ( 1 ) where the system gets its financial support ; ( 2 ) how to evaluate the system ; ( 3 ) who is in charge of the system ( 4 ) what are the requirements for the teachers and other staff ( 5 ) what are the roles of federal , state , and local goverments ( 6 ) what are the roles of parents and children themselvesThanks ! This varies wildly from state to state , from county to county , and from school to school . In the U.S. we have both public ( free attendance , supported by tax money ) and private schools . You should talk to the principal of the school your children are going to attend , as well as their teachers and parents of other students in their classes . Find out if there is a Parent-Teacher organization in the school and get involved . Talk to other parents in your neighborhood , at the playground and at church to get their impressions of local schools.Use sites like http : //www.greatschools.net/ to find out more information about schools in your area .",0

"Why does n't any one care about Africa ? First of all , I do n't think that 's a fair assessment . There are plenty of people who do in fact care very much about Africa and its people .

'' then I think you are hitting nearer the mark . I 'm no expert on Africa , but I think there 's a couple of reasons why it does n't peg a bit higher on the attention-o-meter insofar as the US is concerned . Hitherto , Africa has n't had a whole lot to offer us . Sounds harsh , I know , but it 's the truth . We are forced to deal with the Middle East because they are a big energy source , but if the oil was n't there we would n't be either . African oil is starting to become a market player now too , so some of our attention may be shifting towards that region.The other main reason is the perception that Africa is a continent filled with people who simply can not get their collective sh*t together . It 's brimming with petty dictatorships , bloody coups , transient goverments , unending civil wars and ethnic violence . In the international arena there just is n't anyone reliable to deal with on a nation-to-nation level . Our news stories have left me at least with the view that Africa is a limitless sinkhole into which all the world 's largesse could be poured without doing much more than fattening up a corrupt few at the top and financing more armies to fight in the wars and/or commit the heinous genocides we read about all too often.Do the African people suffer ? Of course they do ! Most of those organizations I listed at the top are all about addressing the suffering on the individual 's level . But until Africa starts to produce more responsible goverments , not too much will ever be done geopolitically to help them .",0

"Do Photons have any mass ? ( explain ) ? if yes , so why the Photon 's mass does n't increase while moving in the speed of light.and if no , so why a Photon hits an electron , the electron starts moving and the lights frequence increases ? ? ? It is not possible to experimentally measure something to have a value of exactly zero . The current limit on the mass of the photon is < 10^25 times lighter than the proton.The idea of a particle 's mass changing with velocity has not been used by serious physicists for several decades . We now rewrite the momentum equation asmomentum = gamma*mass*velocity , where the factor gamma describes the effect previously known as `` relativistic mass '' .The energy of a particle is energy = gamma * mass * c^2 ( try setting gamma=1 for a stationary particle ) so we can write momentum = energy * velocity / c^2or momentum = energy/c for particles moving at the speed of light.So , even though a photon has zero ( or very small ) mass , it still has momentum , which it can transfer to an electron .",0

"Terrorist , rebel or freedom fighter ? What ’ s the difference between a terrorist , rebel or a freedom fighter ? At one point in history a number of American ’ s were considered terrorists by the loyal New York residents which had stronger ties to the British . As time went by and support weakened , they became rebels , fighting for US freedom.Is terrorism relative to ones location and beliefs ? I think the answer is in the targets . 'Legitimate ' Rebels/Freedom fighters will use tactical and strategic attacks against a government to gain leverage for their beliefs , or to cause attrition of the enemies resources to force them to the negotiating table , the way the revolutionaries did . Guerilla warfare is neccessary when facing superior numbers , but cowardly attacks on civilians is what makes a terrorist . The public at large ends up being the target . In these attacks the purpose seems to be to attract outside attention , and to try and de-stabilize a government by attacking public support for it 's policies . A government in power will always try and attach the most negative connotation to it 's enemies , so in British eyes they were terrorists but if you analyze the methodology of their warfare they were not . Collateral damage occurs in all warfare . Warriors minimize it , terrorists strive for it.Civilian targets : Terrorist.Government , military , infrastructure targets : Lawful warfare.If anyone were to organize resistance to an unjust government , even when that resistance is justified and even encouraged by laws of the land , that resistance would have to focus on legitimate targets rather than the population at large to be considered freedom fighters instead of terrorists .",0

"How much money has Haliburton and its alliliates made from government contracts since 9/11 ? Who came second ? I 'm not sure of the exact figure but here are some figures that might help clarify the situation : Halliburton has received $ 7.8 billion in U.S. taxpayer assistance since 1992 ( excluding money from the Pentagon ) . Please bear in mind that this money has nothing to do with actual government ( mostly military ) contracts and thus constitutes a corporate `` handout '' for a multi-billion dollar conglomerate . The value of Halliburton 's government contracts increased by nearly 100 percent , from $ 1.2 billion to $ 2.3 billion , during Dick Cheney 's tenure as CEO . Since becoming vice president , Cheney has NOT divested himself of his Halliburton stock and has in fact continued to increase the company 's ( and his own ) profits . ( Note : An internal Pentagon email proves that a $ 7 billion no-bid contract awarded to Halliburton on March 8 , 2003 was `` coordinated '' with Cheney 's office . ) It is a safe bet that we are talking tens of billions ( with a B ) of dollars in Halliburton 's coffers since 9/11 , much of that money courtesy of Cheney and all of it courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer .

"Why does like charges repel each other ? This is a very good question . Ultimately it comes down to being one of the fundamental features of our universe . But it can also be broken down a bit.Like charges repel , and opposite ones attract because of differences in their electric fields . But the electric fields are really part of the larger electromagnetic force . This force is mediated by photons ( light ) and , indeed light is a self-propagating electromagnetic wave.But there are also three other fundamental forces : gravity , the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force . The strong nuclear force is well , strong , but very short range . It holds the protons and neutrons together in a nucleus ( otherwise the like charges from the protons would break up every nucleus except hydrogen ) . The weak nuclear force is sort of a miscellaneous , and comes into play in certain radioactive decay sequences.In the 1980s it was shown that the electromagnetic and weak forces are actually the same thing . The difference we observe is that the universe is , relatively speaking , `` cold , '' and these two parts have separated out . It is sort of like having a glass of steam ( one thing ) which cools down until there is water and ice ( two things ) . The water and ice look a lot different from each other , but are fundamentally the same . In the same way in the very , very early universe when things were a lot hotter , the electromagnetic and weak forces were identical - like the steam in the analogy.More recently it was found that the strong force can also be linked to the `` electroweak '' force in the same sort of manner . The mathematical and physical details are different from `` electroweak unification '' but the basic principle is the same . It was from this Grand Unification of the electromagnetic , weak , and strong forces the the theoretical notion of quarks came . This GUT has been tested and the experiments show it is right on target.The next step is to connect the electro-weak-strong force with gravity . This is a lot harder because the first three are understood in the context of Quantum Mechanics and gravity is understood with General Relativity . QM and GR are not compatible on some basic principles.One approach that is being tried to combine QM and GR is with string theory . To make this work the universe is composed of 11 dimensions , the usual 3-spatial and 1-temporal dimentsion , plus 7 very , very small spatial dimensions . If these extra 7 are looped around themselves so that they are vastly `` smaller '' than a proton , we 'd never really notice them.What string theory seems to suggest is that there are just some ways to make stuff in the universe , and one of these ways is to create the `` force particles '' that mediate the fundamental forces.So , extrapolating that , and realizing that string theory is in no sense proven , we can say that `` like charges repel '' because of the geometry ( the 11-dimensions ) of the universe.But string theory remains far from being complete mathematically , and no one can really make solid predictions yet to test it . So , you can also fall back on the answer in the first paragraph .",0
"Does it spoil your enjoyment of a sports event if you already know the winner before you see a delayed tape . ? The most recent example is the Olympics . The news knows the winners , but the events wo n't be shown till later . This question is for any and all sports . I 'm a boxing fan , and the pay-per-view events are usually replayed the next week for all those who did n't buy the event . Of course I still enjoy it , but it 's completely different . I 've usually read reviews of what happened and pay attention more closely because I 'm interested in seeing how close to the truth those reviews were . Sometimes the reviews overrate the fights , though , and I end up more disappointed than I would be had I not read the reviews.But , as for knowing who the winner is , it only makes a difference if I have a particular favorite in that event . If my favorite lost , I 'll watch more intensely than ever to know how it happened . If he won , I can just sit back and relax watching the show . If you were asking whether or not I 'd want to know who won before watching the fight , I 'd have to say definitely yes , but I can still be in complete suspense just waiting to see how it happened .",0

When the temperature outside ( that will affect the inside body temperature ) is changed , it changed the whole things that happened in our body , such as hormones , blood pressure , and especially , the lifosit ( the body 's defense `` army '' ) . Sure , if the lifosit ca n't work well , so does the entire body 's defense system . But why microbes still can live at its best ? Simple , because the microbes ' temperature tolerance is higher ( or `` cooler '' ) than our body.So in short , when our body is in cold , it 's just like a snow hurricane winter to our body 's defense system , but still a summer springtime for the microbes . When the microbes spread over the body , it then attacks the part of the body that it loves , such as the brain ( so that it makes you dizzy ) , the defense system ( and the body reacted with rising your body temperature to reactivate the lifosit ) , and the sponge organ within our neck ( that 's their fave place ) . That 's the reason why if you get cold , wearing a syal or drinking hot tea makes better .",0

"what is the best way to get money for college ? The first thing you need to know about money for college is that there are two kinds . Free and not free . In other words there are loans and scholarships . You want scholarships first and whatever is n't paid for by those can be covered with loans . To get scholarships some people think you have to be a `` straight A '' student or an exceptional athlete . Although those things do help , they are n't always necessary . You may have certain unique talents and abilities that can earn you scholarships regardless of your grades . Try visiting www.fastweb.com . You can use this site to make a profile and they will e-mail you scholarship opportunities that apply specifically to you ! Two kids from my high school won a scholarship for making their prom outfits out of duct tape ! True story ! Not all of the scholarships are that crazy but again , they do n't necessarily relate to grades or sports . If you do have good grades and/or play sports ; great ! Use that in your profile and they will send you opportunities that apply directly to your talents . It is totally free and there is no limit as to how many scholarships you can apply for and even win . So try to pay for everything you can with scholarships and then you may need to fill in some gaps with loans . Your next stop : www.fasfa.com . There you will apply for financial aid . You will need your most recent W-2 and your parents help when you apply . If you do n't have parents or you are over 24 years of age you get to skip the parent section . This site may reward you with some scholarships as well but it 's usually mostly government loans . That is why I would suggest applying for dozens of scholarships first . Good luck finding the money and good luck once you start school . Remember ; for every hour spent in class you should spend two hours studying !",0

"Why does society feel that they have the right to impose their opinion on others ? When an issue is one where there will be no viable consequence to society but is of a completly personal nature . ie abortion , religion , etc ... Why do people feel they have the right to force others to live the way they 've chosen instead of leaving these issues up to the person who will be affected by their choice . Abortion and religious decisions should absolutely be made only by yourself only . You are absolutely right how people try to impose their beliefs onto others . For example , most people believe that everyone should believe in god and go to church , but if there is someone who does n't feel this way , you think since most people feel the other way that it is wrong . You know what , i am an aetheist , and if someone thinks i 'm an idiot because of this , Screw you ! ! ! I do n't care what society as a whole really thinks . It 's just like trying to fit in when your in highschool , all of the cool kids where the cool clothes , if you do n't your the freak , and i would just like to yell at everyone who has ever done this to someone .

"If you wanted to come out about an work relationship , how would you do it ? Would you tell everyone in the store were you worked at or just start with a few nice people ? I do n't think I would make an official announcement . I think it 's best , in a workplace , to just continue to act professionally , as you have been , and if someone asks if you 're seeing anyone , then you can say , `` Actually , yes , I 've been seeing Roger for six months ! '' Or , if someone says , `` Hey , is there something going on between you and Roger ? '' say `` we 've been dating for six months , actually . '' Then you wo n't need to spread the news -- trust me , it will spread itself.After you tell someone , the best thing to do might be to follow up with a `` We 're very happy , but it 's important to both of us that we act professionally in the workplace ! We want to make sure everyone 's still comfortable . '' And then continue to act that way.The reason I say not to make an official announcement is that that is the most surefire way to get everyone gossipping ( even if you do n't think they will ! ) , and looking out for drama . Rather , if you just reveal quietly when asked , it 'll seem like `` no big deal , '' or , people will realize that you 've been acting so professionally , that 's why they 're surprised ! They will be less likely to gossip that way . ( Of course , if it 's your boss or your direct report , or if it 's against company policy , I would advise you seek a different job . )",0

How can you even take a scientific approach to this ?

"who killed fernand magellan ? Death of MagellanHeading northwest , the crew reached the equator on 13 February 1521 . On 6 March , they reached the Marianas and on 16 March , the island of Homonhon in the Philippines , with 150 crewmen left . Magellan was able to communicate with the native peoples because his Malay interpreter could understand their language . They traded gifts with Rajah Kolambu of Limasawa , who guided them to Cebu , on April 7 . Rajah Humabon of Cebu was friendly to them , and even agreed to accept Christianity.The initial peace with the Philippine natives proved misleading . Magellan was killed in the Battle of Mactan , against indigenous forces led by Lapu-Lapu , on April 27 , 1521 . Antonio Pigafetta , a wealthy tourist who paid to be on the Magellan voyage , provided the only extant eyewitness account of the events culminating in Magellan 's death , as follows : Monument in Lapu-Lapu City that marks the site where Magellan was purportedly killed '' When morning came , forty-nine of us leaped into the water up to our thighs , and walked through water for more than two cross-bow flights before we could reach the shore . The boats could not approach nearer because of certain rocks in the water . The other eleven men remained behind to guard the boats . When we reached land , [ the natives ] had formed in three divisions to the number of more than one thousand five hundred persons . When they saw us , they charged down upon us with exceeding loud cries ... The musketeers and crossbow-men shot from a distance for about a half-hour , but uselessly ... Recognizing the captain , so many turned upon him that they knocked his helmet off his head twice ... An Indian hurled a bamboo spear into the captain 's face , but the latter immediately killed him with his lance , which he left in the Indian 's body . Then , trying to lay hand on sword , he could draw it out but halfway , because he had been wounded in the arm with a bamboo spear . When the natives saw that , they all hurled themselves upon him . One of them wounded him on the left leg with a large cutlass , which resembles a scimitar , only being larger . That caused the captain to fall face downward , when immediately they rushed upon him with iron and bamboo spears and with their cutlasses , until they killed our mirror , our light , our comfort , and our true guide . When they wounded him , he turned back many times to see whether we were all in the boats . Thereupon , beholding him dead , we , wounded , retreated , as best we could , to the boats , which were already pulling off .

"pls send me the english lyrics of the poem `` mi ultimo adios '' by Philippine hero Jose Rizal.. pls ... ? ? ? The Last Farewell ( English version of Mi Ultimo Adios ) by Jose RizalFarewell , my adored Land , region of the sun caressed , Pearl of the Orient Sea , our Eden lost , With gladness I give you my Life , sad and repressed ; And were it more brilliant , more fresh and at its best , I would still give it to you for your welfare at most.On the fields of battle , in the fury of fight , Others give you their lives without pain or hesitancy , The place does not matter : cypress laurel , lily white , Scaffold , open field , conflict or martyrdom 's site , It is the same if asked by home and Country.I die as I see tints on the sky b'gin to showAnd at last announce the day , after a gloomy night ; If you need a hue to dye your matutinal glow , Pour my blood and at the right moment spread it so , And gild it with a reflection of your nascent light ! My dreams , when scarcely a lad adolescent , My dreams when already a youth , full of vigor to attain , Were to see you , gem of the sea of the Orient , Your dark eyes dry , smooth brow held to a high planeWithout frown , without wrinkles and of shame without stain.My life 's fancy , my ardent , passionate desire , Hail ! Cries out the soul to you , that will soon part from thee ; Hail ! How sweet 't is to fall that fullness you may acquire ; To die to give you life , 'neath your skies to expire , And in your mystic land to sleep through eternity ! If over my tomb some day , you would see blow , A simple humble flow'r amidst thick grasses , Bring it up to your lips and kiss my soul so , And under the cold tomb , I may feel on my brow , Warmth of your breath , a whiff of your tenderness.Let the moon with soft , gentle light me descry , Let the dawn send forth its fleeting , brilliant light , In murmurs grave allow the wind to sigh , And should a bird descend on my cross and alight , Let the bird intone a song of peace o'er my site.Let the burning sun the raindrops vaporizeAnd with my clamor behind return pure to the sky ; Let a friend shed tears over my early demise ; And on quiet afternoons when one prays for me on high , Pray too , oh , my Motherland , that in God may rest I.Pray thee for all the hapless who have died , For all those who unequalled torments have undergone ; For our poor mothers who in bitterness have cried ; For orphans , widows and captives to tortures were shied , And pray too that you may see your own redemption.And when the dark night wraps the cemet'ryAnd only the dead to vigil there are left alone , Do n't disturb their repose , do n't disturb the mystery : If you hear the sounds of cittern or psaltery , It is I , dear Country , who , a song t'you intone.And when my grave by all is no more remembered , With neither cross nor stone to mark its place , Let it be plowed by man , with spade let it be scatteredAnd my ashes ere to nothingness are restored , Let them turn to dust to cover your earthly space.Then it does n't matter that you should forget me : Your atmosphere , your skies , your vales I 'll sweep ; Vibrant and clear note to your ears I shall be : Aroma , light , hues , murmur , song , moanings deep , Constantly repeating the essence of the faith I keep.My idolized Country , for whom I most gravely pine , Dear Philippines , to my last goodbye , oh , harkenThere I leave all : my parents , loves of mine , I 'll go where there are no slaves , tyrants or hangmenWhere faith does not kill and where God alone does reign.Farewell , parents , brothers , beloved by me , Friends of my childhood , in the home distressed ; Give thanks that now I rest from the wearisome day ; Farewell , sweet stranger , my friend , who brightened my way ; Farewell , to all I love . To die is to rest .",0

"Is sending money better than going to a wedding even if a parent ? Is sending a money gift to a child 's wedding better than burdening the wedding party with extra stresses like being requested to support the story of a parent who has become involved in serious personal marital difficulties ? Can life-threatening problems be set aside without hypocrisy taking over the wedding events ? If the parent ought to attend the wedding , then is acting as if everything is alright with the also invited problematic partner the only route ? While personal agendas are obviously impolite , the hope of gaining family backing even at a wedding of a child can not be set aside completely . Or must that be done ? Whatever your personal problems are at the moment , I promise you that forcing the wedding party to answer questions about your absence will be way more stressful . You say `` hypocrisy '' would take over , but I do n't think it is at all hypocritical to set aside personal matters for the day and focus on the couple 's happiness.Get over yourself and go to that wedding !",0

If not then every time i have a glassof wine im breaking the law ? ? ? Also i thought that you can drink like beer with your parents permision on your on land as long as your dont leave and you dont give your friends any ? ? well i was just curious . the last two have it right . All the states set the drinking age but in any state anyone drinking under the legal drinking age is in violation no matter where they are . Also your parents are technically contributing to the delinquency of a minor which is also a crime . However , I think this is one of the least enforced laws nationwide until parties and stuff get involved . A drink with your parents at dinner wont get looked at twice",0

"Do they really have govt . grants anyone can get ? It is hard to find grants to start a business . Unlike the myths that some perpetuate , federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business . And yes , grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it , that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.Nonetheless , you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance ( CFDA ) http : //www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http : //www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants . Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.Even if you buy books on `` how to get grants '' or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has , albeit packaged differently . But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.Even SBA does NOT give out grants . From the SBA website http : //www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html '' The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses , although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs . ( See http : //www.sba.gov/financing for more information ) While SBA does offer some grant programs , these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management , technical , or financial assistance . These grants generally support non-profit organizations , intermediary lending institutions , and state and local governments . `` Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements ( e.g . minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant # 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities ( grant 59.043 Women 's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women 's business center that will train women entrepreneurs For private grants , you may want to check the Foundation Center 's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online . It 's a subscription based website ( $ 9.95 per month ) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for `` students , artists , academic researchers , libraries and financial aid offices . '' Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them , so I take it they also do n't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.http : //www.cfda.govhttp : //www.grants.govhttp : //gtionline.fdncenter.orghttp : //www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htmhttp : //www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html",0
"What is Rational Unified Process ( RUP ) ? how does it relate to project management ? RUP is a standardized software development process . It had its origins in the unified modeling language . Rational Corp. took the UML and developed a standardized process for implementing projects in a series of iterations based on its UML tools . IBM bought Rational and continued RUP development . IBM recently donated part of its RUP intellectual property to the open source community . See link in sources for more info.The second part of your question is a little harder . How RUP relates to project managment is that RUP is a process . It defines the steps to be taken to produce a product and it defines the deliverables to be produced at each phase . So , the relationship between RUP and project management is RUP defines the artifacts to be produced and PM strives to manage the cost and schedule associated with producing those artifacts .",0

"how many merders happen in new york each year ? 270 during last year.Murders were up slightly nationwide during the first six months of the year , and gang violence contributed to more killings in some of the nation 's largest cities , the FBI reported Monday . The number of murders rose 1.1 % nationwide , while overall violent crime declined 3.1 % . New York , Baltimore and Philadelphia were among the cities with an increase in homicides.The reasons for the increase in homicides vary by city . But experts said there has been a resurgence in gang activity in some of the cities . `` The question is , what are they fighting over ? '' said Kenneth Land , a Duke University sociology professor . `` Is it retribution homicides , or turf wars over drugs , or is it protecting turf ? `` The FBI 's six-month status report , based on reports from state and local law enforcement agencies , is widely viewed as an important indicator of national crime trends each year . The report also is considered a good predictor for the bureau 's year-end crime analysis.The report does not include raw totals for categories of crimes , only percentages . However , the FBI had figures for some large cities.The six-month totals for 2003 marked the third consecutive time the FBI has recorded a decrease in overall violent crimes but an increase in murders.The FBI said there were 308 murders from January to June of this year in New York City , compared with 270 during the same span last year . Philadelphia had 158 murders in the first half of this year — 20 more than in the first half of 2002 . Baltimore had 141 ( 14 more ) and Newark , N.J. , had 40 ( 13 more ) .Officials in Washington declared a crime emergency this summer during a spate of mostly gang-related violence.Overall , there were 4.3 % more murders in the Northeast part of the country during the first half of 2003 compared with last year . There also were slightly more homicides in the South and West ; only the Midwest showed a decrease ( -1.9 % ) .Many major cities outside the Northeast had fewer slayings , the report said . Los Angeles was down by 65 ; it had 258 . Detroit had 156 ( 28 fewer ) and Las Vegas dropped by six , from 70 to 64.Even with the national increase in murder , overall violent crime fell , as it has for most of the past decade . Other violent crimes besides murder that are measured are forcible rape , robbery and aggravated assault.Aggravated assaults were down 4.4 % . Forcible rapes dropped 4 % and robberies less than 1 % . Property crimes dropped by 0.8 % compared with the year before , although motor vehicle thefts were up slightly at 0.9 % . Other property crimes are burglary and larceny.The number of arsons — measured separately — dropped 10 % . Every part of the country saw fewer criminal fires set in the first half of 2003.The nation 's largest cities , those with more than 250,000 residents , saw violent crime drop slightly more than 4 % . The drop was most pronounced in rural areas , however , where violent crime fell 5.7 % . Violent crime was down 1.1 % in the suburbs.The rates for property crime changed very little in cities and suburbs in the first half of 2003 , but rural counties experienced a 2.5 % decrease.All regions of the country showed a decrease in motor vehicle thefts from January to June except the West , where they rose by 7.2 % .The FBI 's Uniform Crime Reports for the first six months of the year are based on information collected from 9,908 state and local law enforcement agencies .",0
"How did the advancing technology of weapons affect WWI ? The primary advances were the airplane , submarine , machine gun , tank , and posionous gas . The machine gun made the frontal assault very costly thus trenches were used to protect the soldiers . These trenches were also lived in , which produced rat infestation , constantly wet conditions , and poor sanitation . All of these will contribute to the spread of disease and trench foot which sometimes resulted in amputation and even death . To attack the machine guns the tank was developed and although early models were notoriously unreliable their use in the final months contributed to the Allied victory . Poison gas will kill , cripple , and blind thousands . Airplanes initially used only for scouting will later develop into fighters against other planes and bombers . This will lead to some of the best known participants of the war and the glory of being a pilot ( Red Baron , Rickenbaker ) . Finally the submarine will spread the war to innocents on passenger ships and slow commerce to England and from the United States . More importantly it was the German use of Unrestricted submarine Warfare ( along with the Zimmerman note ) that brought the US into the war . It was the infusion of large numbers of Americans with their aggressive fighting ability that will be the deciding factor in the Allied victory .",0

I was in a class at my company 's HQ in Baltimore . During our 10 AM coffee break one of the guys came in and said that a plane had hit the World Trade Center ... we thought he meant the WTC in downtown Baltimore ... we all went outside to look ... nothing wrong there . We all went next door to see the TV and realized it was in NYC ... by then the 2nd tower had been hit . Class was out for the day ... we were all glued to the TV ... everyone in the company was sent home early because Gov . Glendening was going to close the I-95 tunnel under Balto . Harbor.By the mid-afternoon there were F-16s flying combat air patrol over Baltimore.Our class got out that Friday ; all of us had to drive home - no flights available ; another guy and I had a rental car from the week before . I live in Oregon ; he lives in Arizona . We started driving - dropped him off with his brother-in-law in Detroit , then I drove all the way to Portland . One guy had to rent a U-Haul to drive home ; rental cars could n't be had for love or money.One of my cousins is a lawyer in NYC ... we like her in spite of it : ) ... she had an early morning meeting in the WTC , and got out of the north tower 1/2 hr . before the first plane hit ...",0

"A possible cause of terrorism ? I 've watched several muslim men with their young sons . Every one of them allowed their sons to do anything they wanted . There was no guidance whatsoever . When the mother would try to check the son 's activities , to tell him no , the child ignored her , because he knew that the father would not back her up . Are the three fathers I 've noticed indicative of the greater percentage of mulim parenting ? If so , could the fact that they are never told they are wrong , that they are spoiled into getting what they want , be a cause for the childish tantrums thrown by adults who kill because they have never been made to grow up ? First off terrorism is not limited to Muslims and all Muslims are not terrorist . The Irish Republican Army = terrorist , school yard bullies = terrorist , Gangs & Mafias = terrorist . Now that that misconception is clear . Let 's talk terrorism . I do n't think what you have mentioned is a possible cause of terrorism because I witness the same thing happen right here in the US anytime I go to the store .

"Will unfounded domestic violence charge hold up in court in Va ? My husband and I were arguing in our apartment and the neighbors called the police . We were alreay in the process of `` making up '' . The police came and interviewed him and visualy saw marks on me from the `` making up '' . The police arrested him for domestic violence and said that the state of Virginia would charge him for it not the city . They never took a statement from me nor pictures . From the time my husband got arrested to his release back to me took 45 min . He litterly walked in the back door did some paperwork and walked out the front.What are the odds that he will be found guilty with only the testamony of the officer and me testifying and telling my story in defense of my husband in the state of Va. You know , I suspect you 're not going to get many takers on this one . You 've got a lot of issues here that are very involved and nobody who knows what they are talking about is going to be able to give you an answer based on the `` facts '' you 've presented here.Rather than try to answer your question , let me ask you some more : What do you define as arguing ? Was it strictly verbal or was there any physical touching whatsoever ? Were any threats of any kind made during the argument ? You said the police saw marks on you from `` making up '' ... which , frankly , is very suspicious to an old cop like me . But the question is , what kind of marks ? Are you talking about a hickey or a bruise ? When the police interviewed your husband , what did he say ? Did he perhaps admit to doing something that would have violated the law in your state ? And please - if you did not personally hear the interview between your husband and the police , you do not *know* what was said ... you might know what your husband told you later , but if you did n't hear it for yourself , you do n't know.Do n't know if you 're asking a question about the city or the state prosecuting , but if you are : not unusual for the state to prosecute a domestic violence charge , even if the victim denies it or changes their story later.If you told the police the marks on you were from `` making up '' , then they did take a statement from you . Once you said that , the police may have felt that was all the statement they were going to get out of you - especially if the marks they saw were not consistent with what you said was `` making up '' ( for example : most people do n't make up by leaving bruises , swollen lips , scratches , black eyes , etc ... if those are the marks you 're talking about , I 'm with the cops on this one ) .If you had marks , the police certainly should have taken photos of them . Some types of minor injuries do n't show well in photos ( especially depending on the equipment ) so they may not have thought photos were worthwhile or they just simply did n't take them . What were your `` marks '' ? You 're asking what the odds are that he 'll be found guilty based on what you say is the officer 's testimony and your statement in defense of your husband . Ca n't answer that one because neither you nor I have all the facts , I suspect.What did the neighbors say ( or more importantly , do the neighbors have something to say ; did they hear threats , did they hear physical violence , did they hear you say something that would suggest you were being victimized ) ? What did he say ? Maybe without meaning to , he admitted to a crime . He would n't be the first person to do so ... and if the cops were skillful interviewers , they may have obtained an admission or confession from him without him realizing he was doing so.What is the crime of domestic violence in Virginia ? You were smart to include that you 're in that state because it certainly makes a difference ( and unfortunately , I 'm not from there ) .Do the police know you and your husband ? Either of you been arrested for domestic violence before ? Bottom line : way too many `` what-if 's '' for anyone to give you an educated answer to your question . Depending on the answers to the questions I 've asked , the chances of him being found guilty could be very good , or very poor.And finally : I 've investigated domestic violence crimes for over 18 years as a police officer . I hope everything you wrote here is absolutely true ... that you were not the victim of domestic violence , and that you are as safe today as the day you were born . I hope nobody ever lays a hand on you , threatens you , or abuses you . However , what you 've written here ( and what I suspect your answers to some of my questions might be ) is some of the most commonly-expressed statements I 've heard from domestic violence vi",0

"Global warming ? Should we take steps to prevent global warming or should we just ride it out ? Several things : First , the data is flawed . Most temperature measurements are taken in cities where you have an increase of what is called a heat island that is growing . More asphalt and concret to store heat . Second the temp and CO2 levels are rising but so what . The CO2 levels have been 10 times higher than they currently are and the planet has been much hotter in the past and its done well enough for us to still be here . And all of that is without the help of humans.Third we are comming out of an ice age . Ice age=cold , no ice age=hot . Fourth the suns output of energy has risen in the past century , more energy into our system = more heat.Reasons why more CO2 is not a bad thing . Plants use CO2 for photosynthesis , more CO2 = more photosynthesis = more plants . The earth is in a greenification process right now that is turning alot of grasslands into areas that have shrubs and areas with shrubs are growing trees . Final thing , WE MUST CUT DOWN ON TOXIC POLLUTANTS . toxic waste , CFC 's and other horrible pollutants are destroying nature and that is 100 % our fault and quite preventable .",0
"what do you think about eurotrip ? I think Eurotrip is a great comedy and I take it like that - not to seriously . The fact is that it 's a lot misleading . Even though they travelled through the whole Europe , almost the entire movie has been shot in Prague , Czech Republic . But the worst thing was the part where they visited Slovak Republic and Bratislava . I come from Slovakia and the whole image of the country in Eurotrip was very insulting . It looked like the country is still in middle ages . And the fact that they lived in luxury and comfort for one or two dollars is a total bullshit . Bratislava is one of the most expensive cities in Central Europe and in the entire EU . For two dollars you would not even get a coffee in the downtown . And that kind of hotel they staid in would cost about $ 100 dollars per one night or more . My point is that when someone presents our country in such way it really hurts us since it 's miles from the truth . People should know what they are putting inside of the movie and be very careful with that since they are risking the whole public opinion on the country .

"why was u.s.s.r.'seconomy having proplems under communism ? I lived in Moscow in 1992 for five months ... one of the vestiges of the communist system was the local food-staple ( milk , sugar , eggs and four ) market . Part of the system was to create jobs for all-To buy anything from this market you had to stand in an hour-long line to get a ticket that represented an item like a bag of flour , then you had to stand in an hour-long line to pay for what the tickets represented , then you had to go into another hour-long line to pick up the items you paid for , and finally you had to wait in an hour-long line for them to check your purchases against the reciepts and tickets . Four hours to buy milk and eggs- assuming you know exactly what you want.In a word , the economy was suffering from gross `` inefficiency '' that made profitability impossible . The inefficiencies came from govt . corruption and the notion that everyone should have a job ( even if the work is meaningless like it was in the market ) . Because it almost always cost more to produce than the benefit of production , the govt . borrowed heavily to support it 's programs ( which included almost all business because the govt . `` nationalized '' meaning they owned almost all of them ) leading to massive inflation and the eventual implosion of its economy .",0

"Why do so many women like bad boy types ? The debate of `` nice guys vs. bad boys '' has been raging for quite a long time . The nature of being a `` nice guy '' , however , is commonly misunderstood . It is believed that being polite , considerate , friendly , tender , romantic , etc . is what being a `` nice guy '' is all about and thus those qualities should be avoided , as it is the `` bad boy '' , the rude , the inconsiderate , the impolite , the rough guy who always gets the girl while the `` nice guy '' is waiting outside in the pouring rain with flowers in his hand.It does n't mean that women prefer rude over polite , inconsiderate over considerate , etc . It all becomes clear when we look at a very important issue often overlooked when trying to define what makes the `` bad boys '' beat the `` nice guys '' when it comes to getting the girls . It is sexuality - the `` bad boys '' are not afraid to show that they are sexual beings , while the `` nice guys '' hide their sexuality as a part of their agenda of being friendly , polite , and courteous towards women .",0

"Where did the term `` I 'll be there with bells on '' originate ? I seem to remember reading somewhere that in the old sled/carriage days that if a fellow teamster had to bail you out of trouble , you traditionally gave them your sleighbells as a thank you ( or mark of shame ? ) . Ca n't find that reference any more . Direct quote from http : //www.rootsweb.com/~genepool/meanings.htm : `` To be somewhere with `` bells on '' refers to a practice peddlers had when they roamed the area west of the Appalachians selling wares . To avoid Indians , they traveled as silently as possible until they reached a settled area . Then they unmuffled bells hung around their horses necks to announce their arrival to outlying cabins . Hence , `` I 'll be there with bells on . '' The peddlers ' arrival was a much anticipated major event in the mostly tedious and hard lives of settlers , not only for the goods they sold , but also for the news , letters , and messages they carried from the outside world .

"The Practice of Tithing : for today ? Is the practice of Tithing as described in the Old Testament Laws , and Malachi still to be practiced by Gentile Christians and/or Israeli Christians today , or has the new covenant practice of Giving cheerfully out of ones abundance and ability , as mentioned in II Corinthians replaced the old way ? Can a church today survive without a legalistic tenth of the congregations income , relying only on the abundant non percentage giving of those who are willing and able ? You are correct , it is unbiblical for a preacher to require members to tithe of income . Also tithing was always food never money and the tithe was always eaten by the tither . Read Deut . 12 and 14 . Can a church survive ? Yes but not as a mega church . the churches would be smaller and be more quality than quantity ( Jesus himself only had twelve apostles ) . Eliminate tithing and the pastor is forced to live by faith , not many of them want to do that though.Our church does not believe in tithing of income nor do I take an offering ( some do give anyway ) . When God decides it is time to close up then we will close up . All churches should run on faith not business tactics . The only thing most pastors have faith in is their ability to con their members out of more money.And in Malachi when it mentions will a man rob God ( preachers love that one ) no one mentions that this is written to the Levitical priests Mal 2:1 . It was the priests stealing the tithe from the tithers . It must be an honest mistake that they forgot this . lol . Malachi 3:8 ties in with I Samuel 2:12-17 . There were corrupt priests stealing then and there are corrupt preachers stealing now . I can hear the lake of fire calling for them now .

Why GOD is called HE ? read Concept of God has emerged in the mankind after being born and based on the behaviour pattern of human beings alone.Religions have unable to convey the essence and existance of GOD which could unite every human being without doubts.Religions have created more doubts . However many followers , which kept dividing in numbers , according to technical interpretations , and , became politicl force.Reality of the ABSOLUTE got lost.Earth lost importance , motherhood too lost significance.What is reality ? A spermis a phenomena but is part of of a phenomena called Ovum.Mensurations periods of a woman are like monsoon periods on Earth which prepares itself for creating life all arround .Woman sheds her blood and earth the essence of blood , water.In stead of calling let us save this Earth , let Us say O ! mother Earth accept us with LOVE in YOUR WOMB .The GOD inside this phenomena will listen to your prayers .God is experienced in every mode of nature and not outside it as propagated by religion God is commonly referred to in the masculine sense because of the relationship that primarily judaism based religions wished to portray between god and mankind . God the Father , because at the time all the ancient religious texts for these religions were written a family was dominated by the father and rather than using the metaphor of the mother , which would imply at the time that there was some other superior to the God figure , they used a masculine term . This term has persisted due to a continuation of male dominance in society and through the institution of tradition which is now so ancient that many believe it would be heresy to alter it today . It is true that the relationship that many today share with god is much better described as female , but this too stems from the feminization of 'soft ' concepts such as love and procreation . Consequently calling God male or female is 100 % related to culture and I would like to answer your question with a question . Why try to personify god as male or female ? If you follow western society 's modern beleif that male and female are equal , or the more radical belief that there is no definite male or female but shades of gender ( see transgender ) , and if gender serves the sole function of procreation through sexual intercourse why attempt to place the all powerful being that is God within the restraints of a single gender . God does not need to procreate through sexuality as God is capable of creation without thought or effort . So , why call God she ? Why not just understand that God is God regardless of name or gender .",0
"whats the verdict ? If I have tablet w/ voice output and I wrote something falsely accusing a person behind a sheet of cloth , the person heard my false accusation via voice generation . How would he/she sue me , slander or libel ? What Are Defamation , Libel and Slander ? Generally speaking , defamation is the issuance of a false statement about another person , which causes that person to suffer harm . Slander involves the making of defamatory statements by a transitory ( non-fixed ) representation , usually an oral ( spoken ) representation . Libel involves the making of defamatory statements in a printed or fixed medium , such as a magazine or newspaper . Typically , the elements of a cause of action for defamation include : A false and defamatory statement concerning another ; The unprivileged publication of the statement to a third party ( that is , somebody other than the person defamed by the statement ) ; If the defamatory matter is of public concern , fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher ; and Damage to the plaintiff . In the context of defamation law , a statement is `` published '' when it is made to the third party . That term does not mean that the statement has to be in print . Damages are typically to the reputation of the plaintiff , but depending upon the laws of the jurisdiction it may be enough to establish mental anguish . Most jurisdictions also recognize `` per se '' defamation , where the allegations are presumed to cause damage to the plaintiff . Typically , the following may consititute defamation per se : Attacks on a person 's professional character or standing ; Allegations that an unmarried person is unchaste ; Allegations that a person is infected with a sexually transmitted disease ; Allegations that the person has committed a crime of moral turpitude ; While actions for defamation have their roots in common law , most jurisdictions have now enacted statutes which modify the common law . They may change the elements of the cause of action , limit when an action may be filed , or modify the defenses to an action for defamation . Some may even require that the defendant be given an opportunity to apologize before the plaintiff can seek non-economic damages .",0

I actually have access to many large computer vendors and neweggs price is still sometimes $ 20 cheaper or more for basic hardware . I would assume a manufacturer or wholesaler .

"american culture values ? Interesting question . If you refer to an identity for american culture , my guess is that identity comes from multiculturalism , the meeting point of various cultures and cultural values and cultural viewpoints . America ( both as a continent and as the US of A ) is home to so many nationalities that one might get lost in trying to find what American culture is about or what being an american really is.So my opinion is that multi ( or pluriculturalism , not sure which is best used ) is the identifier here . At least it should be , because an environment which harbors such diversity should promote understanding , empathy and coexistance for those cultures which are part of it , something that the USA declares itself to be upholding , but its internal and external policies seem to disagree .",0

When you have installed and uninstalled a lot of programs those programs sometimes leaving entries in the registry behind .

I would n't pay for it though . CCleaner features a registry cleaner and it is completely free so I would just get that instead . CCleaner also includes a number of other utilities as well .,0

"What is a worm , trojan ? and how is it different from a computer virus ? Trojan horse is a malicious program that is disguised as legitimate software.A Trojan horse program has a useful and desired function , or at least it has the appearance of having such . In most cases the program performs other , undesired functions , but not always . The useful , or seemingly useful , functions serve as camouflage for these undesired functions . The kind of undesired functions are not part of the definition of a Trojan Horse ; they can be of any kind.In practice , Trojan Horses in the wild often contain spying functions ( such as a packet sniffer ) or backdoor functions that allow a computer , unbeknownst to the owner , to be remotely controlled from the network , creating a `` zombie computer '' . Because Trojan horses often have these harmful functions , there often arises the misunderstanding that such functions define a Trojan Horse.The basic difference from computer viruses is : a Trojan horse is technically a normal computer program and does not possess the means to spread itself . Originally Trojan horses were not designed to spread themselves . They relied on fooling people to allow the program to perform actions that they would otherwise not have voluntarily performed . Trojans of recent times also contain functions and strategies that enable their spreading . This moves them closer to the definition of computer viruses , and it becomes difficult to clearly distinguish such mixed programs between Trojan horses and viruses .",0

"I cant pay for college how do i make more $ with only high school ? You are n't going to be making a lot of money with just a high school degree unless you have some new invention or idea that will revolutionize the world.There are a lot of grants and scholarships out there that will pay for your college as long as you do well while you are in college so that they continue to give you funding.Actually the poorer you are the more free money you will get . If you have done well in high school the easier it is to get funding . You can also get scholarships from all over the place . There are a lot of places to look on the internet for scholarships and the college you pick can also assist you in finding scholarships.At the very least there are student loans that will pay for your college and you have to pay those back when you have completed college , but it is well worth going to college than not going .",0

"WAt would reduce the resistance of a metal wire ? Increasing its thickness , temperature , or length ? ? Or would it be all of those 3 ? increasing thickness , decreasing temperature , and decreasing length would all reduce the resistance of a metal wire . so the only thing that reduces it by increasing is thickness.a good way to remember this is just to reason it out . if the wire is thicker , current can move more freely and with less resistance then a thinner , more constricted wire . the electrons in the current would have more space to move around . if you increase temperature , it would cause more resistance , because with temperature , comes heat , and heat just makes more resistance . lower temperatures allow the current to move more freely , which is why superconductors work really well at low temperatures . and length , well the longer the wire is , the more the resistance is going to build up along the whole thing ... the electrons are just encountering more resistance because the wire is longer..",0

"How did `` black comedy '' and `` rap music '' evolved from minstrel shows in America ? Minstrel shows were obstensibly a caricature of African-American culture , reaching the height of their popularity in the mid-19th Century.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_showBy and large , rap and hip-hop developed in the 1970 's as a natural progression from disco , jazz , beat poetry , raggae , and other African Diasporic cultural genres interacting with each other and creating something new.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_musicHumor , as an entertainment genre , created and performed by African-Americans does n't have much of a presence in American popular culture until the 70's.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_sitcomhttp : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special : Search ? search=african+american+comedians & go=GoIn this way , there 's not much of a direct relationship between minstrel shows and contemporary African-American entertainment in terms of `` lineage . '' However , racism - of which minstrel shows are one example - is a frequent topic of discussion.Example - In the `` When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong '' sketch of Chappelle 's Show Season 2 episode 7 : Dave plays Vernon Franklin , an African-American yuppie who feels like an `` Uncle Tom '' because he likes and gets along with his white co-workers . So instead of letting an awkward comment from co-worker and mentor Frank Murphy slide , he over-reacts.Frank : Vernon , great job buddy . You da man ! Give me some skin , huh ? Vernon : Get your m*f*in hand out of my face , man . You heard me m*f*er get your hand out of my face ! What you think this is - just shake my hand like a man ! .. ' Gim me some five , on the black-hand side , with all this crazy jive ' ? That 's b*s* . Do you want a little soft-shoe ? Should I juggle some watermelon ? Man ; f* all that ! Obviously , the humor is in the over-reaction . But at the same time , Chappelle is tapping into the sensitivity many people have concerning racial stereotypes : The comment about `` dancing a soft-shoe '' is a direct reference to minstrel show caricaturing of African-Americans .",0

"Would Americans like for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state ? Puerto Rico has been a colony for more than 100 years of the US and once again the isue has come up to decide for its political future , independence or statehood . I 'm sure Americans do n't want Puerto Rico to become a state . With a population larger than that of many other states , PR would be more powerful in Congress than those less populated states.As to FL Boy 's answer , I 'd say that although it would never become a major player , as an independent nation , PR definitely would n't be worthless in the world 's economy . it happens that PR is the world 's largest producer of prescription medicines and pacemakers.My comment on One 's answer is that thousands of Puerto Ricans serve and have served in all of the military branches of the U.S . They have also fought and died in the wars fought by the US , including Iraq and Desert Storm . During the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) , the 65th Infantry Division , made up entirely of Puerto Ricans , kicked some seroius North Korean behinds .

"Can you give me a overview of Memoirs of Geisha ? From Library Journal '' I was n't born and raised to be a Kyoto geisha ... .I 'm a fisherman 's daughter from a little town called Yoroido on the Sea of Japan . '' How nine-year-old Chiyo , sold with her sister into slavery by their father after their mother 's death , becomes Sayuri , the beautiful geisha accomplished in the art of entertaining men , is the focus of this fascinating first novel . Narrating her life story from her elegant suite in the Waldorf Astoria , Sayuri tells of her traumatic arrival at the Nitta okiya ( a geisha house ) , where she endures harsh treatment from Granny and Mother , the greedy owners , and from Hatsumomo , the sadistically cruel head geisha . But Sayuri 's chance meeting with the Chairman , who shows her kindness , makes her determined to become a geisha . Under the tutelage of the renowned Mameha , she becomes a leading geisha of the 1930s and 1940s . After the book 's compelling first half , the second half is a bit flat and overlong . Still , Golden , with degrees in Japanese art and history , has brilliantly revealed the culture and traditions of an exotic world , closed to most Westerners . Highly recommended.- ? Wilda Williams , `` Library Journal '' According to Arthur Golden 's absorbing first novel , the word `` geisha '' does not mean `` prostitute , '' as Westerners ignorantly assume -- it means `` artisan '' or `` artist . '' To capture the geisha experience in the art of fiction , Golden trained as long and hard as any geisha who must master the arts of music , dance , clever conversation , crafty battle with rival beauties , and cunning seduction of wealthy patrons . After earning degrees in Japanese art and history from Harvard and Columbia -- and an M.A . in English -- he met a man in Tokyo who was the illegitimate offspring of a renowned businessman and a geisha . This meeting inspired Golden to spend 10 years researching every detail of geisha culture , chiefly relying on the geisha Mineko Iwasaki , who spent years charming the very rich and famous.The result is a novel with the broad social canvas ( and love of coincidence ) of Charles Dickens and Jane Austen 's intense attention to the nuances of erotic maneuvering . Readers experience the entire life of a geisha , from her origins as an orphaned fishing-village girl in 1929 to her triumphant auction of her mizuage ( virginity ) for a record price as a teenager to her reminiscent old age as the distinguished mistress of the powerful patron of her dreams . We discover that a geisha is more analogous to a Western `` trophy wife '' than to a prostitute -- and , as in Austen , flat-out prostitution and early death is a woman 's alternative to the repressive , arcane system of courtship . In simple , elegant prose , Golden puts us right in the tearoom with the geisha ; we are there as she gracefully fights for her life in a social situation where careers are made or destroyed by a witticism , a too-revealing ( or not revealing enough ) glimpse of flesh under the kimono , or a vicious rumor spread by a rival `` as cruel as a spider . '' Golden 's web is finely woven , but his book has a serious flaw : the geisha 's true romance rings hollow -- the love of her life is a symbol , not a character . Her villainous geisha nemesis is sharply drawn , but she would be more so if we got a deeper peek into the cause of her motiveless malignity -- the plight all geisha share . Still , Golden has won the triple crown of fiction : he has created a plausible female protagonist in a vivid , now-vanished world , and he gloriously captures Japanese culture by expressing his thoughts in authentic Eastern metaphors.Amazon",0

"Should I start my kids ( 5 and 8 years old ) on skiing or snowboarding first ? I want them to learn both ? I would say skiing , and here is why : The first day out , you want your kids to have a good time . If they get a bad first impression , you could be in for fifteen years of boring vacations sitting on beaches or whatever non-skiers/boarders do on vacations . Anyne will tell you that the first day on a board you spend it on your rear end . I had big purple welts the first time . With skiing , you fall a little bit , but with separate feet you are at least standing most of the time . Secondly , when skiing , you gradually progress over many years to become an avid skier . With snowboarding , you either can snowboard or you ca n't . The kids will want to learn to snowboard , despite the bad first day , once they are into the whole winter sports thing . So use skiing to get them to have a good time , then , once they are parallel skiing , let them snowboard . about 18 years ago , when me and my brother were beginners , he switched to snowboarding . I waited another couple years . Now I do both expertly , and the one time he tried skiing , he broke his leg trying to keep up with me . He never mastered skiing because he could n't appreciate the slower learning process of the sport . kids are impatient . If they have a bad first ten minutes they want to go home . If it is too much work to learn something similar to something they are already good at , they wo n't learn it . good luck .",0

What is he into ? Here 's some ideas ( most of which you 'll be able to find on ebay ) .Music - First edition , signed recordsBooks - As aboveTrainers - Get the original trainers ( not re-release ) . Loads of sites out there like deludedmonkey.comSport - Is he into a particular team ? Get him a signed shirt.Blokes always love gadgets as well , although there 's something not terribly 'special birthday ' about them ( other than the price ) . You could try an ipod with a laser engraved message.Or ... how about you take him away for a weekend ? Take him to something he 'll love e.g . a really cool gig , a sports game ( where you wo n't moan ! ) or maybe a romantic break ...",0
"Have you seen Munich ? How was it ? are you referring to the city or the movie ? since your question 's in the movie category , i assume this is about the movie ? the one starring eric bana ? This movie attempts to illuminate both sides of Israel 's conflict . While the focus is on Israeli actions and choices , Palestinian and Arab motivations are present throughout the work . For me , Speilberg 's treatment of both sides was an attempt at balance . Neither side is commended or exaulted for their behavior . Instead , the film attempts to generally question the nature of their decisions and acts . If this film does make any stance on Israel and Palestine , it makes a general condemnation of the violence on both sides . Speilberg goes through great lengths to show the cycle of violence - lamenting the perpetual loss of life in violent conflict.The film 's conclusion extends Speilberg 's effort to question violence and its role in human affairs . The protagonist chooses against returning home - he lives in exile . The cycle of violence has taken a toll on him . I 'm unclear in deciding whether the protagonist approves or condemns of his own choices . But I do believe that he realizes that violence is not a future solution . I think that this was a geniune attempt at thoughtful reflection of the consequences of violent conflict . For a mainstream movie , this had unusual depth . I felt that there was an honest attempt to depict both sides as human beings - with rational , legitmate values and motivations . I would encourage anyone to see this film . Audiences should try to analyze both the film 's perspective and their our own beliefs on the real world content behind the work . Any film that can spark people to pose these serious questions deserves attention .",0

What about the Seneca Falls Convention sparked the women 's suffrage movement ? I am doing a documentary on the above topic and would like your help ! It brought women together for the first time to discuss these issues under the leadership of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott . These women had been active in the fight against slavery and were aware of women 's second grade status - there is an interesting parallel with second wave feminism a century later . It used the rhetoric of the Declaration of Independence to appeal to American ideas of political participation.Good luck with the documentary .,0

"what is the main ingredient in cocaine , where does it come from and what are the side efects of this drug ? it is extracted from the coca plant in south america , BUT there are so many other things that are in most batches of cocaine ( meaning cocaine is `` cut with '' other products ) such as analgesic drugs or even things like vitamin c or talcom powder , and most street coke is only around 40 % pure cocaine ... so its hard to say what the main ingredient is.the side effects depend on the frequency of use , how long you have been using , and how much you blow . an occaisonal user will probably experience little to no side effects , while a moderate user ( once or twice a week ) may begin to experince a `` drained '' feeling somewhere around 30-60 minutes after use , or a slight increase in irritability or other such things . a heavy user ( every day , multiple times a day ) will experience a pretty harsh come-down where one would feel exhausted , depressed , and like there is no point to doing anything because everything feels so BLAH and the only important or fun thing is drugs . they start to have mood swings , become irritated easily , paranoid , insomnia sets in which causes one to do more and more coke throughout the day to stay awake and live . it effects your life and your friends and at some point its hard to function in a normal day . pretty soon you NEED it , coke is all you think about . you think about when you can do it next , how much you have left , and where you can get it when you run out ... .i think that is probably all i can say at this point .",0

"'NASTERDAM ' who is this man ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Born in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in the south of France in December 1503 , Michel de Nostredame was the son of a grain dealer who was also a prosperous home-grown notary . His family was originally Jewish , but had converted to Catholicism during the previous century along with thousands of others , due to increasing official French persecution of Jews , many of whom were the descendants of former refugees from Spain , where they were known as the Marranos . The names of Nostredame 's known forebears seem to reflect this . While practice of the ancestral religion was often apparently continued in secret , nobody knows whether this applied to Nostredame 's family , or whether it still applied to him two generations later . ( It should be noted that the majority of Jews at the time frowned upon such 'cover conversions ' , not least because succeeding generations of offspring were inevitably more at risk to lose connection with their past , and thus with their roots and religion . ) His adult religious leanings suggest , however , that his upbringing was devoutly Catholic.This apart , nothing is known about his childhood , but at the age of fifteen he entered the University of Avignon to study for his baccalaureate . After little more than a year he was forced by the plague to leave again . In 1529 , after some years as an apothecary , he entered the University of Montpellier to study for a doctorate in medicine , but was promptly expelled again when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary , which was a 'manual ' trade expressly banned by the university statutes . He then continued work as an apothecary ( though some of his publishers and correspondents would later call him 'Doctor ' ) , and created a `` rose pill '' that was widely believed to protect against the the plague.In 1531 he was invited by Jules-César Scaliger , a leading Renaissance man , to come to Agen . There Nostradamus married a woman whose name is still in dispute ( possibly Henriette d'Encausse ) , but who bore him two children . In 1534 , however , his wife and children died , presumably from the plague . After their death he continued to travel , passing through France and possibly Italy.He settled down in 1547 in Salon-de-Provence , where he married a rich widow named Anne Ponsarde Gemelle and eventually had six children – three daughters and three sons . After a further visit to Italy , he began to move away from medicine and towards the occult . He wrote an almanac for 1550 , for the first time Latinising his name to 'Nostradamus ' , and was so encouraged by its success that he decided to write one or more annually . Taken together , they are known to have contained at least 6338 prophecies ( most of them , in the event , failed predictions – see Chevignard and Lemesurier ( 2 ) under Sources ) , as well as at least 11 annual calendars , all of them starting on 1st January and not , as is sometimes supposed , in March . He then began his project of writing 1,000 quatrains , which form the supposed prophecies for which he is famous today . Feeling vulnerable to religious fanatics , however , he devised a method of obscuring his meaning by using `` Virgilianised '' syntax , word games and a mixture of languages such as Provençal , Greek , Latin and Italian . For technical reasons connected with their publication in three instalments , the last 58 quatrains of the seventh 'Century ' , or book of 100 verses , did not survive into any extant edition.The quatrains , written in a book titled `` Les Propheties '' , received a mixed reaction when they were published . Some people thought Nostradamus was a servant of evil , a fake , or insane , while many of the elite thought his quatrains were spiritually inspired prophecies . Soon nobility were coming from far and wide to receive horoscopes and advice from him , though he normally expected them to supply the birthcharts on which they were based .

"why is the sky blue ? Space is black and the sun is like yellowish-orangish , so why blue , or sometimes gray The sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering . This effect was actually first observed and described by John Tyndall , and a only few years later was explored in more detail by Lord Rayleigh.Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of light by particles . In the case of the sky , these particles are the molecules of air , themselves , and not dust or water vapor as is often proferred . The scattering depends on the wavelength of the light . Light towards the violet end of the spectrum scatters more than light at the red end . Sunlight is scattered throughout the sky and causes it to appear blue to an observer on the ground . The reason the sky does n't appear violet to us has to do with the sensetivity of the cones in the human eye.Just as the blue light gets scattered , red light from the sun travels farther , which is why the sun appears yellowish-orangish . In space the sun appears noticeably more blue . Space is black because there are almost no particles to scatter light .",0
"Do schools even teach spelling anymore ? I mean , is it just assumed that Spell Check on MS Word makes spelling obsolete ? Do students still have to do things like in-class essays written by hand ? uv cores knott , hoo neads speleng ? Jusk kidding . They most certainly do still teach it . I know that I had to do in-class essays until I finished high school ( although I have yet to be asked to turn in a hand-written essay in college ) , and all the elementary school aged kids I know have weekly spelling words . Apparently , however , many people feel that publicly accessible online forums are not subject to the rules of spelling and grammar . My personal favorite was `` how to get accepted into a ivy league college ? '' Although `` do n't talk ur d_mb '' was also pretty good . It also seems that many people are under the delusion that `` ur , '' `` r , '' and `` n '' are actual words .",0
I need someones opinion . Which do u think is better living in a dorm going to college ? ORLive at home and go to college ? Living in a dorm all the way.It is important to learn the skills of living on your own before you are completely thrust out to live on your own . People grow up faster in my experience if they have to live in the dorms . Plus that way there is no commute and you have quick access to all the educational and social resources . Be careful about spending too much time with friends and making poor decisions . Those can come back to bite you without your parents looking over your shoulder . Act like a responsible adult and you should be fine .,0

"The weather just said we will have snow showers , but the current temp is 36 . Can snow form above freezing ? Your temprature of 36 degrees is simply a ground level temprature .

Once snow starts to form within the weather system , the ground temprature will begin to drop from 36 Degrees to around 30-28 degrees for a short period of time . From 22-28 degrees snow falls best . THe sudden drop in temprature is n't that hard to predict , so chances are your weather station was indeed correct .",0

"Why does TV always show gangsters and thugs holding pistols sideways ? Why does TV always show gangsters and thugs holding pistols sideways instead of the proper vertical orientation ? Is it just for the `` cool '' factor ? The same reason they hold microphones clear to the top thereby losing much of the useful pickup characteristics designed into the microphone . One person does it and someone thinks it 's cool then the next one does it and so on . Nevermind the fact that the sideways orientation of the firearm makes accuracy nearly impossible and kickback from the firearm dangerous , not to mention ejected hot shell casings will fly up into your face and go down your shirt that is cooly unbuttoned . How about the baggy pants that make running impossible , or the light up tennis shoes that make it easy for a police officer to follow a perp in the dark . Much of `` cool '' fashion is so foolish it 's laughable . I still have n't even figured out why the vocalists keep grabbing their crotch area then pointing at the audience while taking giant steps sideways . What is the most absurd about all of this is that all of the people following in lockstep repeating all of this crap are convinced that they are rugged individualists expressing their own unique personality . In reality they are simply reflecting what they have seen on the big glass brain stealer ( That 's TV ) . Well I got ta go now . It 's time for me to put on my stocking cap .

Maybe they should hold it upside down so it will fly out backwards and the flat back end of the bullet leave a bigger hole ?",0

"Is the Brady Bill based on a Nazi Gun Control Law ? I was told it was the exact same - almost word for translated word . Ridiculous . Is the law requiring cars to stop at a stop sign based on a Nazi law ? Because the laws are remarkably similar to laws in Nazi Germany requiring cars to stop at stop signs . ( One group has claimed that the origin of the distinction between guns suitable for sporting use and other guns comes from Nazi Germany . And the group further claims that when the Brady Bill attempts to outlaw private ownership of semi-automatic weapons ( which are only good for killing large numbers of people quickly , in war or otherwise , or practising to do so ) it is applying this distinction first developed in Nazi law . But 1 ) that is a far cry from the Brady Bill being a `` translation '' of Nazi legislation , 2 ) the Brady Bill ban on selected semi-automatic weapons is not the same as a ban on private ownership of any weapon not suitable for sporting use , and 3 ) the concept of a ban on such weapons in private hands goes back way before the Nazis , and existed throughout Europe , back into the days of Kings and nobility . It was not invented by the Nazis.Oppose gun control if you like . But this is not a reason to do so .",0

"Why ca n't conservatives really learn to conserve more ? seems most conservatives are only interested in conserving a wasteful greedy life-style ... If you are talking about conserving energy - this will not solve the energy problem . It 's only part of the solution . What really solves the problem is drilling and refining our own sources of energy off of our coasts and in ANWR - but that wo n't happen because tree hugging pus*y liberals like yourself would rather block domestic energy production and then whine about gas prices being too high . That 's why there has n't been an oil refinery built in this country for over 30 years . That 's why they have brownouts in California . All because of the environmental movement and their hatred of Capitalism . Raising the supply of energy is a sure fire way to make sure we never run out.This is true of ANY commodity . Let 's take Coca Cola for example . The reason a 12oz can of Coke only costs 75 cents from a vending machine is because that is the price that the market will bear . Now , close every Coca-Cola bottling plant in the country except one and keep the same amount of vending machines - what do you think would happen to the price ? It would skyrocket because there would n't be enough Coke to fill the vending machine demand.On the other hand , if you openend up Coca-Cola bottling plants on every steet corner in America - there would be so much Coke available that the price would plummet because they would have more Coca-Cola than vending machines to dispense them.The same would be true whether you are talking about energy , Coca-Cola , steel , guns , butter or newspapers.Instead of spouting off from your a $ $ , maybe you should learn some Economic facts first .",0

"What war was it when we were attacked by Japan at Pearl Harbor W W I or W W II ? it would help if you could also tell me the difference between the two World Wars besides one being the first and the other being the second . I ’ m getting too old , I can ’ t believe anyone would need to ask such a question.World War I , 1914–18 , also known as the Great War , conflict , chiefly in Europe , among most of the great Western powers . It was the largest war the world had yet seen.Causes World War I was immediately precipitated by the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist in 1914 . There were , however , many factors that had led toward war . Prominent causes were the imperialistic , territorial , and economic rivalries that had been intensifying from the late 19th cent. , particularly among Germany , France , Great Britain , Russia , and Austria-Hungary.Of equal importance was the rampant spirit of nationalism , especially unsettling in the empire of Austria-Hungary and perhaps also in France . Nationalism had brought the unification of Germany by blood and iron , and France , deprived of Alsace and Lorraine by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 , had been left with its own nationalistic cult seeking revenge against Germany . While French nationalists were hostile to Germany , which sought to maintain its gains by militarism and alliances , nationalism was creating violent tensions in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy ; there the large Slavic national groups had grown increasingly restive , and Serbia as well as Russia fanned Slavic hopes for freedom and Pan-Slavism.Imperialist rivalry had grown more intense with the new imperialism of the late 19th and early 20th cent . The great powers had come into conflict over spheres of influence in China and over territories in Africa , and the Eastern Question , created by the decline of the Ottoman Empire , had produced several disturbing controversies . Particularly unsettling was the policy of Germany . It embarked late but aggressively on colonial expansion under Emperor William II , came into conflict with France over Morocco , and seemed to threaten Great Britain by its rapid naval expansion.These issues , imperialist and nationalist , resulted in a hardening of alliance systems in the Triple Alliance and Triple Entente and in a general armaments race . Nonetheless , a false optimism regarding peace prevailed almost until the onset of the war , an optimism stimulated by the long period during which major wars had been avoided , by the close dynastic ties and cultural intercourse in Europe , and by the advance of industrialization and economic prosperity . Many Europeans counted on the deterrent of war 's destructiveness to preserve the peace.War 's Outbreak The Austrian annexation ( 1908 ) of Bosnia and Hercegovina created an international crisis , but war was avoided . The Balkan Wars ( 1912–13 ) remained localized but increased Austria 's concern for its territorial integrity , while the solidification of the Triple Alliance made Germany more yielding to the demands of Austria , now its one close ally . The assassination ( June 28 , 1914 ) of Archduke Francis Ferdinand at Sarajevo set in motion the diplomatic maneuvers that ended in war.The Austrian military party , headed by Count Berchtold , won over the government to a punitive policy toward Serbia . On July 23 , Serbia was given a nearly unacceptable ultimatum . With Russian support assured by Sergei Sazonov , Serbia accepted some of the terms but hedged on others and rejected those infringing upon its sovereignty . Austria-Hungary , supported by Germany , rejected the British proposal of Sir Edward Grey ( later Lord Grey of Fallodon ) and declared war ( July 28 ) on Serbia.Russian mobilization precipitated a German ultimatum ( July 31 ) that , when unanswered , was followed by a German declaration of war on Russia ( Aug. 1 ) .

"Can diffusion take place in solids ? Yes.Orthoclase feldspar is an example . At high temperatures , Fe will fit into the orthoclase lattice . As temperature drops , the lattice shrinks so that Fe no longer fits . Fe diffuses out of the latice and accumulates along the planes between orthoclase crystal twins . Along the way , it grabs O to produce Fe2O3 . If you look closely at pink granite , usually you will see that the pink grains are actually white and red striped . Those grains are orthoclase crystals with exsolved hematite along twin planes.Exsolution and diffusion of Fe from orthoclase can only occur at high temperature . If the orthoclase cools too quickly for the Fe to diffuse out , it will remain in the orthoclase lattice , which will be distorted to accomodate the larger ( larger than K ) Fe ion.Material science is not boring .",0

"why is there only one timezone in china ? There is only one time-zone in China because the government there regulates it to be that way . Time-zones are largely a convention , and given the use of UTC time ( Universal Coordinated Time / Greenwich Mean Time ) , time-zones are not entirely necessary . They are predominantly kept because of familiarity and historical convention . That said , in China it is easier for the nation to function administratively with only one time-zone , so they have chosen that . In the United States , the government chose to have time-zones for the people over administrative reasons ... although some regions of the country ( such as parts of Indiana and Arizona ) have selected rules that do not follow the national norm ( i.e . they do n't use Daylight Savings Time ) .",0

"plossl 's seven supply chain points ? 1 . Satisfy the customer ’ s real needs not wants– For effective supply chain management , the real customers ’ needs must be satisfied , not their wants.2 . Understand how the real world works- The more quickly information moves , the more value it has.The same fact is true for supply chain management.- Being able to execute quickly can remove the need toforecast.- Material will expand to fill the space provided.3 . Have a complete integrated system– A complete system includes both planning and executionmanagement.– Plan will change but to fail to plan in planning to fail.– Changes and variability are expected events . The morequickly an enterprise can react , the less cost is incurred by theoperation.– System effectiveness is inversely proportional to thecomplexity.4 . Accurate data- Without accurate data , the best hardware and software will benothing but a big money pit and provide no return oninvestment.5 . Manage cycle time– Cycle time is the amount of time that elapses between materialentering and exiting a production facility.– Do not release orders to the floor unless all material and capacity isavailable to run it.6 . Eliminate nonvalue-added activity- It is not say that every implementation should embrace “ industrybest practices ” if these processes do not help the enterprise achieveits goals.- Keep implementation costs down rather than driving higher returnon investment.- Eliminating nonvalue-added activity means that one shouldn ’ tautomate bad process.7 . Fully qualified People- What business are they themselves in ? - Where does their work fit into the total business ? - Who are your customers ?

I assure you , this is a false sense of security . Do not trust the hardware or software to do the whole job for you.I believe the primary reason why computers get a virus is a lack of common sense . To wit ... - Be skeptical of anything you receive in e-mail that was not solicited , especially if it has an attachment.- Think twice before downloading that freeware.- Avoid Kazaa and the like.- Do review website certificates to satisfy yourself that the site you 're heading for is really the site you wanted to go to.- Make sure you download and install every security patch your OS vendor provides . You should manually review your vendor at least weekly ... even if you have an automatic update feature.A few minutes spent on satisfying yourself that you 've done everything you can do will provide you with peace of mind .",0

"How do you create HD 3D video games for the PS3 or XBox 360 ? It 's important that it 's HD . If possible , can youlist the name of software that helps ? I do n't know much about console programming.ALso , along with the software name , can you give me web sites that might help , and a number of the best programming languages . What you need is the SDK ( Software Development Kit ) for the particular console that you are developing for . Unfortunally these kits usually cost $ 10+ and even more unfortunally you ca n't get them . Most Console license holders ( like Microsoft or Sony ) will only lease a kit to you if you a big company with an active title in development and a published deal ready . It is almost impossible to get a kit if you are a single developer.I suggest making a PC game with DirectX , the directX SDK is free . It is a good place to get started and Microsoft 's Xbox uses a very similar almost identical interface . So if you can swing a publisher deal and convince Microsoft to let use use a SDK you wo n't have much trouble getting your game to work on the XBox.When you game is ready License holder will put your game through a set of rigorious tests to see if it is stable and conforms to all the rules of the particular system , if that all works out they will allow you to release the game.Almost every professional game with VERY few exceptions are written in C++.Compared to all this making the game work on a HD Televison is trival .",0

"Which religion preaches most hatred & violence ? please Be honest and speak out even if it is ur own religion. ? All religions resort to hatred and violence . It just happens that Islam is the one doing it now . Christianity used to be the evil one , killing people who did n't `` believe '' for political reasons , invading the `` holy land '' for power grabs . Even today , Christianity still uses hatred for its unifying effect , labelling gays as evil , vile sinners - any religion gets stronger when it devises a common enemy . Religion is simply a way to control people , so violence and hatred go hand in hand with this - if you want to strengthen your hold on people , give them a common enemy - then they 'll do anything you ask . Works for Islam , works for Christianity .",0

"Is something wrong with YAHOO Fantasy sports ? ? I am not sure what exactly you mean . If you mean technical problems ? well sometimes the log in page doesn ' load and I have to refresh the page a few times . That seems to be a Yahoo problem in generalif you mean the game itself , it is generally good but I would suggest some improvements.1- the number one improvement that is absolutely necessary is the IR/IL lists . Sometimes other website report that certain players , eg . Ed Jovonavski or Amare Stoudomire have been put on the IR . Yahoo however , does n't follow suit immidiately , they are a few days late . They have to keep in mind that those few days are very important for some of us . 2- KEPPER LEAGUE OPTION : I play Keeper leagues , meaning that I have inherited a team and its minor league system ( in case of hockey ) . I get to trade draft picks , prospects and active players . I think it would be better if Yahoo had a keeper league option . a ) That way we would n't have to set up a new league every season . b ) I 'd also suggest that they have a minor league section as part of this keeper league option . We could then keep our prospects who are not yet part of the NHL on our minor league roster . That way no other GM accidentally picks these guys up and also we wo n't forget about one of our many prospects . c ) When trades occure , they need to announce to the other GM 's all parts of the trade . As you know , when you trade in Yahoo leagues , it also gives the GM an comment box in which people that play keeper leagues put names of prospects or draft picks . As it 's currently set , these comments do n't appear to the other GM 's when the trade is accepted . For us the active players that are exchanged is one thing , most of the time it 's the draft picks and prospects that are the real deal makers . Right now GMs have to post extra comments letting everyone else know of the trade . IMO that needs to change.that 's it for now till I think of other things .",0

"Why is the sky blue ? Light is a kind of energy that can travel through space . Light from the sun or a light bulb looks white , but it is really a mixture of many colors . The colors in white light are red , orange , yellow , green , blue and violet . You can see these colors when you look at a rainbow in the sky.Rainbow PictureThe sky is filled with air . Air is a mixture of tiny gas molecules and small bits of solid stuff , like dust.As sunlight goes through the air , it bumps into the molecules and dust . When light hits a gas molecule , it may bounce off in a different direction . Some colors of light , like red and orange , pass straight through the air . But most of the blue light bounces off in all directions . In this way , the blue light gets scattered all around the sky.When you look up , some of this blue light reaches your eyes from all over the sky . Since you see blue light from everywhere overhead , the sky looks blue .",0

"what happens when you quit a job because of depression ? Can you get it back ? I quit my job as a teacher due to expected bouts of depression . I went to a doctor . I was told by a rep that I had to quit since I was so new . I mean I didnt get formally diagnosed or treated . I didnt want to quit , but I felt it was my only option . I want to be a teacher again in the NYC Teaching Fellows . They said they dont reinstate anyone , however , this was unexpected and it is a illness . With treatment , I can improve . What are the chances that I can plead for my job back ? When you quit a job for any reason , you do n't usually have the option of getting it back just by asking . You will probably have to reapply to the position -- if it 's still available -- and go through the whole interview process again.The only way this situation would have been different due to your depression would be if they had offered short-term disability . I 'm not sure if this was offered , especially since you were new , but this option typically puts your position on hold while you are recovering/going through treatment . However , doing this for mental illnesses is n't always the same as a physical injury/disability , as it 's usually more helpful for a person to keep working and going through a normal routine.Anyway , it seems like you will probably have to reapply to the position . If you were forced to quit though , rather than go on disability , you might have a legal case against them , but this is only a guess .",0

"Although we see with two eyes a given object we see only one image.Why not two ? Although we see with two eyes , each of which creates its own , slightly different image , we normally have single vision , meaning we see only one image of an object . This is because your brain can normally control the muscles that move each eye carefully so that both are pointing accurately at the object you are looking at . When each eye produces its own image , your brain then joins them together into one . This gives us what is called ‘ single binocular vision ’ .Double vision can be an effect that you can create yourself . For example , if you hold your finger in front of your eyes and then look past it into the distance , you will experience double vision . This is normal .",0

"who discovered the atom ? Democritus and Leucippus , Greek philosophers in the 5th century BC , presented the first theory of atoms ( see article atomism for more details ) . The Greeks believed that atoms were all made of the same material but had different shapes and sizes , which determined the physical properties of the material . For instance , the atoms of a liquid were thought to be smooth , allowing them to slide over each other . This theory was not founded on experimental evidence.In 1808 , John Dalton proposed that an element is composed of a single , unique type of atoms , and that whilst their shape or structure was immutable , atoms of different elements could combine to form more complex structures ( compounds ) . Through his experiments , Dalton discovered the law of multiple proportions - that is , if two elements form more than one compound between them , then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers .",0

"What is Islam and why is Islam ? What is Islam ? Islam is not a new religion , but the same truth that God revealed through all His prophets to every people . For a fifth of the world 's population , Islam is both a religion and a complete way of life . Muslims follow a religion of peace , mercy , and forgiveness , and the majority have nothing to do with the extremely grave events which have come to be associated with their faith.Who are the Muslims ? One billion people from a vast range of races , nationalities and cultures across the globe - from the southern Philippines to Nigeria - are united by their common Islamic faith . About 18 % live in the Arab world ; the world 's largest Muslim community is in Indonesia ; substantial parts of Asia and most of Africa are Muslim , while significant minorities are to be found in the Soviet Union , China , North and South America , and Europe.What do Muslims believe ? Muslims believe in One , Unique , Incomparable God ; in the Angels created by Him ; in the prophets through whom His revelations were brought to mankind ; in the Day of Judgement and individual accountability for actions ; in God 's complete authority over human destiny and in life after death . Muslims believe in a chain of prophets starting with Adam and including Noah , Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob , Joseph , Job , Moses , Aaron , David , Solomon , Elias , Jonah , John the Baptist , and Jesus , peace be upon them . But God 's final message to man , a reconfirmation of the eternal message and a summing-up of all that has gone before was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through Gabriel.What does 'Islam ' mean ? The Arabic word 'Islam ' simply means 'submission ' , and derives from a word meaning 'peace ' . In a religious context it means complete submission to the will of God . 'Mohammedanism ' is thus a misnomer because it suggests that Muslims worship Muhammad rather than God . 'Allah ' is the Arabic name for God , which is used by Arab Muslims and Christians alike .",0

"Why does my new computer suddenly run very slow when CD-R is accessing data ? ( This is a new problem. ) ? Even when Winamp is playing an mp3 from the hard drive , it will suddenly play very slowly if the CD-R reads something on a CD for another program . It did n't do this when the computer was new ( 3 months ago ) , but just started . instead of ripping CD audio at 18X , it is around 7X now . It 's hard to say what could be the exact cause of the problem , but most problems with speed on a computer somehow tie back to Spyware issues . Many times spyware/adware programs that are running in the background ( depending on which type ) will try to access all your drives ( not only the CD drive , but the HDD as well ) and decrease your machine 's performance . The other possiblity could be a hardware issue , as a technician , I 've seen many times data cables go bad or CD motors fail . You could be running out of RAM , Since the machine is only about 3 months old , i doubt very much it 's hardware ( but i 'd definitely suggest getting the Laser cleaned with a CD laser cleaner ) . The problem is most likely software related ( either spyware or a settings issue ( like a DMA setting or something ) ) . Either way , since you 're more than likely to be under some kind of mfg . warranty , i 'd take advantage and call them up , for some kind of support .",0

My opinion is with quality sex you do not have to orgasm every time , but you most always do just because you are so in love that the other person touching you sends a warm tingley feeling all over your body ! ( no pun intended )",0
properties of a gentleman ? Kindess ; consideration of others needs/feelings above his own ; smiles & nods his head or tips his hat when passing a lady ( young or old ) on the street ; opens doors for ladies ; when walking with a lady down the street he makes sure shes on the inside for her protection ; never uses fowl language in front of women or children ; loves his mother and isnt afraid to show it ; loves his wife ( or g/f ) and children and would rather come home to them then go out partying with his friends ; respect for the law and even more respect for the law Giver ( God ) ; stands up-removes his hat and sings loudly & proudly when the Star Spangled banner is played at sporting events ; also stands & removes hat and maybe even applauds when a color gaurd displaying our Flag passes him during a parade ; and isnt embarrassed by either of these ! Absolute respect for those men and women who gave their lives for our country and just as much respect for those who faught and came home again . These are just a few of the traits of a gentleman in my opinion .,0

This was not a secret that was kept from you and you knew what you were getting into before you got married .

Have you confronted him about it and have you shared your feelings with him about this ? Is this relationship with this person really that important to you ?

"How to put in color ink from an ink installation kit ? I have a Lexmark Z611 printer and I have an emty ink cartridge but I have this kit were I can put more ink into it but I do n't know exactly were to drill the holes to put in some more color ink . Can someone help me ? Your cartridge needs to have the top popped in order to refill . HOWEVER , make sure the cartridge has not been run empty , or it will not respond to refilling . Also if you have removed the cartridge and it is just sitting on your desk , then it will not respond either . The printhead needs to be kept damp , or protected . The last thing you need to know is that you MUST have lexmark 10n0026 ink . If you bought one of the universal kits , you may be stuck with ink that is too thin and will leak , or ink that is too thick and will clog.Once you determine that all is OK , simply use a knife to pry off the top of the cartridge , and if you can not tell which color goes where , use a tooth pick to determine which color is where . these are small cartridges and will not require much ink , so fill very slowly . Watch the printhead and the top of the cartridge at the same time . At the first sign of ink coming from the print head - STOP and pull back a bit on the needle ( a very little bit ) . You should also watch the top of the cartridge , as to avoid having the ink pour out of the top . Repeat for all colors . Hope this helps.If you have to remove the cartridge prior to refilling , then you should place it in a zipper bag along with a slightly damp paper towel , until you can get to it . It must remain moist , but not wet , and do not store in the freezer .",0

"Is it ever okay to get a divorce in the eyes of God ? What if you married an aethiest or an agnostic ? What if your husband beats you to a pulp continuously ... and there are kids involved ? What if your husband is cheating on you ... and wo n't stop ? Are you just supposed to stick it out because of the vows you took ? ( This really is n't a personal experience question so I do n't need advice on how to go to a woman 's shelter or anything ) . Although I am answering from a Catholic perspective , the theology is fairly universal.Jesus forbade divorce , except in cases of adultery . However , a divorce also implies that there was a marriage . This tends to be the angle that the Catholic church approaches the breakdown of a legal marriage , and that is , `` was it even a marriage ? `` Marriage is , as Jesus puts it , `` when two become one flesh '' , people whom God himself has `` joined together . '' A sacramental moment of that magnitude requires that people enter it with full consent , and that consent requires both the personal maturity to give that consent as well as having all the information needed to make that consent . Take abuse , for instance - abuse implies a kind of marital fraud . Nobody would knowingly start dating someone who they knew was going to beat them , right ? An abusive person is always going to put their best foot forward at first and hide that aspect of themselves until a time when they feel safe to let it out . This is a fraud - and if a person marries such a person , they are n't doing it with that full consent of the will necessary for a marriage to truly exist.So a civil divorce may not always be a wrong thing to do , if it really is more of an annulment of a marriage that never truly was.Also - the other thing to keep in mind , is that what Jesus specifically condemned was divorce and remarriage , not divorce alone . So even if the marriage was valid in the eyes of God - i.e . abuse , lies , fraud , alcoholism were n't part of the breakdown , it was a valid marriage - it is only remarriage that he 's actually condemned.An aside : marriage was not created by the state . It long predates the state . Marriage was deeded to the state by religion ...",0

I am not really familiar with mountain river fishing , but I 'll go out on a limb and say that if there is n't a lot of catfish , then maybe the water is too cool where you are fishing.Cats are warm water lovers for the most part ( unless you are fishing for blues in the winter ) so maybe try a river system that is a little warmer.A writer , who was obviously smarter than me , cause I ca n't recall his name , said that catfish and trout do n't mix , so if you are fishing a trout stream , try fishing farther downstream where the river warms up .",0

"What do you think about the recent trade between sczerbiak and ricky davis ? This trade definitely sucked for the twolves . Davis for Szczerbiak is a good trade , as they 're both swingmen with different strengths . Boston needed a big guy that can spot shoot , and Minnesota needed a guard . The problem with the trade is with the secondary players . The Twolves gave up Michael Olowokandi and a first round pick for the crappy Celtics players and 2 conditional late second round picks . Getting rid of Olowokandi and Sczcerbiak leaves KG as the only big man on the Twolves.Since neither team will make the playoffs this year , Boston will definitely get a lottery pick from Minnesota , and they 'll get to keep their own . Minnesota will get at the most two late second round picks . Or as I like to call them `` the since we have to pick someone , we 'll pick you '' draft picks.I never thought I 'd say this , but Kevin McHale stinks .",0

"Should car be banned in city centre ? Please give me the reason and more details because I need to write a arguement essay on it . Well , there are two sides to this issue - I do n't know if you are arguing in favor , or against it - so here goes.On the plus side ( i.e . banning cars in the city center ) , you would reduce traffic , congestion , wear and tear on the streets . You could hold events ( parades , celebrations , rally 's , etc . ) in the area without significantly affecting traffic . Also , car-free areas in the downtown ( i.e . city center ) can help to revitalize an area of the downtown - it can be made to look nice , maybe with something like nice bricks , or cobblestones.On the other hand ( against banning cars in the city center ) , if you ban cars in the downtown area , you 'll be loosing revenue from on-street parking and any parking tickets the city issues , depending upon the size of the car-free area , it will be more difficult to get to the city center , it might adversely affect sales for businesses in the affected area.One option , used in downtown Minneapolis ( Nicollet Mall ) allows taxis and busses , but not private ( i.e . car ) traffic . This allows people to get down to the area via public transportation , or by taking a taxi . Of course , it 's only one block wide by several ( 5 or 6 I think ) blocks long.Here are two sites that might provide helpful information : http : //www.worldcarfree.net/http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_street",0

"What is Eid al Adha ? Eid ul-Adha ( Arabic : عيد الأضحى ) occurs on the tenth day of the Islamic month of Dhul Hijja . It is one of two Eid festivals that Muslims celebrate . Eid ul-Adha is celebrated by Muslims worldwide as a commemoration of Prophet Ibrahim 's willingness to sacrifice his son for God.Muslims believe that God revealed in a dream to Ibrahim ( Prophet Abraham ) to sacrifice his son Isma ’ il . Ibrahim and Isma ’ il set off to Mina for the sacrifice . As they went , the devil attempted to persuade Ibrahim to disobey God and not to sacrifice his beloved son . But Ibrahim stayed true to God , and drove the devil away . As Ibrahim prepared to sacrifice his son , God stopped him and gave him a sheep to sacrifice instead . The story is also a part of the other Abrahamic religionsIt is celebrated on the 10th day of the month of Dhul Hijja ( ذو الحجة ) of the lunar Islamic calendar , after Hajj , the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia . This happens to be approximately 70 days after the end of the month of Ramadan.While Eid ul-Fitr is considered to be three days , Eid ul-Adha is supposed to be four days . The first day is the primary holiday , on which men , women , and children are expected to dress in their finest clothing and perform prayer ( Salah ) in a large congregation . Muslims who can afford to do so sacrifice domestic animals , usually sheep , as a symbol of Ibrahim 's sacrifice ; this sacrifice is called `` Qurban . '' The meat is distributed amongst their neighbors , relatives , and the poor and hungry . The charitable instincts of the Muslim community are demonstrated during Eid ul-Adha by the concerted effort to see that no impoverished Muslim is left without sacrificial food during this day . Coming immediately after the Day of Arafat ( when Muhammad pronounced the final seal on the religion of Islam ) , Eid ul-Adha gives concrete realization to what the Muslim community ethic means in practice .",0

Also , abuser often controlls money , could threaten to kill victim if she leaves ( most victims get killed when trying to leave ) hurt victims ' children , other family members or pets .",0

"Nicolatians believe ... .. ? In the bible . The doctrine of the Nicolaitans was mentioned in the Apocalypse of John to the churches of Pergamos and Ephesus of the seven churches of Asia in Revelation 2 . It was a symbolic name of a party that represents the hierarchy of a ruling class over the rest of the people , developing a `` pecking order '' of fleshly leadership . Jesus hated this and warns the people to repent or else `` I will come upon you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth . '' The same warning illustration is applied to those that abused grace , which led to licentiousness from the example of Balaam , seducing Christians to fornication and tampering with idolatry . The individual overcomer is allowed to eat of the hidden manna and given a white stone with a new name written in it.The Early church father Iranaeus , identified the Nicolaitans in his treatise `` Against Heresies '' in the second century as they who are an `` offshoot of the knowledge which is falsely so-called , '' mentioning that they `` lead lives of unrestrained indulgence . '' There is no absolute proof that the heretic Nicolas was the Deacon of the same name from Antioch of the seven deacons in the book of Acts , but Iranaeus supposed him to be so . Ignatius mentions the Nicolaitans also , so there was in fact a heretical group existing at that time . Nicolas the deacon was perhaps confused with another Nicolas , the bishop Nicolas of Samaria who was a heretic in the company of Simon Magus.The root of the word Nicolaitans comes from Greek nikao , to conquer or overcome , and laos , which means people and which the word laity comes from . The two words together especially means the destruction of the people and refers to the earliest form of what we call a priestly order or clergy which later on in church history divided people and allowed for leadership other than those led by the spirit of the risen Lord Jesus Christ . A good translation of Nicolaitan would be `` those who prevail over the people . '' This clerical system later developed into the papal hierarchy of priests and clergy lording over the flock . The Council of Trent stated , `` If anyone shall say that there is not in the Catholic Church a hierarchy established by the divine ordination , consisting of bishops , presbyters and ministers , let him be anathema . '' It is not the question of the ministries but rather in the separation of them into a hierarchy over the people . This very idea was taken over by the Protestants with their own corruption of leadership roles and coverings . The Church of Ephesus was commended for hating the deeds of the Nicolaitans . The wrong separation of the clergy from the laity is a great evil in God 's sight and He hates the lust for religious power . There is an ungodly spiritual authority in the Church today , which is nothing more than the prideful spirit of control , manipulation , domination and intimidation and a rebellion of the rightful authority of God.Faithful believers who have put on Christ Jesus , are all God 's laity . Peter exhorted us to Feed the flock of God which is among you , taking the oversight thereof , not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind . Neither as being lords over God 's heritage but being examples to the flock . And when the chief shepherd shall appear , you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.Shepherds serve the sheep but the wolves that clothe themselves with so-called leadership and spiritual authority serve themselves , thinking that they serve God . In essence , this makes them false christs . Early church leaders were established as overseers , not a ruling hierarchy .",0

"Pope Benedict 's stance on the Charasmatic Renewal ? What is Pope Benedicts stance on the Charasmatic Renewal of the Catholic Church . I recieved the Holy Ghost , with tongues , in Catholicism.I was under the impression then that Pope John Paul II had a favorable attitude towards it , but what about the current Pope Benedics ? I think that Pope Benedict is in support of this movement in general , though he , like others in the Catholic hierarchy , has some concerns about it . He seems to support the movement , but reminds members to stay connected to the whole Church . The quotation below is from before he was elected Pope . For his part , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , has added his voice to the Pope 's in acknowledging the good occurring in the Charismatic Renewal and providing some cautions . In a forward to a book by Cardinal Suenens , at that time the Pope 's delegate to the Charismatic Renewal , the Prefect comments on the Post-Conciliar period stating , '' At the heart of a world imbued with a rationalistic skepticism , a new experience of the Holy Spirit suddenly burst forth . And , since then , that experience has assumed a breadth of a worldwide Renewal movement . What the New Testament tells us about the charisms - which were seen as visible signs of the coming of the Spirit - is not just ancient history , over and done with , for it is once again becoming extremely topical . `` Speaking of the book 's subject , renewal and the powers of darkness , he says , '' What is the relation between personal experience and the common faith of the Church ? Both factors are important : a dogmatic faith unsupported by personal experience remains empty ; mere personal experience unrelated to the faith of the Church remains blind . `` Finally , he urges those who read the book to pay special attention to the author 's double plea , '' ... to those responsible for the ecclesiastical ministry - from parish priests to bishops - not to let the Renewal pass them by but to welcome it fully ; and on the other ( hand ) ... to the members of the Renewal to cherish and maintain their link with the whole Church and with the charisms of their pastors . `` [ Renewal and the Powers of Darkness , Leo Cardinal Suenens ( Ann Arbor : Servant Books , 1983 ) ]",0

"Any one knows about PMP anything ? Need more informations ! ! ? PMP is `` Progect Management Professional '' ..Any body knows something about it ... What is the difference between this & MBA ? ? Any body has it ? what is the benefit ? ? PMP is a Project Management certification given by PMI ( Project Management Institute ) . To become PMP certified you need to clear a 4 hrs option-based exam . To qualify for it you would require 4500 PM hrs under various Process Areas and at least 35 hrs of PM training from a certified institute . The course material you are tested on is called Project Manaement Book Of Knowledge ( PMBOK ) . An MBA is a more comprehensive course where you can specialise in the area of your choice such as Marketing , Finance etc . PMP is more focused on Project Management and aspect related to it.Which of the two is better depends really on what your aim is and what you are looking to achieve from it .",0

"While teaching grammar to students of English , are we allowed to use their mother tongue ? or English alone ? That 's a good question . Most countries that employ native English speakers to teach English do NOT want the teachers to speak anything but English . This can be beneficial for the students because they are literally flooded with English and have no resort but to learn as the days go by . It is akin to learning through immersion - which , from experience I can say is the best and easiest way to learn a language . If it 's all you hear all day long , you pick it up fast.However , it can be very difficult and daunting for students to hear only a language they have n't yet learned . When I taught English in Thailand , I could only speak English to them because I had n't yet learned Thai . But once I had enough Thai under my belt to speak to the students in their own language , it made it a LOT easier to make them understand the English I was trying to teach.So there are advantages and disadvantages to both ways . Just do your best and see what works .",0

"What is the best AMD64 CPU for multitasker/gamer ? among athlon , athlon x2 , opteron , opteron x2 . price range 400 and under . I highly recommend the Athlon 64 X2 3800+ dual core processor if you are thinking of multitasking . Each core is based pretty much on the Venice core , and has 512 KB L2 cache . Each core runs at 2.0GHz , which is the same speed as the 90 nanometer process Athlon 64 3200+.For about the same price , the best single core processor is the Athlon 64 4000+ , with the San Diego core . It has 1MB of L2 cache . This is likely a better gaming processor than the X2 3800+ , because it has has a 400MHz speed advantage in one thread . It also has a 1MB L2 cache.Currently , all mainstream games are single threaded , meaning that they ca n't utilize the capabilities that dual core processors have . The dual core processor will perform very nicely in the environment of your operating system , but it wo n't have an advantage in gaming . Most people predict that multi-threaded PC games will become more common in the next few years , but there is a good chance they will do nicely on older single threaded systems at lower speeds.When it comes to games , your graphics card is far more important than the speed of your processor . Normal multitasking benefits most from the processor.Overall , I would recommend the Athlon 64 X2 3800+ .",0

"How is `` Evolution '' plausible or logical ? Simply because Darwin used well developed ( by humans , but well developed nonetheless ) , well proven , scientific methodolgy instead of relying on the dogmas of a belief system to base his observations on.Keep in mind that , in science , there are very few laws any longer . Everything is a theory because , especially after relativity , scientists discovered that our universe does n't stay consistent as you move into and out of certain states ( like the speed of light ) . However , this does not eliminate the theory as quackery or false . It means that the theory can only be applied in certain circumstances ( it 's relative to certain states ) so it can not be a `` law '' as laws are immutable.That being said , science only has observable evidence as it 's foundation ( or provable evidence through mathematics ) . Darwin observed the various species on the Galapagos islands and drew conclusions as to the nature of their adaptations ( long beaks , short beaks , etc. ) . He also observed that various birds with nearly identical characteristics had slight variations in their adaptations . This caused him to draw other conclusions . In short , he used a scientific process to develop early versions of his theory of evolution . It has been scrutinized since , and the only ones `` disproving '' it have been those who belive religious texts are God 's absolute word.I am a believer in Christ , yet I see no issue with believing there is truth to Darwin 's theories . Did God ultimately create all things ? Of course He did . However , is the Bible absolute in it 's description in the origins of life ? Probably not . Even Christ , according to the biblical record , spoke in stories ( parables ) most of the time so people would understand his message and have examples to work from . He rarely spoke in absolutes , and when he did it was usually only with the apostles.I belive that Genesis is a parable describing God 's creation of all that is , in an understandable way since it is unlikely that we will ever completely understand how He did it . However , even I admit it is only a belief , and may be wrong , like Darwin may be wrong , or literal interpretations of Genesis may be wrong .",0

Feeling that some God is watching you at all times and that your actions are ethically important because you may win or lose cookie points with that deity , not because of their intrinsic moral value , is n't that paranoia ?

"Can anyone help me with algabra ? i do n't understand the geomitry part of a algabra it confuses me I do n't understand how to simplify square routes . When you square a number you are multiplying it by itself . For example 3ft x 3ft = 9 square feet or 3 squared = 9 . But if you had a real square ( a box top with equal sides like a huge pizza box ) and each side was 3 feet , the area of the box would be 3ft x 3ft = 9 sq-ft. You can think of squaring a number as the geometric operation of taking the sides of a square and multiplying them to get the square area as shown.Taking a square root is just the opposite . You start with the square area of the box top and find the sides . If the box top is 9 square feet you want to know the value of any two sides ( the other two sides will be the same ) . a square area of 9 sq-ft = 3ft x 3ft . There are methods for calculating square feet or it can be done using a hand calculator , but it helps to know what is really going on.When you square a number or find the square root of a number you can also use pure numbers ( 3 or 9 rather than 3ft or 9 sq-ft ) and there does n't need to be any real pizza box involved even though you use the word `` square .

"Are Space and Time continuous or are them quantized ? There are two major theories of modern physics : Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity . Both work well , with QM being applicable to atomic and smaller sizes , and GR to large ( Solar size , galaxy size , etc . ) things.The major question in physics today is : how do we combine QM and GR so that they are two aspects of one larger theory . This postulated theory is usually called a Unified Theory or Theory of Everything or something like that . String theories are attempts to do this ( so far all are still incomplete ) .The major difference between QM and GR is that nn QM energy comes in discrete levels ( all way to small for us to notice ) . However in GR space-time is continious . So it is not instantly clear whether space-time is continous or quantized in a unified theory.For consistency between these space quantization would have to be on extremely small scales . This would almost certain occur ( if it did ) at distances called the Planck length , which is ~ 10^-33 cm . ( This is about one billion trillion times smaller than an atomic nucleus . ) Quantization of time would then be the interval for light to cross this distance , about 10^-43 seconds . It is because of a lack of a unified theory that physicists ca n't say anything about the conditions of the universe before 10^-43 seconds after the Big Bang . ( Of course that is still pretty good . ) The short answer is : no one knows , but the scale of quantization would have to be much , much smaller than any known elementary particle .",0

"who should make the first move . the girl or the guy ? I have liked this guy from church for about three years , and i think he likes me too . The thing is i will not go up to him b/c it might make me look desperate . Im waitng for him to say something , but i got nothing . So who should make the first move ? Personally , I would rather let the guy make the first move . But , sometimes guys need help in doing this especially if he is a super shy one . One thing that you can do is give hints to him that you like him.If he truly likes you , he probably have sent you some birthday gifts , valentine cards , or something.Respond to his tiny move by telling him that you appreciates his gestures.make it the LAST effort for you to actually make the first move.personally , i would not think a girl is desperate when she makes the first move ( actually , i think it 's pretty cool ) .BUT , I am just one guy .

"Should I get a Master 's in Special Education or Public Policy ? I enjoy both fields . I currently have a bachelor 's in Finance , a field I 'm not too interested in.In the past I had a two year internship with my State Senator and a 1 year job as a special ed instructional assistant . I enjoyed both positions.Paying for it is not too much of a problem either as the state offers loan reimbursements for special ed teachers and the school of public policy is offering generous scholarships.So perhaps it comes down to job availability . There is definately a big need for special ed teachers . I do n't know how easy it is to get a legislative job however , although if it is possible I may really enjoy it.What do you think ? While public policy is an undoubedly exciting field , the rewards you 'll get and receive in special education are certainly among the most satisfying available.You have an opportunity to positively affect countless children and adults with challenges far beyond the average person . In the end , you have to follow your heart . I suggest searching it carefully to see what it holds for this field . The best of luck to you !",0

"what is the purpose of the reverse stapling feature of a stapler ? On a hand stapler you have a silver metal anvil on the base of the stapler . This anvil is where the staple legs are formed either in an inward ( standard clinch ) or outward ( pinning ) fashion . If your staples are forming outward , this means that the anvil has been turned . To resolve , push the button under your anvil upward . This will raise the anvil , now rotate the anvil 180 degrees . This will change the position of the forming slots.Pinning ( the staple legs are formed outward ) is an old style of securing papers . You would be able to remove the staple without damaging your papers , and add additional papers . One draw-back to this style of fastening is that the staple leg is exposed and will catch on other objects .",0

why do clouds sometimes look like cotton ? The whiteness of clouds is due to the tiny particles of water that make them up refracting the sunlight that enters them to make it appear brighter as it comes out .

"Is there anyone who is an active `` swinger '' or who has advice on the subject ? I do n't know how I would feel sharing my wife with another guy , however , I would love to involve her in swinging . if you are an active swinger or just like sex , please reply . If you want to do this with her , lay out the ground rules in advance , get involved in a local swinger 's group , and realize that if she enjoys sex with somebody else , the odds of her leaving you are much , much higher if you swing because you are allowing her to 'shop around ' , so to speak . Most likely you want to do this so you can have sex with other women and are n't thinking about how jealous you could be if you see your wife enjoying sex with somebody else instead of you . She might also realize how unsatisfied she is by you and your marriage will suffer , especially when the other guy is much more experienced with pleasuring a woman and gives her orgasm after orgasm . Your odds of picking up various STDs will also increase . Remember that a condom will not protect against all of them , such as genital warts , and you could both end up unlucky recipients of STDs that you 'll carry the rest of your lives .

"can wood be liquified ? well , it depends on what you mean by `` liquefied '' . most certainly it can be ground or sanded into a fine dust ( sawdust ) and then mixed with water - voila , liquified wood.on the other hand , if you mean melted , the way you melt ice or iron.. not really , no . wood is a pretty complex substance , with lots of different kinds of chemicals arranged into cells . chemically speaking , it 's mostly carbon and water , and trace amounts of a bazillion other chemicals . if you heat it up , some other chemical reactions will happen first ( combustion , for instance , in the presence of oxygen ) . in the absence of oxygen , you make charcoal if you heat wood to around 300C - the water evaporates away , the bonds break and all the other chemicals are driven out . what 's left is a chunk of solid , mostly ( 90 % ) carbon in noncrystalline or `` amorphous '' form . if you KEEP heating it , always without any oxygen because it 'll burn otherwise - eventually this stuff will melt , but solid carbon melts at around 3800C , which is getting pretty close to the temperature of the surface of the sun . so it 's pretty difficult to do , though if you increase the pressure , the melting temperature will go down - this is how they make synthetic diamonds.otherwise , wood can be `` liquefied '' through other chemical processes , such as decomposition/rotting - this is where oil comes from - but by the time it 's liquid , it hardly qualifies as wood anymore.so , i guess the short answer to the question is no , it ca n't be .",0

In some cases , the term is also used with a presumption of human causation , including in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) .

"while visiting Appomattox I noticed that the grave markers were covered with coins . What is the reason for thi There are many theories why people place coins and other `` offerings '' on headstones . I have seen this at many historic sites , Calvin Coolidge grave etc.1 . Some say money left at graveside goes back to the coins left at graves in ancient Greece to pay Charon , for ferry passage over the River Styx to Hades.2 . It is a widespread custom to leave a small remembrance as a sign of respect in many cultures.3 . It may be a secular version of the Jewish tradition of putting a pebble on the gravestone to show remembrance and respect.In `` The Jewish Home : a guide for Jewish living : by Daniel B. Syme it says the following : > > '' In biblical times , ... graves were sometimes marked by a pile of stones . Some scholars suggest that this may explain the custom of leaving pebbles . There is no religious basis for the practice . It serves to indicate that loved ones have been to the grave , and that alone is sufficient cause to justify it . At least one contemporary rabbi , however , has suggested that leaving a stone may also have therapeutic benefit for us , especially if we see it as a symbolic means of leaving behind some of the 'hardness ' of grief and pain .

"How can you connect one printer to two computers at the same time ? Hi how can I connect my printer to both of my computers where it will print from either one without me having to unplug it and set ip up everytime on the computer I wish to print . That would depend on what kind of connector ( s ) your printer has : if it has a parallel/Centronics connector , there are parallel switches which would do the trick . If it has a network/Ethernet connection , a router or hub or switch ( depending on your network setup ) would be the easiest - if you have one of those three already , you would connect the printers network cable to the router or hub or switch and then should be able to set it up on both computers through Windows printer sharing . If it has a USB connector , I 'm not sure if you can share a printer through a USB hub , but there are USB-to-Ethernet adapters that might also work in conjunction with a router or hub or switch .",0

"gay marriage ? Earlier today I read answers to a question that went something like `` if you had only a month to live what would you do ? '' One of the responses was from a gay man who referred to ( among other things ) making sure his accounts etc . were set up so that his `` husband '' had financial security after his death . It is obvious that , although he loves his partner dearly and considers him his husband , he does not enjoy the same rights and privileges that heterosexual married couples take for granted.I would like to hear from gay couples detailing the disadvantages they face due to not being allowed a legal marriage . ( personal experiences only , please - I can do a google search and find the HRC website on my own ) When I got sick and my husband took me to the emergency room , I had to state that I wanted him to go with me because he is not 'family ' and we are not married . I had to state over and over that I wanted him in the room each time a nurse would enter and have something they needed to do . We found out when getting car insurance for both of our cars that if we were married we would get a discount , but because we are not and because our State does not recognize our union , we could not receive those discounts.At work when filing out my medical insurance information ... part of the benefits of my job ... I was not allowed to list my husband as a beneficiary because the term 'spouse ' is defined as being someone of the opposite gender whom you are married to . Had we any children I was informed that I might not have been able to include them either since the State I reside in only allows for one person in a same-sex union to adopt , the other person is n't allowed to adopt that child . When listing whom I wanted as the beneficiary of the life insurance , I could not list my husband with the same benefits a married couple would receive . He would receive much less if I died than he would have if he had been married to a woman . That was upsetting.My husband is Native American . In his tribe while they do not have any laws stating that same-sex marriage is illegal , when he inquired he was told that it is against traditions and that there is no way two people of the same-sex could be recognized in the tribe as a married couple . When asked about adopting children , he was told that adopted children are not considered a part of the tribe and can not participate in tribal activities . When asked if he had a child , surogate , with a woman that was biologically his and adopted by me if the child could still participate in tribal activities he was told that the child could not because it did not reside in a heterosexual married union ... and that also because I am not part of the tribe.We have talked with lawyers about all the legal things we can do . It would all costs far more money than we have , would require a great deal of court time , and even then there is no guarantee that the courts would honor our requests nor is their a guarantee that the legal documents would be honored by our families ( who could dispute them ) . Perhaps the one thing that bothers me most is n't so much all the legal aspects , it 's that people do n't take seriously our commitment and love for each other . When amongst other people when we refer to each other as husbands there are many people who are quick to remind us that we are n't really husbands ( from heteros and homos both ) . It is n't unusual for people to say things about our relationship that they 'd never say to or about a married couple . There is a big disrespect towards us done each time others invalidate and belittle our commitment , our relationship , and our love for each other . That hurts a lot more than the legal issues , but it often underlies the very problems of why such legal issues are n't resolved.And for the record , we are in our mid-twenties , so while many people seem to think that only 'old ' gay people are dealing with these issues ... They 're not .",0
"What type of rocks are usually taken from quarries ? Any type of rock or mineral ore can be quarried if the deposit is close enough to the surface of the earth . Most quarry operations are for limestone and dolomite in the US . The primary product of quarries is what is called 'natural aggregates ' which most people just call gravel . Of the natural aggregates produced in the US , 71 % are limestone and dolomite , 15 % are granite , and 8 % is from gabbro , basalt and diabase . The remaining 6 % is sandstone , quartzite , marble , slate , shell , and volcanic cinder and scoria . These statistics are from the USGS . Coal strip mines and iron and copper open pit mines are generally not called quarries , but are very much the same in that they dig into the earth in open holes to recover minerals .

"how many taste buds do we use when we are tasting our food ? The types are SweetSaltySourBitterUmame ( alluded to above . From the Japanese word for `` savory , '' this responds to meaty tastes , ie high protein , and MSG . MSG is a food additive , Monosodium glutamate -- and glutamate if an amino acid , which are the building blocks for protein ) .And if you want the nitty-gritty , the idea behind taste buds are that various cells detect chemicals , and depending on the region of the brain that the cell is wired to , you know the taste . But not all receptors even of a given type are the same in their mechanism.Sweet reception is more than just a detection of -OH groups . There is a family of transmembrane g-protein coupled receptors called the T1Rs . The various tastes are sensed by various cells , differentiated by the type of receptors expressed in the cell.The sense of sweetness is detected by cells that express a combination of the T1R2 and T1R3 receptors . There is a quality about the sugars that trigger the perception of sweetness such that they bind to one of each of these receptors , creating a heterodimer and trigger the cascade that makes the cell fire . The umami sense is triggered likewise by a coupling of the T1R1 and T1R3 receptors . Some cells are known to express either only T1R2 or only T1R3 , and these have a low affinity detection of sugars ( or perhaps there is a yet unrecognized ligand for these cells ) .Sourness is the result of an acidic pH , with pH being the presence of hydronium ions ( H+ ) at a concentration greater than 10^-7 mole fraction . Sour is detected in sour-sensing cells by H+ ion blocking of the K+ channels , slowing K+ efflux and ultimately depolarizing the cell . Saltiness is detected by Na+ entering the Na+ channels and depolarize the cell.Bitterness is mediated by several distinct receptors that bind to various types of alkaline ( often amine ) molecules , in the T2R family . Bitterness is usually associated with potential toxins , so many receptors detect many things .",0

"Is there a recursive algorithm that generates all the permutations of a given string ? Here 's a java solution that uses recursion . The permute function takes two arguments : a done portion and a todo portion . The basic idea is that each of the characters in the todo portion could be the next character . So , at each step , n recursive calls are made , where n is the length of todo . Each call chooses a different character as the next character to go into the done portion . So , the first time the number of recursive calls will equal the number of characters in the initial string . Each of these calls will make further recursive calls equal to the number of characters in the initial string minus one . And so on . Thus , the number of solutions will be n ! = n*n-1*n-2* ... *1 , where n is the number of characters in the initial string.The program below was tested with java 's sun compiler 1.4.2.public class perm { public perm ( String S ) { permute ( `` '' , S ) ; } public void permute ( String done , String todo ) { if ( ( todo.length ( ) ==0 ) || ( todo.equals ( `` '' ) ) ) System.out.println ( done ) ; else { for ( int i=0 ; i < todo.length ( ) ; i++ ) { String c = todo.substring ( 0,1 ) ; todo = todo.substring ( 1 ) ; permute ( done+c , todo ) ; todo = todo + c ; } } } public static void main ( String args [ ] ) { if ( ( args.length==0 ) || ( args [ 0 ] .length ( ) ==0 ) || ( args [ 0 ] .equals ( `` '' ) ) ) return ; perm p = new perm ( args [ 0 ] ) ; } }",0

"I need to know the physics behind a helicopter 's flight. ? I need to know how a helicopter flies ( with equations , if possible ) and the possible problems a helicopter may experience in-flight . Thanks . Well , the physics of a helicopter is a very complex subject , but in essence it is only the blades of the helicopter pushing air down on the ground to lift it . The reason it starts to become complex is because the weight of the helicopter is thrown into the equation and the blades of it work in circular motion . The helicopter does have a coefficient of friction against it , which does not help the simplicity . The blades are angled to enhance the lift momentum . they´re 3 types of blades for helicopters and planes : BLADES WITH NO ANGLE ATACK , WITH SLIGHT ANGLE ATACK AND WITH STEP ANGLE ATACK.Also the blades spin in one direction , forcing the helicopter to actually spin in the other direction : Without the rear blade the helicopter would just spin due to Newton 's third law and action-reaction forces . The third law states that `` when one object exerts a force on a second object , the second exerts a force on the first that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction '' Action-Reaction forces means that for every force that the blades exerts , the body of the helicopter will spin proportional.The Rotor , blades in the rear , keep the helicopter going straight . They always oppose the force made by the blades.IN THE SOURCE PAGE I GAVE YOU YOU´LL FIND ALL THE EQUATIONS AND ANSWERS YOU NEED ABOUT THIS TOPIC .",0
"what are the characteristics of fluorine ? - > Pure fluorine ( F2 ) is a corrosive pale yellow gas that is a powerful oxidizing agent . - > It is the most reactive and electronegative of all the elements , and readily forms compounds with most other elements .

Even in dark , cool conditions , fluorine reacts explosively with hydrogen . - > It is so reactive that glass , metals , and even water , as well as other substances , burn with a bright flame in a jet of fluorine gas . - > It is far too reactive to be found in elemental form and has such an affinity for most elements , including silicon , that it can neither be prepared nor should be kept in glass vessels . In moist air it reacts with water to form the equally dangerous hydrofluoric acid.- > In aqueous solution , fluorine commonly occurs as the fluoride ion F- .

An 'essential fatty acid ' is a type of fatty acid needed by our bodies which needs to be supplemented in our diets as we are incapable of producing it ourselves . Since most of us eat hugely insufficient amounts of such fatty acids , most of us are deficient in it . So adding it to our diets usually fulfils the immediate need for them and makes a big difference . Fatty fish are excellent sources of Omega-3 , but there is some concern about increased levels of heavy metal contaminants in their meat ... so i think it is best and more convenient to supplement your diet with processed fish oils ... which have been purified . Cod liver oil capsules are a popular and easily available fish oil supplement , however are very rich in Vitamin A . Perhaps the best choice left is to consider Fish Body Oil instead of fish liver oil ... if you can get your hands on those . Do consider it ... it 'll really help you out ... .. if you decide on taking cod liver oil ... take no more than one capsule every 3 or 4 days ... just to be on the safe side . Fish body oils can be safely taken every other day .",0

"How frequently do I use grunt and anteler calls while deer hunting in the rut ? It all depends on where you are hunting and what the buck to doe ratio is . If you are hunting on public property and the buck to doe ratio is 1/5 or worse you will want to be very timid with your calling . For one there is not much competition for does so the fighting does not occur as much and for two if you are on a heavily hunted area and other people are calling wrong or overcalling all they are doing is educating the deer and they will not respond as well to the calling . If you are hunting on private property or in an area where the buck to doe ratio is 1/3 or better the rules will change . You can be more aggressive and make more mistakes and they will not be as costly . I was watching the outdoor channel the other day ( ca n't remember wich program ) but this guy in texas was rattling and grunting constantly , I could n't believe how aggressive he was being and how constant he was doing it , but it was working very effectively . The ranch he was hunting though only allowed the taking of 2-3 deer a year though and the buck to doe ratio was 1/2 . One last comment is that i believe the pre-rut all the way to when the does are just starting to go in to estruess is the best time to grunt and rattle",0

"Why does n't the Jewish religion believe in Jesus if he was a Jew ? Maybe this is all ignorance on my part . I do n't know . I really want to know . Truly and honestly , I 'm just trying to educate myself further . Any explanations are greatly appreciated . PLEASE look at the following : :http : //WhatJewsBelieve.orghttp : //Convert.org The basic beliefs of Christianity about Jesus are against what the Bible says , and so Real Jews can not believe in Jesus at all.The Christian understanding is that the Messiah , Jesus , died for the sins of the people . The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin.But we are taught in our Torah that no one can die for the sins of another . In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death forthe fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin ( eesh b ’ chet-o yumatu ) .In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself to atone for the sins of the people . To be written out of Gd 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . Gd 's response is No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : Exodus 32:30-35 And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Etrnl ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Etrnl , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Etrnl said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book . The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for Gd 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd will forgive us.So , the Bible is clear , no one can die for the sins of another , and this means that Jesus can not die for anyone else 's sins.Christians also believe that one needs a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin , that one who does not have such a blood sacrifice will die in their sins , and go to hell , except for the sacrifice of Jesus.This , too , is UnBiblical . The Bible describes blood sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin in the Book of Leviticus . But it is in Leviticus itself , in the middle of the discussion of the sin sacrifices , that we are taught that we do not need a blood sacrifice to be forgiven for our sins . Offering a blood sacrifice was an expensive thing to do for the family offering the animal . Was forgiveness then , to be only for the rich ? No , because if one could not afford a blood sacrifice then one who sins could bring flour , which has no blood and no life as their sacrifice , and Gd forgave them ! Leviticus 5:11-13 ; But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering ; he shall put no oil upon it , neither shall he put any frankincense thereon : for it is a sin offering.Furthermore , read the Book of Jonah . In Jonah , the People of Ninevah do three things in order to be forgiven by Gd . They fast , they pray for forgiveness , and they stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgave them ! This is exactly what we do on Yom Kippur , we fast , we pray for forgiveness , and , hopefully , we stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgives us . And what book do we read on Yom Kippur afternoon ? The Book of Jonah ! Jonah 3:7-10 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Ninevah , by the decree of the King and his nobles , saying , Let neither man nor beast , herd nor flock taste anything ; let them not feed nor drink water ; but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto Gd ; yea , let them turn every one from his evil",0

"how can i jump higher so that I can dunk a basketball ? I am a 6 foot 1 Asian basketball player.I want tips to increase my vertical so that I can dunk .

"where natural digits 0123456789 are coming from ? In mathematics , a natural number is either a positive integer ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... ) or a non-negative integer ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... ) . The former definition is generally used in number theory , while the latter is preferred in set theory and computer science.Natural numbers have two main purposes : they can be used for counting ( `` there are 3 apples on the table '' ) , and they can be used for ordering ( `` this is the 3rd largest city in the country '' ) . The natural numbers developed with some difficulty . The Peano postulates state conditions that any successful definition must satisfy . Certain constructions show that , given set theory , models of the Peano postulates must exist.Peano axiomsThere is a natural number 0 . Every natural number a has a natural number successor , denoted by S ( a ) . There is no natural number whose successor is 0 . Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors : if a ≠ b , then S ( a ) ≠ S ( b ) . If a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every natural number which possesses it , then it is possessed by all natural numbers . ( This postulate ensures that the proof technique of mathematical induction is valid . )",0

"What are eyebrows for ? from straigtdope.com : '' The consensus is that eyebrows keep moisture ( sweat , mostly , but also rain ) from running down one 's forehead and straight into the eyes .

There have been one or two comments from people who were , for one reason or another , temporarily without eyebrows who claimed the difference was noticeable . I 've always been content with that explanation .

"whats the difference between distance and gravitational pull ? whats the difference between distance and gravitational pull I think you 're asking about the relationship between distance and gravitational pull.Gravitational pull weakens as the distance increases . The farther you are away from an object , the weaker the gravitational pull will be.We say that gravity is `` inversely proportional '' to distance - meaning as distance increases , gravity decreases , and as distance decreases , gravity increases.More specificially , gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance - meaning that if the distance increases by a factor of 2 , gravity decreases by a factor of 4 , and if the distance increases by a factor of 3 , gravity decreases by a factor of 9 .",0
"Why does the days in the Georgian Calendar differ with the dates every year ? ? The traditional Chinese one isnt The traditional Chinese calendar does not contain “ weeks ” . In ancient China government officials enjoyed a day off for every ten days . The week system was introduced into China , I guess , only in early last century along with the Gregorian calendar . According to the Chinese calendar , a year has 12 months and a month has 29 or 30 days . If a month has 29 days , we call it the lesser month ; if 30 days – the greater month . Each of the 12 months of a certain year can be lesser or greater , depending on the astronomical calculation . There is no special name to each month ; they are identified by the ordinal numbers ( 1 to 12 ) . If you want to know , for example , whether the second month of the next Chinese year ( or lunar year ) is a lesser or greater one , you have to consult an almanac or a perpetual calendar . There is an intercalary month arranged for every three years ( approximately ) . An intercalary year has 13 months . That ’ s the outline of the Chinese calendar . And it may be obvious that the Chinese calendar can not match its dates to the week 's days .",0

"why in dry cell , cathode is marked '+ ' while in car battery anode is marked '+ ' ? Polarity of electricity was specified long ago by Benjamin Frankline before there was a practical means of detecting electrons . He could have tossed a coin to specify + or - . The thought was that electricity would flow ( like water ) from + ( high ) to - ( low ) . Unfortunately it was discovered that electrons actually flow from - to + in an external wire , but it was too late and we live with convention now . In a way it really does n't matter as long as all circuit designers agree on the convention since we can not see electrons ; unless you are designing a vacuum tube ( etc . ) where electrons must physically flow from a heated element that boils them off to a grounded plate that collects them . Cathode is normally the negative pole .",0

"give 1safety precaution should be taken when celestine is heated with carbon in a lab and reason ? Celestine is sometimes used to produce a red color in fireworks .

"Why is the color in a 50 year old movie so much better than in a new movie ? `` better '' is a very subjective term . Technicolor process films allowed for super-saturated colors to be seen in the final print . Currently there is n't any process similar to that in wide use . Technicolor used three strips of black and white film , each exposed through a filter ( red , green , blue ) to capture the original images . Then in a lab , each of the black and white strips were exposed against color film print stock with the same color filter . This process also led to occasional color mis-registration in some films where the lab work was rushed or done sloppily.Most modern films are shot on single-strips of negative with three dye layers of emulsion that are each sensitive to different color wavelengths . ( see the first link below ) A very popular film stock these days is Kodak 's 5279 `` vision 500T '' which has a very high ISO yet does n't get as grainy as previous high ISO films . ( see second link below ) Because films nowadays are shot on single-strip film , super-saturating colors requires post-processing for color-timing , such as digital intermediate processing ( see link 3 below for Discreet 's DI product info . ) Directors also like to have a lot of creative control over the look and feel of a film that is done through the color timing process ( see the 4th link , although the entry is incorrect as Pleasantville was the first film to be completely digitally color-graded in 1998 ) This can include adding hues or increasing or reducing contrast - good examples are in Cinderella Man and Lord of the Rings : ROTK",0

"Are there any plutonium compounds ? Plutonium reacts readily with oxygen , forming PuO and PuO2 , as well as intermediate oxides . It reacts with the halides , giving rise to compounds such as PuX3 where X can be F , Cl , Br or I ; PuF4 is also seen . The following oxyhalides are observed : PuOCl , PuOBr and PuOI . It will react with carbon to form PuC , nitrogen to form PuN and silicon to form PuSi2.Plutonium like other actinides readily forms a dioxide plutonyl core ( PuO2 ) . In the environment , this plutonyl core readily complexes with carbonate as well as other oxygen moeities ( OH- , NO2- , NO3- , and SO4-2 ) to form charged complexes which can be readily mobile with low affinities to soil . * PuO2 ( CO3 ) 1-2 * PuO2 ( CO3 ) 2-4 * PuO2 ( CO3 ) 3-6PuO2 formed from neutralizing highly acidic nitric acid solutions tends to form polymeric PuO2 which is resistant to complexation .

"why gals have boobs ? Well… “ gals , ” ( as you call them ) have breast mainly for two reasons:1 ) They are necessary to provide nourishment to their offspring ( children ) just as all other female animals in nature do . Before the invention and convenience of bottles and breast formula , breast milk was the only possible food for newborns to consume . The child 's body structure was not yet developed enough for the breakdown and distribution of vitamins , minerals , etc from solid food yet , so breast milk provided them with the needed nutrients from what the mother was eating to develop properly.2 ) The other reason coincides with the first . Females have breast as an aesthetically attractive feature to attract males . In the natural process of things , females are the force behind our survival , ( as a human race ) , and just like all other animals , they have inborn “ assets ” ( trying to be tactful here ) that assist them in acquiring a mating partner .",0

"pls give at least thing that the sun can do to all living things . and what is the importance of sunlight ? The sun provides energy to living organisms of the Earth . There are autrophs and heterotrophs . Autotrophs ( like plants ) use sunlight to turn CO2 and Water , which can not be further oxidized as fuel into GLucose , which can be burned by a cell as a source of fuel . Low rung food chain heterotrophs eat autotrophs ( these are herbivores ) and get their calories ( food is a source of chemical potential energy ) from the glucose ( and some other chemicals ) made by autotrophs . Higher level heterotrophs eat the lower level heterotrophs , getting their calories from proteins and fats of the herbivores they are eating . The calories contained in the proteins and fats of the herbivores is derived from the calories of the autotrophs . In essence , the calories from food on this planet are derived from energy from sunlight that plants have converted to chemical form .",0

Why ca n't the telemarketer hear me say `` Hello '' when I answer the phone ? Everytime a telemarketer calls I say `` Hello . '' Then it takes a few seconds and they say `` Hello ? '' As if they are wondering if anyone answered . Why is this the case ? Telemarketers do not actually dial the phone calls . They sit at a desk and wait to be alerted that they are being connected to a call through their call system . It would be a waste of time for telemarketers to wait on the line for someone to answer the phone because there could be no answer or they could get your voicemail . Your voice actually triggers the connection . They do not hear you say hello because they have not been connected to you yet .,0

"I have a Buddhist question : are there any Buddhist solar adorations ? What are they ? I am certainly aware that there are `` solar '' aspects to all of the great spiritual teachings . For example , the Bible speaks of `` the Sun of Righteousness '' in Malachi & of a Davidic solar vision in Psalms 19 . The Hindu Gayatri mantra is solar ( a SPIRITUAL , internal Sun , not the one in the sky - this also has to do w/the passage of the seasons , marking time ) . The ancient Egyptians were certainly into our shining orb , not sure about Islam yet.My question is , what is the Buddhist contribution ? I know they believe that all spiritual entities are mere forms of `` Buddha consciousness '' , a primordial essence beyond time & space that is STILL not a `` God '' - that 's another form ! I ca n't find this on any of the Buddhist links I 've checked . Sorry for asking something so hard . The phrase Sun of Enlightenment is one ( see reference below ) . Look up references to the Sun-faced Buddha . This is another solar reference.Unlike many religions which attempted to swallow pagan worshippers , Buddhism accepted no outside dogma or symbols except as they enhanced the concept of the Path to Enlightenment . Many in the West have a very hard time understanding what this means .",0
"What is the right age to get married ? Age is n't as important as maturity and so many other factors , like life goals , and personality compatibility . We all are at some stage in life . A great marriage is one in which both parties are of pretty much equal places in maturity , experience , wisdom , ect . they want their lives to go the same place at the same speed , understand and happily accept the self sacrifice it takes to get there . Differences make for exciting mates and excitement in dating is a good thing but they make for an unhappy marriage in the long haul . In other words , who you prefer to date might be the exact opposite of who you should marry and as you mature , you 'll know the difference between the two.As it is , this is nothing but my opinion gleemed from life experience .

"What is the difference between these terms - Taxonomy , Systematics & Classification ? Are they interchangable ? These are closely related terms that refer to different things . Taxonomy is a biological discipline that studies the theory and practice of classification . It 's more about the rules and techniques used to classify living things.Classification is any grouping of things according to arbitrary categories or attributes . Biological classifications , however , aim at establishing natural groups ( i.e. , groups that reflect the genealogy or descent of the organisms ) .Systematics is sometimes used with the same meaning as taxonomy , but it is a broader concept that comprises the scientific study of the types and diversity of organisms and their interelationships ; other definitions are `` the science of biological classification '' or `` the science of organismal diversity '' .",0

"why are banks for coins called piggy banks ? In Middle English , `` pygg '' referred to a type of clay used for making various household objects such as jars . People often saved money in kitchen pots and jars made of pygg , called `` pygg jars '' . By the 18th Century , the spelling of `` pygg '' had changed and the term `` pygg jar '' had evolved to `` pig bank . '' This name may have caught on because the pig banks were mostly used by children , and the pig is a child-friendly shape that is easy to fashion out of clay . The actual origin of the name bears no relation to the pig itself.What also helped to start the change from jar to pig was during the 18th century , an order of 200 `` pygg '' jars was sent for by a shop owner . The person on the receiving end of this letter did not understand and hand crafted 200 coin holders that were shaped like pigs . When this order was received they were shelved and sold very quickly . The new pig shaped coin holder became popular . Once the shop had run out of stock , they sent off for more pig-shaped coin holders .",0

Once you enable encryption on your router you then need to configure you laptop/pc 's wireless connection to match the ssid and wep key . Once that is done then your connection should work just fine . Wep is n't the best security but it is a start . If you are going to use it then I would use 128bit and disable broadcast ssid . As for configuring your laptop/pc it depends on if you are using an application or depending on windows to control the wireless card . An external card could be using an application . If it is an internal built in card then more than likely it is being controlled by windows . You can go to your network connections and verify .

"does lifting weights during basketball season affect your shot at all ? my shot has been off recently and one of my friends thought it might be form lifting weights so i thought id check it out . Unfortunately , the buffing up does affect your shot . This is because the added muscle mass if you try to go up in amount of weight will cause the power you put behind your shot to increase . You should always lift in the off-season , and keep a consistent lower amount to lift to maintain tone during the season . Say go up 5 lbs . a week before season and stay 15 lbs under your max through the season to stay tone . Also , do n't lift everyday , let muscles relax so they can stay healthy , they are anerobic .",0

"HOw do El Ninos warm water 's affect the weather. ? needs to be at least 80 words long okay , now that enough time has gone by to keep you from just copying this onto your homework : ( at least that 's what I read in when you say ..needs to be 80 words.. ) I quote : '' Because El Niño 's warm pool feeds thunderstorms above , it creates increased rainfall across the east-central and eastern Pacific Ocean.In South America , the effects of El Niño are direct and stronger than in North America . An El Niño is associated with warm and very wet summers ( December-February ) along the coasts of northern Peru and Ecuador , causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme . The effects during the months of February , March and April may become critical . Southern Brazil and northern Argentina also experience wetter than normal conditions but mainly during the spring and early summer . Central Chile receives a mild winter with large rainfall , and the Peruvian-Bolivian Altiplano is sometimes exposed to unusual winter snowfall events . Drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the Amazon River Basin , Colombia and Central America.Direct effects of El Niño resulting in drier conditions occur in Indonesia , increasing forest fires , in the Philippines , and northern Australia . Drier than normal conditions are also generally observed in Queensland , inland Victoria , inland New South Wales and eastern Tasmania during June-August.West of the Antarctic Peninsula , the Ross , Bellingshausen , and Amundsen Sea sectors have more sea ice during El Niño . The latter two and the Weddell Sea also become warmer and have higher atmospheric pressure.In North America , typically , winters are warmer than normal in the upper Midwest states and Canada , while central and southern California , northwest Mexico and the southeastern U.S. , are wetter than normal . Summer is wetter in the intermountain regions of the U.S . The Pacific Northwest states , on the other hand , tend to be drier during an El Niño . During a La Niña , by contrast , the Midwestern U.S. tends to be drier than normal . El Niño is also associated with decreased hurricane activity in the Atlantic.Finally , East Africa , including Kenya , Tanzania and the White Nile basin , experiences in the long rains from March to May wetter than normal conditions . There also are drier than normal conditions from December to February in south-central Africa , mainly in Zambia , Zimbabwe , Mozambique and Botswana '' source : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_nino",0

"Why does carbon form so many compounds ? There are lots of reasons why there are large number of organic compounds .I ’ m giving U few of them.Catenation : The tendency of an element to form chains of identical atoms is called catenation . This tendency is observed in the case of non-metals showing covalency of two or more . However , this property is maximum in carbon as it can combine with other carbon atoms by single , double or triple covalent bonds . The bonding can be extended to form long open chain ( straight or branched ) or closed ones . Catenation property depends upon the value of bond energy which is maximum in the case of carbon . Bond : C-C Si-Si S-S P-P N-N O-OBond energy : 83 54 54 50 39 35 ( approximately ) ( kcal/mol ) The stability or the strength of the bond decreases as the bond energy decreases . Hence , the tendency of catenation decreases in the following manner ; C > Si ~ S > P > N > OTendency to combine with other non-metals : Carbon has the ability to form strong covalent bonds with many other atoms such as H , O , S , N , Cl , Br , I , etc . The C-C bond energy is approximately equals to the magnitude of bond energies between carbon and various other atoms.Bond C-C C-H C-O C-Cl C-N C-BrBond energy 83.0 97.0 86.0 81.0 73.0 68.0 ( approximately ) ( kcal/mol ) Isomerism is one of the reason also .",0

"What is better NonCommissioned Officers or Commissioned Officers ? ( follow-up question.. ) It all depends on what you mean by `` better . '' The officer corps are the managers of the military and are granted that rank by the President ( at least indirectly ) . Usually they are better educated , normally requiring a college degree . Have completed some sort of military training such as Officer Candidate School , the Military Academy or ROTC . This is followed by several months , typically , of training in their branch of service . The pay for officers and the breadth of their responsibilities are normally greater than those of NCOs.If the officers are the brains of the military , NCOs are the backbone . They are more specialized in their jobs and typically have less overall responsibility . However , they have worked up through the ranks and know how things work . For this reason , they supervise soldiers on a day-to-day basis to ensure objectives of 'management ' are met . They will typically have more experience than the newly commissioned lieutenant and the wise officer will solicit their input . Personally , I had more fun and a lot less politics as an NCO.Another category , between NCO and Officer , is Warrant Officer . This is a highly specialized individual normally with expert technical skills but lacking a normal commission . Examples may include some pilots . I have n't been one of these , but that seems the way to go ; - )",0

Sure Chicago and Moulin Rouge were HUGE . But since then , the musical movies have n't done as well in the box office . I think movies ( as many things ) in general go through cycles . Action movies are really popular , sci-fi really popular , musical movies are really popular , etc . I think in a couple of years musical movies will become big again . Until then , I think production companies will think hard about putting musicals up and into production .",0
"Whats a girl to do ? I have just split up with my boyfriend more or less because of outside source/reasons.. and we agreeed that time apart would be best for right now . There have been other situations that we have gone through and taken a break and I would always be the one to call.. but this time I just felt as though I didnt need to call and to wait for him to call . SO , he called last night and we talked and he offered to go somewhere with me tomorrow and help me out with something and I was kinda hesitatant at first so he took it as me not wanting to . Which was fine with me , i just didnt want him to feel bad . The only reason I was hesitant was becase I didnt know if I was ready to see him yet . SO I called today and explained that to him . explained that I was only hesitant because I didnt know if I was ready to see hmi , but after our coversation I realized it would be fine to see him . Should I have just left it as it was , or the fact i called and explained myself ok ? Did I just make myelf too available ? If you like him and enjoy hanging out with him then talk with him and hang out . Guys are hard to understand and confusing . Just be honest and mature . Talk about how you are feeling and explain what you mean so he does n't take things the wrong way and same goes for you , if he says something that you do n't quite understand let him know . The way I look at things is that if things are meant to happen then they will . Do n't worry , just take it easy . Best of luck to you ! ! : )",0

"Why does a laptop keep shutting down ? Laptop will shut down randomly , sometimes after about 10 minutes of use . Even when it 's plugged in , and battery is fully charged.I 've seen this behavior on an HP Laptop and an IBM Thinkpad T21.Any reference links would be greatly appreciated .

"information about light ? Light , form of electromagnetic radiation similar to radiant heat , radio waves , and X rays . Light consists of extremely fast oscillations of an electromagnetic field in a particular range of frequencies that can be detected by the human eye . Different colour sensations are produced by light vibrating at different frequencies , ranging from about 4 × 1014 vibrations per second for red light to about 7.5 × 1014 vibrations per second for violet light . The visible spectrum of light is usually defined by its wavelength , ranging from the smallest visible wavelength for violet , about 40 millionths of a centimetre ( 16 millionths of an inch ) , to 75 millionths of a centimetre ( about 30 millionths of an inch ) for red . Higher frequencies , corresponding to shorter wavelengths , comprise ultraviolet radiation , and still higher frequencies are associated with X-rays . Lower frequencies , which are at longer wavelengths , are called infrared radiation , and still lower frequencies are characteristic of radio waves . Most light comes from electrons that vibrate at these high frequencies when heated to a high temperature . The higher the temperature , the greater the frequency of vibration and the bluer the light produced.Light is emitted from a source in straight lines and spreads out over a larger and larger area as it travels ; the light per unit area diminishes as the square of the distance . When light strikes an object , it is either absorbed or reflected ; light reflected from a rough surface is scattered in all directions . Some frequencies are reflected more strongly than others , and this gives objects their characteristic colour . White surfaces scatter light of all wavelengths equally , and black surfaces absorb nearly all light . Image-forming reflection , on the other hand , requires a highly polished surface such as that of a mirror.Defining the nature of light has always been a fundamental problem in physics . The English mathematician and physicist Sir Isaac Newton described light as an emission of particles , and the Dutch astronomer , mathematician , and physicist Christiaan Huygens developed the theory that light travels by a wave motion.It is now believed that these two theories are essentially complementary , and the development of quantum theory has led to the recognition that in some experiments light acts like a series of particles and in other experiments it acts like a wave . In those situations in which it travels in wave motion , the wave vibrates at right angles to the direction of travel ; therefore light can be polarized in two mutually perpendicular planes ( see Optics ) .III VELOCITY The speed of light was first measured in a laboratory experiment by the French physicist Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau , although earlier astronomical observations had yielded approximately the right velocity . By the 1970s the speed of light had been measured very precisely as 299,792,458 m/sec ( 186,282.397 mi/sec ) in a vacuum , and could be used to measure large distances by the time it took for a pulse of light or radio waves to reach a target and return . This is the principle of radar and sonar . Accurate knowledge of the speed and the wavelength of light also permits accurate measurement of length . In fact , in 1983 the metre was redefined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second . The velocity of light in air varies slightly with wavelength , averaging about 3 per cent less than in vacuum ; the speed in water is about 25 per cent less , and in glass , 33 per cent less.Light has an important effect on many chemicals . Sunlight , for example , is used by plants to carry out photosynthesis , and the exposure of certain silver-containing chemicals to light causes them to turn dark in the presence of other chemicals , as is the case in photography .",0

"Why does milke spoil ? help ! Because after milk is extracted , it is then cooled in the dairy and transported in refrigerated tankers for processing . Unchilled milk would soon go sour due to acid production by lactobacilli . Even if kept refrigerated , raw milk goes off rapidly due to the action of psychrophilic ( cold-tolerant ) bacteria . These produce proteinases and lipases which break down both the protein and the fat in milk , causing rancid and bitter tastes and clotting . One unusual type of bacteria which can grow is called Alcaligenes viscolactis – this produces sticky threads of exopolysaccharide in the milk called ropiness . : ) Peace",0

"How should the nuclear standoff with Iran be resolved ? I do n't understand . US suggests they want to attack Israel .

Iran says they want nuclear power , to be a developed country . But it 's not necessary to have nuclear power to develop . Many European countries or the neighbour Arab Emirats , are more than developed wihtout nuclear power . A military strike would be the worse option . If they want to have nuclear power or even nukes , they should , like many other countries , even with dictators do .

"I am with the man of my dreams ... . and it seems his ex ? I moved in with him about a year ago , I have known and loved him for what seems 4ever . Left my husband of many years to be with him . He is sweet , caring , loving , but failed to mention an ex that is now a part of everyday life . They see each other , talk on the phone , help each other , and she is about the nicest person I 've met in years . They both insist it is just a friendship , that they just enjoy similar interests and each others company . They have on many occasions invited me to join them when they get together , he has on many occasions NOT invited me and been gone for hours only to return saying he did nothing wrong , and I should n't worry , she 's just a friend . I know he is still in love with her , I do n't know of her true feelings , or intentions for that matter . She has told me it is important for me and this man to work because she wants him to be happy . He kept the `` friendship '' secret from me for months saying he was sparing my feelings ? I do n't know who or what to trust ? I lovehim Wow , tough problem . I think what I 'd do is have a heart to heart with the girlfriend . Maybe she really does want him to be happy with you and maybe it 's him that 's holding out hope for a renewed relationship with her . If that 's the case , she 'll need to back off , but you need to find out if that 's really the way it is or not first . Good luck . I feel for you .",0

"any lawers in here ? My husband had lukemia when he was little . His father worked at a papermill . I have done research on the papermill and they do have benzene products . I know that it is possible for benzene to cling to clothing and induce lukemia . The problem is his lukemia has been gone for 20+ years and the statute of limitations apply . He has not been in for a check up nor has he ask a health professional if this could be possible . If he gets documentation stateing that it was indeed possible that the exposure may have caused his lukemia , could we sue for `` delayed discovery ? '' Sometimes the accrual of a cause of action in tort is delayed until the plaintiff discovered ( or reasonably should have discovered or suspected ) the factual basis for his or her claim . The discovery rule most frequently applies when it is particularly difficult for the plaintiff to observe or understand the breach of duty , or when the injury itself ( or its cause ) is hidden or beyond what the ordinary person could be expected to understand.Unfortunately , you did not specify where you live . Statutes and case law vary by , so there may literally be 50 different ways to answer your question . There might even be federal laws that apply . Your best bet is to consult a local attorney familar with tort law and get more specific advice .",0
"This is question for science lovers ? If you dig a hole right through the earth along its diameter & drop a ball in the hole , what will be the motion shown by the ball ? This could not be done on earth because of its liquid core , but perhaps it could be done on the solid moon.At the surface of the earth , a ball ( let 's say of lead ) would have a potential energy ( PE - energy of position ) relative to the center of gravity at the center of the earth . As the ball is released into the theoretical hole , it would accelerate ( like dropping it into a well ) and some of the PE would be converted to kinetic energy ( KE - energy of motion ) . Because energy can neither be created nor destroyed , as the ball drops its speed increases and it has more KE but less PE . The ball will continue to accelerate until it reaches the center of the earth but with less attraction from the earth 's gravitational field because more and more of the earth 's mass is now above ( or behind ) it . At the very center of the earth the ball would have maximum KE but minimum PE . Passing the center the process is reversed and the ball slows as it reaches the other side of the earth 's surface , all the while reconverting KE to PE . At the opposite surface the ball would have maximum PE ( equal to the original PE but of opposite sign ( say - instead of + ) .The process could repeat forever if there is no wind resistance ( perfect vacuum - like on the moon ) and the hole was perfectly smooth exerting no friction as the earth spins on its axis constantly touching the ball to the sides of the hole.Of course this must be a mental exercise ; but it is an interesting demonstration of physics and energy conversion in particular . Good luck .",0

"Do any Jews live the Old Testament Laws ? Is there a 12 day period ever month of no sex for husband and wife. ? That is for wives that are pre-menopause . First , we dont call out Bible the 'Old Testament ' because we dont believe there is a new one.However , yes , the Orthodox Jewish community still follows the laws you describe above.By the way , this means that for roughly 2 weeks each month , a Jewish couple who follow this law will not have sex as an issue between them . It means that for half of each month , they must relate to each other as platonic friends , and this makes the relationship far stronger , and is one reason given for the very low divorce rate throughout the history of the Jewish People . Only since the Jews have assimilated , become like their non-Jewish neighbors , has the divorce rate risen to the same rate as among their non-Jewish counterparts , but continues to remain low among the orthodox .",0

The 45KVA is for 230 for 110 volts you would need half of the 45KVA or 22.5KVAAt least that is the way it calculated for me using those tools.So pretty much you need a generator that can deliver 150 amps .

"what is the begining of israel and palastine conflict ? why could n't it be stopped ? Complex problems usually do n't have simple answers ( like 'they tried to throw the Palestinians out ) .For over 3,000 years , Jews have held the Land of Israel to be their homeland , both as a Holy Land and as a Promised Land . The Land of Israel holds a special place in Jewish religious obligations , encompassing Judaism 's most important sites — including the remains of the First and Second Temple , as well as the rites concerning those temples . [ 2 ] Starting around 1200 BCE , a series of Jewish kingdoms and states existed intermittently in the region for over a millennium . Recent archeological evidence suggests that the kingdoms of King David and King Solomon may have existed . [ 3 ] Under Babylonian , Greek , Roman , Byzantine , and ( briefly ) Sassanian rule , Jewish presence in the province dwindled due to mass expulsions . In particular , the failure of the Bar Kochba Revolt against the Roman Empire resulted in widescale expulsion of Jews . It was during this time that the Romans gave the name Syria Palaestina to the geographic area , in an attempt to erase Jewish ties to the land . The Mishnah and Jerusalem Talmud , two of Judaism 's most important religious texts , were composed in the region during this period . The Arabs conquered the land from the Eastern Roman Empire in 638 CE . The area was ruled by various Arab states ( interrupted by the rule of the Crusaders ) before becoming part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517.Throughout the centuries , the size of the Jewish population in the land fluctuated widely . Circa 1881 , in the region approximating present-day Israel , the Jewish population numbered approximately 20–25,000 of a total population of 470,000 . [ citation needed ] Since 1844 , in Jerusalem the Jews have constituted the largest of several ethno-religious groups . [ citation needed ] By 1896 , they were an absolute majority of the populationThe rise of Nazism in 1933 led to a fifth wave of Aliyah . The Jews in the region increased from 11 % of the population in 1922 to 30 % by 1940 . The subsequent Holocaust in Europe led to additional immigration from other parts of Europe . By the end of World War II , the number of Jews in Palestine was approximately 600,000.In 1939 , the British abandoned the idea of a Jewish national home , and abandoned partition and negotiations in favour of the White Paper of 1939 , which limited Jewish immigration and restricted purchase of land by Jews . Its other stated policy was to establish a system under which both Jews and Arabs were to share one government . The plan was never fully implemented because of a combination of resistance from the Jews and Arabs and Britain 's pre-occupation with Europe and World War II . However , the White Paper guided British policy until the end of the term of their Mandate . As a result , many Jews fleeing to Palestine to avoid Nazi persecution and the holocaust were intercepted and returned to Europe . Two specific examples of this policy involved the ships Struma and Exodus [ 4 ] . These attempts by Jews to circumvent the blockade and flee Europe became known as Aliya Beth.In 1947 , following increasing levels of violence by militant groups together with unsuccessful efforts to reconcile the Jewish and Arab populations , the British government decided to withdraw from the Palestine Mandate . The UN General Assembly approved the 1947 UN Partition Plan dividing the territory into two states , Jewish and Arab , giving about half the land area to each state . Jerusalem was planned to be an international region administered by the UN to avoid conflict over its status.Immediately following the adoption of the Partition Plan by the UN General Assembly ( on November 29 , 1947 ) , the Arab leadership rejected the plan and launched a guerilla war that included attacks on Jewish civilians . The Irgun Tsvai Leumi retaliated with attacks on Arabs , including Arab civilians.On May 14 , 1948 , before the expiry of the British Mandate of Palestine at midnight of May 15 , 1948 ,",0

Brushing the ice makes it melt which allows the stone to travel farther . However , if you are wanting to make the stone curl , you wait for the stone to slightly sway in the direction you want then brush hard to keep the stone curling in that direction . This is what allows a team to play their stone behind a guard stone to protect its position on the ice . Hope this helps .",0

"can someone explain the cell cycle to me in english please ... . ? my bio teacher makes no sense at alll ... . The cell cycle , or cell division cycle , is the cycle of events in a eukaryotic cell from one cell division to the next . It consists of interphase , mitosis , and usually cell division . The cell cycle is regulated by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases . Leland H. Hartwell , R. Timothy Hunt , and Paul M. Nurse won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of these central molecules in the regulation of the cell cycle.The phases of the cell cycle are : The G0 phase is a period in the cell cycle where cells exist in a quiescent state . The G1 phase is the first growth phase . S phase , during which the DNA is replicated , where S stands for the Synthesis of DNA . G2 phase is the second growth phase , also the preparation phase for the cell . M phase or mitosis and cytokinesis , the actual division of the cell into two daughter cells . A surveillance system , so-called `` checkpoints '' , monitor the cell for DNA damage and failure to perform critical processes . Checkpoints can block progression through the phases of the cell cycle if certain conditions are not met . For instance , there is a checkpoint which monitors DNA replication and keeps cells from proceeding to mitosis before DNA replication is completed . Similarly , the spindle checkpoint blocks the transition from metaphase to anaphase within mitosis if not all chromosomes are attached to the mitotic spindle.If this system senses a problem , a network of signaling molecules instructs the cell to stop dividing . They can let the cell know whether to repair the damage or initiate programmed cell death , a form of which is called apoptosis . Programmed cell death ensures that the damaged cell is not further propagated . For example , a certain protein , called p53 , acts to accept signals provoked by DNA damage . It responds by stimulating the production of inhibitory proteins that then halt the DNA replication process . Without proper p53 function , DNA damage can accumulate unchecked . A direct consequence is that the damaged gene progresses into a cancerous state . Today , defects in p53 are associated with a variety of cancers , including some breast and colon cancers.Some cells , such as neurons , never divide once they become locked in a G0 phase . However , recent data has shown that neurons undergoing cell death re-enter the cell cycle . Addition of cell cycle inhibitors prevent this type cell death called apoptosis .",0
"What do you think of President Bush sellin our ports to Arabs ? Update : `` He became aware of it over the last several days , '' McClellan said . Asked if Bush did not know about it until it was a done deal , McClellan said , `` That 's correct . `` First of all , I just want to say that it 's obvious not `` all Arabs are terrorists '' and objection to this port deal is not suggesting in the least bit that they are . You see a lot of the educated Congressmen , of both parties , objecting to the sale of these ports to a UAE company . These are intelligent , educated people and you think that they are objecting to this deal because they believe that all Arabs are terrorists ? I think not . The first perons who answered this question is the one who needs to get educated.It is justifiable to say that giving control of these major US ports to a company in the UAE poses a threat to national security . This situation is comparable to the notion of `` probable cause . '' If a police officer sees a person driving dangerously and erratically he has reason to believe that this person might be intoxicated . If two of the September 11 hijackers came from the UAE and money used to fund those attacks went through UAE banks , we have reason to believe that giving control of major ports to a UAE company is an added threat to security.There is no argument against the fact the UAE is located in a region of the world where anti-Western sentiment is strong . UAE control of these ports gives people a greater opportunity to act of these feelings.Sorry to say , but there is a difference between a British company operating these ports and a UAE company operating these ports . I am a strong supporter of President Bush on 95 % of the issues , but I do not know where his head is regarding this issue , if he really did know about this before the deal was made .",0

"Are there other active geysers in the world besides Yellowstone 's Old Faithful ? Here is an excerpt from a great reference on Geysers : A geyser is a hot spring that periodically erupts , throwing water into the air . Though that sounds simple , geysers are extremely rare . As of December 2005 , the total of active geysers on earth number approximately 1000.Conditions must be just right for geysers to occur . Three components must be present for geysers to exist : an abundant supply of water , an intense source of heat , and unique plumbing . Water is common in nature , heat can come from volcanic activity , but the plumbing is critical . For water to be thrown into the air , geyser plumbing must be water- and pressure-tight . Geyser scientists and observers have identified the volcanic rock rhyolite as being particularly effective at hosting geysers . Rhyolite is high in silica , which can deposit a water-tight seal along the walls of the geyser plumbing . Most of the geyser fields in the world are found in rhyolite or similar silica-laden rocks ( like ignimbrite ) . The mixture of water , volcanic heat , and plumbing is exceptional at Yellowstone National Park . Over one-half of the world 's geysers are located within the park 's boundaries.It is increasingly apparent that geysers must possess a fourth characteristic to exist : remoteness . Within the last fifty years , volcanic heat and abundant water have been increasingly harnessed to turn turbines for electricity production . Geothermal energy can be produced at any site where volcanic heat and water are readily available . Unfortunately , geyser fields are ideal for this type of energy production . Geothermal energy production steals the geysers ' water , and destroys geyser activity ( for example , Wairakei , New Zealand ) . A growing threat to geysers stems from mineral extraction . Hot groundwater may precipitate gold or other valuable minerals , and extraction may require removing the geyser plumbing itself . For example , in May 2003 , mineral exploration at South America ’ s second largest geyser field ( Puchuldiza , Chile ) , caused cessation in the field ’ s geysers . Few realize the actual rarity of geysers . As a result , many geyser fields have been destroyed and many others are being threatened . LocationsYellowstone National Park ( USA ) Valley of Geysers , Kamchatka Peninsula ( Siberia ) El Tatio ( Chile ) North Island , New ZealandIcelandBeowawe Geyser Field , Nevada ( USA ) Steamboat Springs , Nevada ( USA ) Umnak Island , Alaska ( USA ) Other World GeysersAt least a dozen additional locations worldwide are known to contain between one and fourteen geysers .

"Why is the Interior of an airplaine pressurized and what would happen if there was a hole in the exterior wall Explain why the interior of an airplane is pressurized when flying at high altitude . If a hole were punctured in an exterior wall , what would happen to the air pressure inside the plane ? An Airplane is pressurised to provide the same pressure as at sea level , or ground altitude for passanger confort and to provent altutiude sickness . You can not breath the air at 20,000 feet with the same amount of oxygen per beath as at sea level . You would pass out from a lack of oxygen . If you get a hole in the airplane outer wall bernoullis principle says that there would be a fall in presure vacume on the other side of the hole causeing a depressurization of the interior of the aircraft to the pressure of 20,000 feet . With a Depressure of cabin air you would see a fog of water droplets in the air , as the density of water in the air becomes more from the oxygen being sucked out of the cabin . As you have seen in movies the hole will be riped larger if it is big enough to alow a large amount of air though and the structure is weak enough in that area . In alot of aircrafts the outer wall is a part of the pressure system of the aircraft keeping a seperation between internal pressure and external pressure . The whole aircraft is not pressureized wings and rear areas . so a hole in those area would n't cause a problum for the passangers .",0

"what is a brake lining ? Brake linings are composed of a relatively soft but tough and heat-resistant material with a high coefficient of dynamic friction ( and ideally an identical coefficient of static friction ) typically mounted to a solid metal backing using high-temperature adhesives or rivets . The complete assembly ( including lining and backing ) is then often called a brake pad or brake shoe . In this view of an automobile disc brake , the brake pad is the black material held by the red metal component ( the brake caliper ) . The brake lining is that part of the brake pad which actually contacts the metal rotor when the brake is engaged.Using a typical bicycle brake as an example , the backing would be the metal shell which provides mechanical support , and the lining would be the rubbery portion which contacts the rims when the brakes are applied . In most modern vehicular applications the system is conceptually identical , except the rims would be replaced with solid steel ( or sometimes exotic metal ) rotors . Furthermore , a metal tang is usually incorporated into the pad assembly . The tang contacts the rotors when the linings are worn out , causing an annoying noise designed to alert the motorist that brake servicing is required.Since the lining is the portion of the braking system which converts the vehicle 's kinetic energy into heat , the lining must be capable of surviving high temperatures without excessive wear ( leading to frequent replacement ) or outgassing ( which causes brake fade , a decrease in the stopping power of the brake ) . Due to its suitability , asbestos is often a component in brake linings ; as a result , brake dust should never be inhaled",0

"How does the free market environment encourage the economic and socioeconomic goals sought by society ? Free markets economy is an addendum to the laws of nature . Water flows from high to low till equilized . There is no good or bad about it - it just is . The good is - lower parts can get water , the bad part is that water may cause attrition or floods along the way , or simply be wasted in the lower areas . But movement of resources from resource rich to rosurce poor countries/areas follows the same principle . Survival of the fittest is another way of looking at it . In the resourse hungry countries , people will do anything to survive , including accepting low paid jobs . In the resource rich countries , people are at a higher level of Maslow 's triangle , are more complacent and demanding of higher standards of living . This creates a cycle of abundance and deprivation in various areas of the world - thus a boom is always followed by a boom and vice versa.The overall socio-economic goals of a society include equality for all . Free markets are one way of redistributing wealth and adhering to the supply and demand principles . Culture of consumerism necessitates maximizing affordability - so production has to be at the lowest price . If the demand of the same job is high elsewhere , then thats where the jobs will go.Most issues associated with concept of free economy are detrimental to the wellbeing of vulnerable population . Patent issues cause hundreds of thousand deaths/suicides in India and Africa . It amplifies the divide between the rich and the poor . WHO , GATT , JAFAA and NAFTAA are weapons used to coerce governments of small countries . Instead of waging war and occupying countries , the US uses trade economics to control and occupy countries . So Free Trade has really become an intrument of war rather than the instrument of social justice that it was supposed to be.I guess the free economy is a concept - and just like any other concept it has its good and bad . Often the media portrays only one side of the issue - depending on where you live you get to hear one side of the story .",0

"It what ways does the west coast differ from the east ? I am thinkin about moving west but everybodys always saying how its like a whole nother country .

There is a lot of mixing of cultures there , so you will find whites , Hispanics , and people of Indian and Asian descent in large numbers . The west coast is also warmer climate-wise due to the proximity to the desert and the sea . More importantly , for some reason I found the people friendlier than anywhere else in the states . The food is also inspired by different cultures , but you can find a lot of authentic Mexican food there . One word of caution , the west coast is pretty expensive to stay ! On the other hand , the percentage of young population ( and techies ) is very high , so you will find someone for outdoor activites pretty easily .",0

"what makes a man sexy ? , To women please ? please list most important . Appearance : a fit body , very nice clothes , a little cologne , glasses , fuzzy or clean cut.. ? Demeanor : confident , shy , funny , wit humility ? thnks- man without a clue . Appearance : well-groomed , clean-smelling/light cologne , and well dressed . Whether bearded or shaved , long hair or short , being well-groomed ( clean hair and skin , well-trimmed facial hair ) is probably the most important . Well-dressed does n't necessarily mean expensive clothes , but clean , stain-free , and wrinkle-free is important.Demeanor : Confident , witty , humble are all good characteristics.However , there 's this certain way that some men naturally hold themselves that conveys sexuality like some kind of pheremone . It 's this casual , hip-slung sort of stance , accompanied by a direct gaze and a half-smile . Matthew Mcconnaughey has this posture . It sort of says `` I could take care of *all* your needs and have you begging for more ... '' I think most women get past the physical part of attraction fairly quickly . It 's important , but more important is what their guy is like . Not too sensitive ( no tears on the first date , please ! ) , but intuitive to their needs and the needs of those around them.Other than that , it depends on the woman and what she wants !",0

"If satan had appeared as a man instead of a serpent , would Eve had said `` No-way '' ?

Then when I heard one suggested interpretation of Gen 3:16 `` ... Your desire will be for your husband '' to mean to attack or desire his leadership , I thought perhaps the desire would have been there at the fall , ( since Adam 's pass-through instruction of God 's command was ultimately ignored ) and had satan appeared as a man , would she have rejected his recommendation , much like today ? Thoughts ? What a good question . I have now idea . Maybe ( since i am a woman , i should know ) she might have because we women really like to talk . We could talk to a tree if we needed to .

"who is william blake ? William Blake ( November 28 , 1757 – August 12 , 1827 ) was an English poet , painter and printmaker . Though largely unrecognised during his lifetime , today Blake 's work is almost universally considered that of a genius . According to Northrop Frye , who undertook a study of Blake 's entire poetic opus , his prophetic poems form `` what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the [ English ] language '' . Others have praised Blake 's visual artistry , in particular his engravings : `` [ Blake ] is far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced '' [ 1 ] .However , viewing Blake 's accomplishments in either poetry or in the visual arts separately is to do him a disservice ; Blake himself saw these two disciplines as being cohorts in a unified spiritual endeavour , and they are inseparable in a proper appreciation of his work .",0
"I 'm want to be a game designer , but I 'm only 15 . What should I do ? A few things to consider : One , what part of game development interests you ? Broadly speaking , there are three roles involved in the development of games : Programmers - game developers , testers , and tools programmers . These are the people who do the actual work of building the game , and create the program that makes everything happen.Artists - 3d modelers and 2d artists and texturers . These are the people who create the `` look '' of the game - every object that appears on-screen has to be modeled , and the surfaces of the objects need to `` painted '' to resemble whatever they 're supposed to be.Designers - level designers , interaction designers and `` game designers . '' These are the people who figure out how things work , and create the `` feel '' of what it 's like to play the game . There ususally are n't many on a development team , and they often end up doing other organizational work , too.What to study depends on which of these sounds appealing . If you like the idea of game programming , then study how to program and practice writing code for fun . If art appeals , get a 3d modeler or 2d painting software and learn to create things with it . If you want to design , make sure you understand at least a little bit about programming and art , and practice your writing and speaking - designers need to be able to communicate.For all of these roles , learn to play videogames with a critical eye - when a game is n't fun , ask yourself why it is n't fun . When a game is , ask what succeeds about it . What could make it better ? A good way to learn about what makes games fun is to play and create board and card games - learning games as a whole , and being able to talk about them intelligently will be a big help.And , if you decide that gaming is n't for you later , then an education based around the fundamentals of design like that will leave you able to do quite a bit besides gaming.Good luck !",0

"what is an interrupt ? There is a good summary of what an interrupt is at the sources listed below . Cutting and pasting the content from one link : A signal informing a program that an event has occurred . When a program receives an interrupt signal , it takes a specified action ( which can be to ignore the signal ) . Interrupt signals can cause a program to suspend itself temporarily to service the interrupt . Interrupt signals can come from a variety of sources . For example , every keystroke generates an interrupt signal . Interrupts can also be generated by other devices , such as a printer , to indicate that some event has occurred . These are called hardware interrupts . Interrupt signals initiated by programs are called software interrupts . A software interrupt is also called a trap or an exception . PCs support 256 types of software interrupts and 15 hardware interrupts . Each type of software interrupt is associated with an interrupt handler -- a routine that takes control when the interrupt occurs . For example , when you press a key on your keyboard , this triggers a specific interrupt handler . The complete list of interrupts and associated interrupt handlers is stored in a table called the interrupt vector table , which resides in the first 1 K of addressable memory .",0

The acid is produced by bacteria in the mouth that feed on sugar ( and , actually , simple starches , which are converted to sugar by saliva ) . The acid dissolves the enamel of the tooth surface causing little holes in the teeth .",0

"what do you know about SOURASHTRA ? Sourashtra ( alternate names and spellings : Palkar , Sowrashtra , Saurashtra , Saurashtri , Patnuli ) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in parts of the Southern Indian State of Tamil Nadu . The Ethnologue puts the number of speakers at 310,000 ( 1997 IMA ) , although the actual number could be double this figure or even more.ClassificationSourashtra is a Indo-Aryan language belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family.Geographical DistributionThe speakers of the Sourashtra language , known as Sourashtrians , maintain a predominant presence in Madurai , a city in the southern part of Tamil Nadu . Though official figures are hard to come by , it is believed that the Sourashtra population makes up for about one-third of the city 's total population . They are present in significant numbers in the cities of Dindigul , Paramakudi , Erode , Palani , Rajapalayam , Nilakottai , Salem , Thanjavur , Trichy , Kumbakonam , Thiruvarur and Kottar ( Nagercoil ) . A sizable number is also found in Chennai , Bangalore and other parts of India , but this presence is largely due to small-scale migrations in the last few decades from one of the aforesaid traditional Sourashtrian settlements.It is also believed that Sourashtra speakers exist , albeit in small numbers , in other southern states such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka . However , in the absence of any reliable facts to substantiate this claim , this remains a speculation at best.HistoryThough there is little historical evidence available to support the argument that the Sourashtrians lived in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat in Western India , folklore , and recent linguistic and genetic researches have been able to establish that this region was indeed once the habitat of the Sourashtrians . However , their language has more similarities with Marathi and Konkani , both Indo-Aryan languages of Western India , than it does with Modern Gujarati , the language of present-day Gujarat . Linguists have been able to explain why it is so : Both Sourashtra and Gujarati branched off from a common parent , and have since taken completely different paths to modernity . Gujarati came under the influence of Persian , Arabic , many tribal languages and Hindi , whereas Sourashtra , taking off from Gujarat before it had made any Muslim contact , was influenced by Marathi , Konkani , Kannada , Telugu , and finally , Tamil . It has been acknowledged that Persian and Arabic have had only limited influence on Marathi and Konkani , and this is why they still retain a good amount of vocabulary and grammar derived from Sanskrit , as compared to other daughter languages of Sanskrit . It is possible that the vocabulary and grammar shared between Modern Sourashtra and Marathi is what was originally derived from Sanskrit.The southward flight of the Sourashtrians seems to have been triggered by the frequent Muslim invasions of their homeland and the instability caused by it . No details are available as to whether it was a mass-migration and when it took place . They found the safe haven they were looking for in the Vijayanagar Kingdom , with its capital at Hampi in present-day Karnataka , which was then expanding southwards . They , whose traditional occupation was weaving , were able to impress upon the Emperor with their weaving skills , and soon were elevated to the position of Royal Weavers . Telugu and Kannada were the court languages , though other languages such as Sanskrit and Tamil were also in use . It was during this period that Sourashtra started absorbing Telugu and Kannada words into its lexicon.Vijayanagar rulers had the practice of appointing Governors , known as Nayaks , to manage far-flung regions of the empire . When Madurai and Thanjavur were annexed to the empire , Governors were appointed to administer the new territories . It is believed that a part of the Sourashtra community moved to Madurai and Thanjavur to serve the Governors . ****Hey why di they suspend you from yahoo*****",0

Why do people lie about insignificant things ? I think it depends on an individuals personality . Some lie because they may be afraid of the other persons/peoples reaction .

"How do you bind a vampire or a werewolf ? Aside from holy water , garlic , etc. , what do the myths say ? If werewolves can be killed with a silver bullet , with what material do you capture them alive ? Do plain metal chains work ? Or do they have to be made of certain materials ? The Slavs ( from around the year 300 ) believed that vampires were afraid of silver ( but could n't be killed with it ) and that one could kill them by cutting their head off and placing it between their legs , or by stabbing them with a wooden stake in the heart . During the Middle Ages , the myth transformed a bit . People used holy water , wooden stake , and cross to kill a vampire ( we can see the influence of the Christianity here ) . If people suspected that a dead person has turned into a vampire , they would dig them out and stick a stake into the heart . This was n't meant to kill the vampire but to bind it to the grave . Serbs believed that every single drop of blood had to be destroyed or else the vampire would still be `` alive '' ( they were more or less living corpses , but you get my point ) so they used to burn the vampire after that . Then butterflies would fly out of the vampire and people had to kill each one of them . Garlic can only scare the vampire because of its strong and unpleasant smell . In order to stop the vampire 's visits at night , people would hang garlic near every hole in the house ( for example keyhole , chimney , windows ... , because people believed that the vampire could enter the house even through the smallest hole ) . One could also throw some seeds before the vampire , since they had to stop and count them all . I 'm not really sure how they used to capture them . I know vampires could be captured by stealing that cloth they had over them in the grave , but I have seen this only in vampire stories . But in reality , people were just killing them and they were probably too scared to just capture them ( that 'd be pointless , would n't it ) . Although in Asia there were some kinds of vampires which people used to capture and then keep them in wooden cages and feed them eggs : P I have n't heard of any captured werewolves either . If you want to investigate a bit , try reading some legends and old beliefs from the Balkans ; I promise you 'll find it very interesting !",0

"What is the speed of light in inches per second ? Hi Writholeen , the only flaw in JayNick 's answer is the accuracy part . As per the National Institute of Standards and Technology , the exact value of Speed of Light in vacuum is 299,792,458 m/s . By exact , I mean there is no uncertainity till the last digit . To be precise , what we usually call the `` speed of light '' is really the speed of light in a vacuum ( the absence of matter ) . In reality , the speed of light depends on the material that light moves through . Thus , for example , light moves slower in glass than in air , and in both cases the speed is less than in a vacuum . However , the density of matter between the stars is sufficiently low that the actual speed of light through most of interstellar space is essentially the speed it would have through a vacuum , so we do n't make much error by ignoring the difference.To make it easier for you to convert , here is the speed in alternative units : ( 1 ) 983,571,056.4304461 foot/second ( 2 ) 11,802,852,677.165352 inch/second ( 3 ) 1,079,252,848.8 kilometer/hour ( 4 ) 299,792.458 kilometer/second ( 5 ) 582,749,918.3585312 knot ( 6 ) 880,991.0899527 mach ( 7 ) 670,616,629.3843952 mile/hour ( mph ) These values are accurate to the 7th digit of decimal . Flaw in JayNick 's answer : The speed of light in kilometres per second is 279,600 kilometres/sec . Even if you approximate the actual value , 299,792.458 kilometer/second by round off the last three digit , the value would have been 300,000 kilometers per second .",0

"Getting started as a Financial Analyst ? I have a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and have over 5 years of experience in the field . Unfortunately I 've decided that it 's not my cup of tea and I have recently looked into switching careers.I 've always been an analytical and thorough person so I feel a career as a financial analyst in a corporate setting ( as opposed to an investment bank ) would suit me well . I 've already taken about 6 accounting classes and have gotten A 's in all of my classes . The only problem is , I do n't know where to get started . What 's the best way into the position ? My options at the moment are : * Get an Associates Degree in Accounting* Get a second Bachelors Degree in Accounting/Finance* Get a Masters Degree in Accounting* Take the CPA exam w/o the required work experienceOut of all of these options , what 's the best choice in getting hired ? I believe your best option is to obtain your bachelors degree in accounting/finance . Inherently , this is a more attractive degree due to the amount of education obtained . Furthermore , any respectable company will require a bachelors degree for a financial analyst position.While the other two options are not bad , they will not help you greatly so I would do them only if it is in addition to the second bachelors degree . Passing the CPA exam without the work experience will not obtain you your certification , which is the true `` resume value '' so you would have only passed a test and would have an interest dinner conversation piece at best.The masters degree in accounting is also nice as a supplement to your bachelors degree , but entirely unnecessary . Most firms/corporations you talk with are not interested in a graduate degree unless it is specifically applicable to the position , which for a financial analyst position it is not . Those are just my thoughts.. : - )",0

"Where are my virgins at ? Anyone choosing not to have sex these days ? Any thoughts ? Well I am a 17 year old abstinent girl , and there are n't many people out there choosing not to have sex . Where did all the virgins go ? ? What are your thoughts on being abstinent ? Hi there , I know that the pressure of being a virgin is extremely hard for one to handle , especially in the Western societies that we live in ; but virginity is worth striking for . I 'm in my 20s and the group of friends that I have is also in their 20s and we are all virgins . I think the most important thing that one needs to keep in mind is that virginity is for ONESELF , not for anyone else ( or sometimes you might wan na save it for you future husband ) . Once you are determined about it , it would be less difficult when you think of whether to have sex or not . My friends and I choose not to have sex before marriage b/c we see SEX as LOVE , and we respect our body as well as our partners ' .

"how are ionic solids formed ? Ionic solids are indeed formed by a gain and loss of electrons . More specifically , they are formed by a chemical reaction between a metal atom and a nonmetal atom . For example , sodium , a metal , has a tendency to want to lose an electron , and bromine , a nonmetal , wants to gain an electron , so the sodium gives an electron to bromin ( which is now called bromide ) . Now sodium has lost an electron , which is negatively charged , so it has a net charge of 1+ . Bromine has gained an electron , so it has a net charge of -1 . Since they are oppositely charged , they are attracted to each other ( kind of like how opposite poles of magnets are atracted to each other ) , they ionically bond and become an ionic solid ( also known as a salt ) .",0

"When people talk about their `` relationship '' with Jesus , what exactly do they mean ? By characterizing one 's faith in Christ as having a relationship with him , a person implies that that there is an ongoing dialog of sorts ( perhaps non-verbal ) between the believer and the Lord.I mean , if you 've been touched in some way by Jesus once in your life , would n't it be more accurately characterized as an encounter , or an introduction ? Perhaps even an acquaintance ? I recently went to a Starbucks in an unfamiliar town . I paid the girl behind the counter $ 1.70 for my cup of coffee , and left . I do n't believe I will ever see her again . Does that mean I have a `` relationship '' as well ? And if you 've maintained ongoing contact with Jesus , then certainly , you would have sufficient personal experience with your savior to no longer characterize your beliefs as `` faith . '' After all this contact with the Lord , should n't you regard it as `` fact ? `` Just wondering ... It is okay if you think I am nuts but here goes.I talk to God by prayer , sometimes silently and sometimes outloud . God talks to me occassionaly at His time frame , In other words I do n't have to be in a prayerful or spiritual mood for Him to speak . I can not explain it but when He speaks to me , it is not silent in my head and it is not audible so that others can hear it but it is clearly audible to me.So yes , I have a relationship with Him . I also can feel His prescense in my life.Look to John 8:47 , & 10:26-30 Jesus stated my sheep hear my voice and they know me ( Jesus ) and follow me . God may not communicate with everyone the same as He does with me but if you do not hear His voice in some manner then you do n't know Him . My relationship with Him indeed started out as faith but you are correct in the change that takes place . I can not prove this relationship to anyone but to me it is fact . You can not achieve fact without first having faith .",0

"do you believe in god ? I know there is a God . I did n't arrive at this conclusion by my intellect , for human intelligence is limited . Give up on trying to figure everything out , for common sense itself should tell you that you ca n't know or understand everything . This is not a matter of the head , but of the heart . Ask yourself this : `` If God is the truth , do I really want to know the truth ? '' Our sinfulness makes us afraid of a holy and righteous God who we feel must demand an accounting of us His creatures . Atheists say they do n't believe in God , but I do n't believe in atheists . If they do n't believe in God , then who are they so mad at ? They claim wisdom and knowledge and call believers simple , but I see atheists as being extremely smallminded and limited . Did atoms and microbes not exist until some human came along who was smart enough to detect them ? How small these people 's reality must be ! How futile and pointless their existence ! I commend you for at least being openminded enough to ask ? How foolish it is to think that one 's ignorance is evidence ! Thanks for not being that way , wisdom is not beyond the grasp of one such as yourself . There is a God ; He is beyond human comprehension ; He is absolutely holy , righteous , and frightfuly just . His awesome majesty and power is terrifying and he is completely unapproachable by vile , prideful humans . Remember I said that it is our innate sense of this reality that drives some to deny His existense out of fear of the truth . They ca n't face themselves and their guilt , and they ca n't face a righteously angry , holy , and just God whom they rightly think will demand retribution of them . What they do n't understand is that this same God is also infinitely loving , kind , gracious and merciful , and that He paid the penalty for their sins and removed their guilt which was keeping them from Him . How ? He gave us His only begotten Son Jesus Christ who took our sins and guilt upon his holy and innocent self and was put to death so that we may go free . Believe this , make claim to it as a FREE GIFT from God , confess it to Him and to others , then walk in peace from now on with Him , always trusting Jesus ' sacrifice as your justification in God 's eyes , not your own merit . Then keep on learning more of Him and growing spiritually. > < > Sir Brian",0

"Any economists out there ? Student who needs help ! ! ? I 'm in college , & need help with my macroeconomics class . I took a quiz , and got 5 questions wrong . My teacher is disputing that they 're wrong , but I say they 're right ! ! Thank you in advance for your help . The questions are : The ability-to-pay tax principle ca n't be applied to : ( she said the correct answer was welfare ) . The ability to pay tax principle states that : Those with a greater ability to pay ( such as those with a higher income , or those who own more property ) should pay more taxes . I do n't see how welfare ( or her other choices of post office , & highway ) fit into this principle . Yes , we as users of the highway & post offices pay taxes , ( these services are supplied by the government ) but people that use welfare also pay taxes . The only way I can see this to be a part of it , is that highways can make money by tolls & post offices by postage , & welfare is giving money away to citizens . Thank you , and I have 4 more , but no space to post , so I 'm going to do individual questions . Welfare is essentially a negative tax , which goes right in hand with the ability-to-pay tax principle . They so lack an ability to pay that they are instead paid by the Social Security Insurance tax that everyone who can pay does .",0

"i need to know phisical chemical properties of sodium thiocyanate ? from the link below , which includes a lot more information : Cyanic acid ( also called fulminic acid ) is an unstable ( explosive ) , poisonous , volatile , clear liquid with the structure of H-O-C=N ( the oxoacid formed from the pseudohalogen cyanide ) , which readily polymerizes to cyamelide and fulminic acid . Cyanuric acid ( also called pyrolithic acid ) , white monoclinic crystal with the structure of [ HOC ( NCOH ) 2N ] , is the compound of polymerized cyanic acid . Cyanic acid hydrolyses to ammonia and carbon dioxide in water . Its salts and esters are cyanates ( or called fulminates ) . Esters of normal cyanic acid are not known . There is another isomeric cyanic acid with the structure of H-N=C=O , which is called isocyanic acid . Its salts and esters are isocyanates . Cyanates ( or Isocyanates ) are used in the manufacturing pharmaceuticals , pesticides , textile softener , lubricants and industrial disinfectants through the conversion to polycyclic compounds ( such as hydantoins and imidazolons ) They are used as plastic additives and as heat treatment salt formulations for metals . Thiocyanate is a salt or ester of thiocyanic acid ( HSCN ) . Aqueous solutions of thiocyanic acid , also called sulfocyanic acid , are very strong acids of the equilibrium mixture of thiocyanic and isothiocyanic . Thiocyanates are bonded through the sulfur ( s ) with the structure R-S-C¡ÕN or the isomeric R-N=C=S ( isothiocyanates ) . Thiocyanates are bonded through the sulfur ( s ) which replace for the oxygen ( O ) atom . Thiocyanates are the sulfur analog of isocyanates . Organic as well as metallic thiocyanates [ CuSCN , Ca ( SCN ) 2 , NaSCN , KSCN ] are very versatile compounds . They have wide range of applications including manufacturing industrial chemicals , pharmaceuticals and pesticides . It is used in freezing solutions , fabric dyeing , electroplating , steel pickling , printing , and corrosion inhibitor against acid gases .

"whats happens with egg pressure and how much can it take how do i messure it ? mike ? how do i messure egg pressure how can u make it so that u can make the question a science fair topic The pressure within a chicken egg may be rather nominal , because eggs breathe without lungs . Oxygen is free to diffuse through the shell . Water is nearly incompressible , the effect even seven miles down at the bottom of the sea is nil . Gas is highly compressible and you have to halve the volume to double the pressure at constant temperature , per the perfect gas laws.Most boiled eggs are not perfectly ovalic because there is an air space within the shell . That air space would resist any increase in `` hydraulic '' pressure and excess gas should diffuse out of the shell.Of course a spoiled egg may build up pressure due to rapid decomposition and an egg shell would be fairly strong to retain it . Never microwave eggs because they may build up steam pressure and make a real mess . Early microwave machines had perforated plastic doors rather than solid glass and I recall one unhappy fellow who received a polkadot egg spattered shirt . Good luck .",0

"someone tell me inlaymans terms , why it is impossible for physical objects to travel at the speed of light ? Here are two explanations ( neither particularly satisfying I will tell you in advance . ) The first is that the speed of light ( in a vaccuum ) is a property of the universe that is measured the same by everyone , regardless of their motion relative to anyone else . This is a true statement born out by experiment , but it implies some very weird stuff . One is that distance and time are not measured the same by people in relative motion . Another is that you can never get closer to a beam of light going away from you ( i.e . go faster than the speed of light ) . If you could , you would measure the speed of light differently than someone else , and you would be special . The basic idea behind relativity is that , with regard to the laws of physics , no one is special . The second unsatisfying answer is E=mc^2 . In order to go faster , you have to accelerate . Acceleration takes energy , and an accelerating body has more mass than a body in a constant state of motion ( increase E in that equation m has go up , because c is the constant speed of light ) . It just so happens that the mass does n't go up in proportion to the rate of acceleration , but in relationship to how close you are to the speed of light . Everytime you halve the distance between your speed and the speed of light , your mass doubles , and the amount of effort needed to get that next bit of acceleration doubles . Getting to the speed of light would require infinite energy .",0

"What is lake-effect snow ? Lake effect snow is also know as a snowsquall . It is produced in the winter when cold winds move across long expanses of warmer lake water , picking up water vapor which freezes and is deposited on the lee shores . This effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic effect of higher elevations on the downwind shores . This uplifting can produce narrow , but very intense bands of precipitation , which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow per hour . The areas affected by lake effect snow are called snowbelts.Cold winds in the winter typically prevail from the west-southwest to the northwest in the North Temperate Zone , producing the most dramatic lake effect snow falls on the northeast to south east shores of the Great Lakes . This lake effect produces a significant difference between the snow fall on the eastern and western shores of the Great Lakes . If the air temperature is not low enough to keep the precipitation frozen , it falls as lake effect rain.To can read a detailed article on Lake Snow Effect , Variables Contributing to Lake Effect Snow and Areas Hit By Lake Effect Snow and much more at the following articles : ( 1 ) http : //www.noaa.gov/questions/question_011602.html ( 2 ) http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_effect_snow ( 3 ) http : //www.usatoday.com/weather/tg/wlakeeff/wlakeeff.htm ( 4 ) http : //www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/ ( 5 ) http : //www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap10/lake_effect_snow.html",0

Pitching looks better is Foulke gets back to his prime condition and if Schills can go strong the entire season . Not a bad outlook , considering Coco Crisp fills a huge HOLE the Red Sox had .",0

You can start with the front and work your way to the back as you can lightly slap her butt as well , but not too hard as it 'll probably ruin the whole sexual mood .

"what is the main trust of Scriven model of educational evaluation ? Scriven defines “ models ” : as a term loosely used to refer to a conception or approach or sometimes even a method ( e.g. , naturalistic , goal-free ) of doing evaluation ... Models are to paradigms as hypotheses are to theories , which means less general but with some overlap . His best known model is Goals-Free Evaluation which supplements inherent weaknesses in a goals-oriented approach by providing an unbiased perspective of ongoing events . Developed in 1972 , this model in this model , the evaluator begins by examining outcomes of the program and attempts to infer the intended objectives from these observations.The evaluator then identifies and interviews actual participants rather than program management and staff . Idea is to discover whether evaluator can match observed ( implicit ) goals with stated ( explicit ) goals without biasing the evaluation in advance by being told what they are `` supposed to be '' .",0

"Why does science and religion conflict with each other so much ? Old Goat is correct . It would help to know specifics . But consider just ONE example . The book of Job is the oldest book in the Bible . It even predates Moses . So , in that period of time , how did other cultures view the earth ? Flat , supported by Atlas or giant elephants ... But look what it reads in the book of Job ... `` God hangs the earth on nothing . '' And in Isaiah it reads , `` It is God who sits above the circle of the earth . '' That word `` circle '' in Hebrew is ball or sphere . So if people poopoo the Bible with their lofty scientific thinking , they have probably not even read the Bible to check . I know scientists who have read the Bible , and are amazed at how accurate it is.We know that all matter is made up of atoms and electrons . I nor any scientist has ever seen an electron . But because of scientific study , we know they exist . The Bible reads in Hebrews 11:3 ... '' Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear . `` So the only conflict comes when secular scientist blow off the Bible without cause . I have many other examples .",0

"What is the church of scientology ? Literally , Scientology means the study of truth . Scientologists believe that man is an immortal spiritual being whose experiences extend far beyond just this lifetime . According to Scientology , man 's capabilities are unlimited , even if they are not presently realized.Scientologists believe that painful memories from our past can hinder our ability to realize our limitless potential . For this , Scientologists offer auditing which enables people to remove the painful effects of these bad memories . Practically , auditing is a type of counseling using a lie detetector called an E-meter . In auditing , the auditor never invalidates what the pre-clear says . The ultimate aim of auditing is so people can attain the state of `` Clear , '' or a state of freedom from painful past memories . Clears are free from psychosomoatic illnesses , self determined , vigorous and persistent.Scientology 's aims are a civilization without insanity , without criminals and without wars . Where the able can prosper , where honest beings can have rights and where man is free to rise to greater heights.For this purpose , Scientologists run many humanitarian organizations including Narconon and Criminon , helping people get off drugs , the Citizens Commission on Human Rights , which fights psychiatric abuse , the Applied Scholastics educational system and the Way to Happiness Foundation .",0

The best advice I have for this is keep trying and test it in an inconspicuous area first if you ca n't bear to have a bigger spot on your shirt .",0

"Who discovered the planet Pluto and how did it get its name ? Pluto was discovered by the astronomer Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona on February 18 , 1930 . In the matter of Pluto the discretion of naming the new object belonged to Lowell Observatory and its director , Vesto Melvin Slipher , who , in the words of Tombaugh , was `` urged to suggest a name for the new planet before someone else did '' . The name retained for the planet is that of the Roman god Pluto , and it is also intended to evoke the initials of the astronomer Percival Lowell , who predicted that a planet would be found beyond Neptune . The name was first suggested by Venetia Burney , at the time an eleven-year-old girl from Oxford , England . Over the breakfast table , one morning her grandfather , who worked at Oxford University 's Bodleian Library , was reading about the discovery of the new planet in the Times newspaper . He asked his granddaughter what she thought would be good name for it . Venetia thought that as it was so cold and so distant it should be named after the Roman God of the underworld . Professor Herbert Hall Turner cabled his colleagues in America with this suggestion , and after favourable consideration which was almost unanimous , the name Pluto was officially adopted and an announcement made by Slipher on May 1 , 1930 .",0

Algae and higher plants are called eukaryotic . They tend to have two different types of genetic material , one located in the nucleus and a different type located in the cell ’ s mitochondrion . Bacteria , on the other hand , are called prokaryotic . They only contain one type of genetic material . Some bacteria ’ s genetic material resembles that found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells . Some bacteria DNA or RNA more closely resembles that of mitochondrion.Proper cleavage of the genetic material , followed by TLC or possibly paper chromatography , could show the similarities or differences . This could be used to infer ( not prove ) any evolutionary relationships .",0
"What is best prop for Yamaha 250 outboard ? The selection of the best propeller is a combination of many different factors , such as type of boat , L.O.A of boat , type of hull , use and performance ( i.e . : better top end speed or increased load carrying performance ? ) First of all , for an engine like this I would recommend a stainless steel propeller . SS propellers are stronger than most all other propeller materials with main advantages : longer life and high hydrodynamic efficiency derived from stiffer blades . To select the optimum propeller for the use of your boat and motor combination , you should make some test runs , keeping the following guidelines in mind : -Have a selection of propellers to test with . -Use an accurate tachometer to measure RPM . -Use an accurate speedometer or some means ( i.e . : G.P.S . ) to measure boat speed . -Safely test each setup at W.O.T . -Make sure every test is with `` identical '' settings . ( i.e . : Boat load , trim angle , engine height , water conditions , etc . ) Since Yamaha 250 is a power trim equipped engine , it should be tested at optimum trim angle which is the highest trim position that can be run without excessive venting ( slippage ) either in a straight line or in turns . Selecting the right propeller while testing , you must have in mind that : -Engine RPM at W.O.T . must be within the recommended operating range with the rated horsepower RPM as the target number ( see specification in Operator 's Manual ) . -Increasing or decreasing propeller pitch directly affects engine load throughout its RPM range . -A high pitch and/or diameter propeller on an engine , will result in lower engine RPM throughout its entire RPM range for a given throttle setting . -A low pitch and/or diameter propeller on the engine , will result in higher engine RPM throughout its entire RPM range for a given throttle setting . -A boat 's hull design -- and condition -- may limit its overall performance . -Transom height , transom angle and engine trim angle , all affect propeller performance . -Atmospheric pressure , temperature , and humidity also affect engine performance , which directly affects propeller performance . -Salt water is more buoyant than fresh water ; this may cause some hulls to run faster than identical freshwater setups . -Water and wind conditions can play a big part in boat performance and propeller efficiency . -The boat 's load and position of the load can significantly affect performance.Generally , the rule of the thumb is that the correct size propeller will provide the best overall fuel economy and performance.If I could have some more data , I think I would be able to give a couple of suggestions concerning number of blades , pitch and diameter for your engine/boat combination .",0

In baseball , a slider ( also known as a `` nickel curve '' ) is a pitch halfway between a curveball and a fastball , with less break but more speed than the curve . It will tend to drop less and move toward or away from the batter more than a curve . The extra speed can fool the hitter into thinking it is a fastball , until too late . Some pitchers also use a cut fastball ( or cutter ) which is one step closer than the slider to the fastball on the spectrum between fastballs and curves . A pitch that has movement similar to both a slider and a curveball is sometimes called a slurve.In addition , the term 'slider ' often refers to mini hamburgers , such as those at White Castle or often served at pubs .",0

"What is the bladder 's job ? In the anatomy of mammals , the urinary bladder is the organ that collects urine excreted by the kidneys prior to disposal by urination . Urine enters the bladder via the ureters and exits via the urethra. -- -- -- -- -AnatomyThe urinary bladder is a hollow , muscular and distensible organ that sits on the pelvic floor ( superior to the prostate in males ) . On its anterior border lies the pubic symphysis and , on its posterior border , the vagina ( in females ) and rectum ( in males ) . The urinary bladder is normally capable of storing 1.1-1.3 liters of urine , but because it is made up of transitional epithelium it is able to stretch to volumes of even several litres.The ureters enter the bladder diagonally from its dorsolateral floor in an area called the trigone . The trigone is a triangular shaped area on the postero-inferior wall of the bladder . The urethra exits at the lowest point of the triangle of the trigone -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Detrusor muscleThe detrusor muscle is a layer of the urinary bladder wall , made up of smooth muscle fibers arranged in inner and outer longitudinal layers and a middle circular layer . Contraction of the detrusor muscle causes the bladdar to expel urine through the urethra . Problems with this muscle can lead to incontinence .",0

"What the meaning of `` CALIFORNIA `` ?

There is no agreement among scholars.The name California comes from a mythical Spanish island ruled by a queen called Califia that was featured in a Spanish romance ( `` Las Sergas de Esplandian '' ) written by Garcia Ordonez de Montalvo in 1510 .

"How people judge people ? do you judge people by looks , personality , way-of thinking ... Initially , people judge people by appearance and actions , because these are the first things that you can observe about someone . You can judge this up close or from a distance . People usually judge based on comparing another person to their own appearance , and how much the appearance differs from their own appearance.If someone takes the time to get to know someone , they will judge a person on `` deeper '' issues : intelligence , ways of spending time , ways of treating others , and beliefs . Of course , these again are perceived by the person that is doing the judging , and they 're usually compared to their own characteristics/beliefs.Should people judge people ? Yes , and no . It 's good to have standards that you expect of people , in terms of how you are treated , and standards of common decency . However , one should keep in mind that this world would be a boring place if we were all the same , and that everyone does not have the same experiences that you have . So , although judging is hard to avoid , you have to control what you do with your judgements . And it 's always good to reassess what you think of someone . Try to get to know people better .",0

"What are the elements of tragedy found in John Steinbeck 's work ? i have to do a research paper and i ca n't figure out what John Steinbeck uses for his elements of tragedy ( in the books , The Pearl ...

Cannery Row The Pearl : Kino finds the pearl in answer to his prayer to help heal Coyotito 's scorpion sting , and in Kino 's frenzy to keep the pearl and survive , he ends up killing Coyotito.The Grapes of Wrath : Rose of Sharon 's ( Rosasharn 's ) baby , the hope of the future through the whole book , who is to be the firstborn of a new generation in California where the family hopes to find steady work rather than the same unlivable drudgery they have in Oklahoma , is stillborn because the Joads could not escape that poverty.Of Mice and Men : Because of the harshness of the life of itinerant farmworkers , Lennie does not recieve the help and comfort he needs , and accidentally kills Curly 's wife . Thus , George is forced to kill Lennie , the person he swore he 'd protect . Cannery Row : Mack and the boys work to throw a party for Doc , but when Doc does n't arrive , the party gets out of hand and Doc 's home , laboratory , and possessions are destroyed . Also : Frankie 's love for Doc , the only person who ever showed him any kind of nice treatment , becomes his downfall when Frankie steals a $ 75 clock for Doc and is arrested and sent to an institution.Also : the tale of the first bouncer at the Bear Flag Restaurant , who killed himself when he believed that no one loved him , after he took whiskey to Mack and the boys and they still would n't accept him into their group.There are more tragic elements in all these books .

"How do I start the new Beta Yahoo Email ? This is what I found about Yahoo ! Mail Beta.====================================================Click on the below link to see how the Yahoo ! Email Beta looks like : http : //jeremy.zawodny.com/i/candygram-search.pngI 'm surprised that people are still emailing me to ask `` when are you gon na write something about the new Yahoo ! Mail ? `` I figured that with Walt Mossberg saying : I 've been comparing the new version of Yahoo Mail , which claims to be the leader in Web mail , with Gmail , the challenger Yahoo most fears . My verdict : The new Yahoo Mail is far superior to Gmail . Yahoo more closely matches the desktop experience most serious email users have come to expect ... .and PC Magazine saying : ... there 's no question that Yahoo ! is set to make a big leap forward with its new Web-based mail product . We 'll hold off on a rating until the official release or at least the full public beta , but from what we 've seen and tested so far , Yahoo ! 's competition may soon have some serious catching up to do ... .and the AP saying : Overall , I find Yahoo easier to use , and it 's quite impressive for a product that 's only weeks old . I expect even more features by the time a final version is released.Well , I figured that the cat was pretty well out of the bag : the new Yahoo ! Mail kicks a lot of ass . For lots of people out there , it 's going to be the first web-based replacement for Outlook or Outlook express they 've ever seen.And it 's got some serious `` WOW '' factor going for it . I still remember when Ethan turned on my access a few months ago . I was at home packing for my trip to Parowan when he gave me the URL . The interface loaded up and I just thought ... wow ! It was slower back then and has some bugs but it was already clear that it was going to move expectations up a level or two.Oh , and if you look at that screenshot , you 'll see that there are over 42,000 messages in my inbox . The product still works well with a big volume of mail.Now stop asking when I 'm gon na write about it ! : - ) BTW , It is a closed beta right now but that should change soon . In the meantime I 've asked the Yahoo ! Mail team if I could give out a few `` invites '' so faithful readers could try it out . No response yet , so no promises . But let me know if you think you could really use it ...",0

"sbc offers different price rates for dsl . what is the best if my son will be playing x box live ? is there different speeds with different pricing ? with what we have now he 's playing people that have cable dsl and he keeps getting booted off Xbox Live is just like any online game . The biggest issue you will ever see has to do with Latency , also known as `` Lag '' . Latency occurs when there are bottlenecks in the general network layout . Think LA freeways at 5pm on a Friday night . Unfortunately this issue is not one you can change , because it has to do with the actual design of the network , so choosing your provider properly is essential.Cable Internet , in its basic form , is a shared medium . This means that every person who subscribes to Cable in your neighborhood shares the same on-ramp to the internet . This is only a problem if there are large numbers of concurrent users in your area.DSL , on the other hand , connects you to the backbone in a more efficient , seperated manner . This has the advantage of being much less susceptible to latency . Unfortunately , this advantage goes down the farther away from the switching office ( CO ) you are . Another thing to consider is newer Cable networks tend to use a different model of communications than the old ones , and so approach DSL levels of service.To sum up : DSL is better than Cable , but tends to be slower . However any speed higher than about 1 meg / sec should be MORE than sufficient to run today 's games .",0

"Do Publishing Companies Enforce Copyright Infringement Lawsuits ? I have a friend who was selling solutions manuals on ebay ( PDF files ) and ebay stopped the listings but not before he sold several manuals . My friend is not a bigtime operator and did n't know the copyright laws . One of the publishing companies recently sent him a letter telling him that he commited piracy and that they could sue him for LOTS of money and possibly even have him pay for their law fees . However they also said that they would give him 10 days to accept a resolution in which he would pay the companies all profits derived from the manuals and an additional $ 100 dollars for legal costs incurred to date . If my friend does not accept the resolution will the publishing company file a suit ? Can they really ask for an additional $ 100 dollars ? My friend would love some advice ... preferably from somebody familiar with the law . Thank you ! Ignorance of the law is no excuse and no defense . The oopyright statement is WRITTEN RIGHT IN THE MANUALS your friend was selling ! As they have access to the records of the sales via eBay , and know who did it , yes , they will most likely pursue to matter thru the courts to seek satisfaction if your friend does not cooperate . They are not just being mean , but they need to protect their property , whether it was one copy or one million copies . It was not your friend 's property to sell , and the profits he made from the sales should be restituted to the company , as well as the amount they had to expend to get the money back .",0
"If the Google people are supposed to be so smart , how come so many of their recent UIs are lame ? Google reader is pretty bad . Google desktop is clunky ( although a good idea in theory ) . Google groups is lame . Heck even their Google Answers sucks in comparison to this Yahoo Answers site.In addition , it seems to me that yahoo , ask.com and some others are innovating more on search results . For example , enter in a name of a sports team ( in season ) on different search engines and you 'll see a good example of what I mean.Do they have too many programmers/engineers and not enough true , touchy/feely UI designers ? Does Google plan to just live off their brand now ? Concerned Google stockholder . In my opinion , Google was never something more than a great search engine . In an early era where dial-up was more common than broadband , Google built a top-notch engine with a very light UI which made it an immediate favorite amongst a lot of users . What was nice about Google was that it never aspired to be something someone else was , it created its own identity as a very comprehensive search engine . However , offlate , I have started losing faith in Google , especially because their objectives and goals as a company seem very unclear . A chunk of their revenue still comes through ads , and their search engine is really the only intellectual property they have developed from the ground-up , otherwise everything else is either just an acquisition or a bad idea . Google earth was previously keynote , Google Talk has been built upon Jabber which is an open source technology for messaging and these were the `` other '' great ideas besides the search engine , but things like web accelerators and secure connection through VPN are just lame excuses to drive internet traffic through their servers.Another great idea from Google was desktop search , but somehow they never capitalized on the idea , and today MSN has come out tops in this department.At the end of the day , Google isnt running out of ideas , I think they are running out of focus , something that companies like Yahoo have and very well defined ones at that .",0

"If jesus is Lord / God when he died on the cross who kept the universe in order ? Is the trinity false ? Excellent question . But unfortunately , I have yet to hear a good answer . God the Almighty Creator does n't even blink for a second , nonetheless die . If this were true and God died on the cross , then ALL existance would cease.Here 's what makes the trinity questionable : If you have a creature ( i.e . a created being ) , and a third of that creature dies while the other two-thirds are still alive , then that creature has n't really died . All parts would have to die for the creature to be considered dead . So if this applies to a created being , how can it not apply to the Creator ? If a third of God dies , but the other two-thirds are still alive , then that third did n't really die ; especially when he 's resurrected within a number of hours.The fact is that death in itself is a creation . Therefore the dimension of death can not be applied to an infinite entity which exists outside the realm of all creation . i.e . No creator , or any part of a creator , dies.What does that mean anyways ? What does it mean that a third of God has died ? ? ? This can only indicate that the trinity is not true ; it 's merely a pagan practice that has filtered down to blemish the noble message of Prophet Jesus ( peace be upon him ) . ( see link below ) For those who say angels , well who was sustaining the angels in God 's absence ? Did you really hear yourself say that ? ?",0

'' So they learn not to take the chance of hurting feelings or offending someone . Indirect communication is one of the best ways to do this . Also , women 's minds make connections more easily than men 's minds so what men may percieve as indirect may just mean that the woman is engaging in `` web '' thinking rather than the `` linear '' way in which most men think . To help you understand what she 's saying , it is a good idea to just ask questions . Make them non-threatening . A good example would be , `` Can you tell me more about that .

"do i have to send thank you notes for christmas ? The rule is ... if the giver is in a different house from you , you NEED to send one . Do n't just send a blank one though ! Here is a fabulous guide on what to say : There is a six-point formula to the proper thank-you : Learn it , know it , memorize it – and it will never fail you.1 . Greet the Giver Dear Aunt Sally , That ’ s the easy part , but you ’ d be surprised how many people forget it . Dale Carnegie taught us people love to hear their own names and Direct Marketing is sure we also love to read them in ink . That ’ s right , ink . Blue-black is always the number-one choice , but black will suffice in a pinch . Don ’ t let a whimsical marker color be the most stunning part of your note : instead let the words sing without the amplification of rainbow hues . Even if your handwriting is poor , you must still hand-write your notes . Do not type them or , worse , use a word processor . No excuses.2 . Express Your Gratitude Thank you so much for the slippers.This first paragraph seems like it would be the easiest , but it is actually the most complicated . Beware the just writing trap . You are not ‘ just writing to say ’ as in I am just writing to say ; that ’ s stating the obvious . If the giver is reading , clearly you have already written . Therefore use the present-perfect tense , which essentially means write as if whatever you say is happening in the moment.Also – and this is important – never directly mention money . ‘ Thank you for the hundred bucks ’ could instead be ‘ Thank you for your generosity. ’ All cash denominations become ‘ your generosity ’ or ‘ your kindness. ’ If you feel the giver overspent , the farthest you can go is appreciated : ‘ Your generosity is appreciated , ’ or ‘ It is such an extravagant gift – your kindness is appreciated. ’ If you ’ re writing to thank someone for an intangible ( such as them putting you up at their place while you were in town for the weekend ) , first define what the intangible thing is , and then make the gift sound as attractive as possible . In other words , don ’ t say : ‘ Thanks for letting us crash at your place. ’ Instead say : ‘ Thank you for your hospitality. ’ Don ’ t worry if it sounds too simple ; the point of writing the note is to create a simple expression of a heartfelt sentiment.3 . Discuss Use It gets very chilly here in the winter , so they will get a lot of use when winter comes.Say something nice about the item and how you will use it . Let ’ s say it ’ s something you actually love and use incessantly – then say so : ‘ Ever since I got the slippers I have only taken them off to shower and go to work . I ’ d wear them to the office if I thought I could get away with it. ’ But don ’ t lie , even though some etiquette books may tell you it ’ s okay . After all , there ’ s always a truth that can be extracted . Let ’ s say you hate the slippers . How to say thanks ? Find the one thing about them that ’ s nice and discuss it – but don ’ t get carried away . ‘ They are such a lovely shade of blue ’ works , and is more honest than ‘ These slippers make my heart sing like a choir of angels , ’ which is overkill . If it was a gesture , like letting you stay at their place , you can follow the lines of ‘ It ’ s so nice to make a personal connection while traveling . I really appreciated my time with your family. ’ If the gift was cash , allude to how you will use the money , but do not itemize your planned purchases line by line , instead simply say : ‘ It will be a great help when we purchase our new home/toaster/lava lamp/whatever. ’ You can get arty here , but not flowery . It ’ s a fine line . Small , realistic statements like ‘ I put the flowers on the kitchen table and they are still looking fresh and beautiful after a week , ’ or ‘ I don ’ t know which is more fun , actually using the Cuisinart , or reading recipes and thinking I could do that in the Cuisinart ! ’ Having fun is alright , so have at it.4 .

"Explain how spectral observations ( red shift ) have led to the theory of the big bang. ? im in 10th garde and i need a detailed answerthank you Actually Einstein predicted the Big Bang before Hubble found the first observational evidence.Einstein found that in his theory of General Relativity that the universe as a whole should be either expanding or contracting . He did n't like this so he added an extra term the `` cosmological constant '' to balance the equations and have a universe that was not expanding or contracting . That sort of static universe was what was expected in those days.Meanwhile , Edmund Hubble began making observations in the 1920s from the Mt Wilson Observatory of distant `` nebulae . '' He had discovered previosuly that many of this faint blobs , previously thought to be gas clouds , were in fact galaxies like our own Milky Way . This was a big surprise since previosuly the Milky Way was the only galaxy , or what they called at the time , an `` island universe . `` So , it was natural for Hubble to look at the spectra of some of these distant galaxies . What he found was that , except for a couple of very nearby galaxies like M-31 the Andromeda Galaxy , all the other galaxies had shifted spectra . That is , these other galaxies has spectra which were redshifted , indicating that they were moving away from us.Further he found that the fainter galaxies ( which on average are farther away ) had the largest redshifts . This lead to the famous `` Hubble 's Law '' that says that the observed redshift is proportional to the distance a galaxy is from us.Einstein found out about Hubble 's discovery and realized what it meant - the whole universe is expanding . Although naively it looks like everything is moving away from us , all of space is expanding , so that an observor in any galaxy would detect the same thing - that every galaxy is moving away from them.The usual analogy is to think of rasins in rasin bread . As the bread rises all the dough ( space ) expands , so the distance between all rasins ( galaxies ) grows . Thus from any one rasin ( galaxy ) all the rest look like they are moving away.Einstein realized that his `` cosmological constant '' was unneccessary . He famously called it his `` greatest blunder '' and that he could have officially predicted the expansion of the universe before Hubble confirmed it with observations . ( And in fact , before Hubble 's discovery , other scientists like Willem de Sitter and Alexander Friedmann used the equantions of General Relativity to calculate an expanding universe . ) At that point it was realized that if space is expanding that in the past it must have been all bunched up in one spot . Just before Hubble Georges Lemaître realized this and thought that at first there was some sort of `` primaval atom '' from which everything else came from.Fred Hoyle did n't like Lemaitre 's idea at all , not the least of which was because Lemaitre insisted that God started the whole thing . Hoyle developed a rival theory the Steady State universe , and dismissed the other type of ideas as a `` hot big bang . '' Of course Hoyle 's term , meant as a put-down , became the offical name . ( Hoyle 's Steady State Theory was a serious rival to the Big Bang until the 1960s and the discovery of the microwave background . ) It was n't until 1948 that the modern aspects of the Big Bang were proposed by George Gamow and Ralph Alpher . These guys showed that from an initial explosion of compressed everything one would get the correct mixture of hydrogen and helium and other trace elements observed in the whole universe . That is , if one starts from a hot subatomic , compressed mixture and lets it go , it will recombine into the right ratio of atoms . ( Right being the ration actually observed . ) And so it goes from there , to much more observational evidence for the Big Bang , as well as lots of theoretical progress . At the moment we know that the old cyclical idea , that the universe expands and then contracts , is wrong . In fact the universe seems to be accelerating , tha",0

"Do non-smokers have rights too ? Yes , you non-smokers have rights too , but you give them away by allowing : 1 ) Smoking to be LEGAL , & 2 ) By allowing extra taxation on cigarettes to benefit all Americans . When will American ’ s stop being hypocrites to smokers by rapping smokers of their money and health and then yelling at smokers for providing tax money to all of America ? If we truly cared about America we would find ways to make tobacco illegal and give up the revenue from tobacco.PS : I have not had a cigarette for 12 Days . . . No I ’ m not moody from withdrawals , I just think American ’ s are hypocrites when it comes to smokers . Sin/Use taxes are somewhat better than illegalizing sin/use completely . At least then the ills caused by the sin or damage by the use are paid for by those doing the sin/use . Example : Road use..polution.. gas tax , is both a use and sin tax . Still Illegalizing sin is somewhat ( arguably ) better than flaunting immoral activities to our children . Sins will never be black or white issues they will allways be subjective .

"Since reparations has been given due to past crimes against humanity should n't African Americans receive also ? Due to slavery and 400 yr+ of oppression also the unequal treatment of blacks in America due to White supremacy and injustice . Reparations in the United States have generally been limited to the survivors of government harm . Watch your terminology , though - slavery was not a crime until 1865 , since the government permitted slavery and only outlawed it through the Thirteenth Amendment after the Civil War.For instance , the United States paid survivors of Japanese internment programs from WWII . The program , however , was limited to survivors . No survivors of slavery exist today.A current reparations program would be too bizarre to fathom . All African-Americans were not harmed by slavery , after all , since some immigrated to America after slavery , or since some have no slave ancestors . It would be virtually impossible to require proof of slave ancestry , and then to divide some sum proportionately.Additionally , the vague `` 400 yr+ of oppression '' is unhelpful in crafting legislation . Slavery ended . Segregation did exist also , that 's ended for over 50 years now . If you 're problem with `` White supremacy and injustice , '' then I 'm afraid that no amount of money will solve the problem . Instead , educating future generations and winning over hearts and minds is the most effective remedy to injustice .",0

DO NOT OVERPAY YOUR WRESTLERS you just starting to get in the business and alot of small feds have gone out of business because they overpay.You have to eat too , start paying about $ 10 a head but depends on how many people attends your show for example : A . 50 to 100 people=0.00 payB . 101 to 125 people=10.00 payC . 126 10 150 people=15.00 payThis is just a basic round example3 .

"definition of discovery teaching approach ? The discovery method is a teaching technique that encourages students to take a more active role in their learning process by answering a series of questions or solving problems designed to introduce a general concept . In this teaching approach , the instructor guides the student ’ s thought process by posing a series of questions whose responses would lead to the understanding of a concept before it is explicitly stated . “ Children act as detectives as they solve concept-attainment activities in stimulating learning environments . In doing so , they place a newly introduced object in a category that they have previously discovered or identified. ” This teaching method is believed to increase retention of material because the student organizes the new information and integrates it with information that has already been stored .",0

"Why do some states still have barbaric ways and have the death penilty and others do n't ? I notice that there is still legallized murder in some states and none in others . How can a civillized government allow this to happen in any states ? The short answer is that we live in a Democracy and death penalty laws are on the books because people ( or their representatives ) put them there . There are usually four distinct groups of people involved and it cuts across party lines . Large groups favor the death penalty and large groups oppose it for any number of good reasons . Small groups who have lost someone to murder believe that the death penalty is `` too good '' for the perpetrator , but are not allowed to take the law into their own hands . Small groups related to the murderer oppose the death penalty because of shame and the fact that they still love the perpetrator and find good excuses for him/her.On top of all that , sensational murders committed by those who expect to escape punishment spur on society to support the death penalty . Crimes against innocent children are particularly heinous . And news that someone convicted of murder has been proven ( by DNA tests ? ) to be innocent show the weaknesses in our judicial system.The question really is not all that simple . In New York state , the results of a close Governors race was likely determined on the death penalty issue . The winner favored the penalty while the incumbent never used it based on personal beliefs . Changing politics will always be involved . Many will always feel that a barbaric murderer should know that he/she might face a barbaric fate . And some feel that might save innocent lives .",0

"Why does the heavy part of a class ring spin on top when the ring is spun but stationary moves to the bottom. ? When a child 's top is spun , the point is down and the heavy part up while spinning but when it slows down it topples over , the same happens to a class ring when spun . Why ? The rotational energy you impart to the object when spinning overcomes the force of gravity that would topple a stationary object . A total layman 's explanation : A perfect stationary top perfectly balanced will not fall over . In real life though , it 's impossible to perfectly balance a top . It 's shape practically guarantees that its center of gravity will not be directly over the balance point for any practical length of time . Imperfections in the material will cause a slightly uneven weight distribution , air currents will introduce a small force , and mechanical vibrations will be transmitted through the medium the top rests on . The upshot of all this is that as soon as the center of mass is no longer over the resting point , gravity is going to pull the top over . Now gravity has an acceleration of 32 feet per second squared ( if I remember my ancient high school course correctly ) . It can only topple the top at a specific speed . If you spin the top fast enough , any side that gravity tries to `` pull down '' will translate around so quickly that it literally has no time to fall . If you were standing on a planet with a much higher gravity , you 'd have to spin the top far faster to achieve stability , and if you were on the moon , it would spin for a much longer time . Eventually , however , the top starts to slow and the tip will inscribe little circles . That action is called `` precession '' . And of course , eventually the thing drops to the table and the game is all up once it slows enough.Again , that 's a layman 's view of how it works . Some college physics major is probably going to come in here and make my answer look really foolish .",0

"Will road rage occur ? Traveling in a car at the speed of sound , you blow your horn at the car in front of you also traveling at the speed of sound . Will the car in front of you hear the horn ? Will he give you the finger if he does ? The sound will reach the car in front of you . Although it may seem as though it would not , considering that you are already traveling at the speed of sound , therefore you may think the sound waves go as the same speed as your car therefore not traveling any faster than you are and not getting to the car in front of you . However , this is not the case . This can be explained using Einstein 's theory of relativity . Einstein describes `` frames of reference '' and in your frame of reference , you are not moving ; everything else is moving . Everything in your car is stationary relative to everything else , this is why you do n't feel like you 're moving , and if you throw a book sideways , it does n't fly backwards with the speed your vehicle is moving , this is because the car , yourself , and the book are all moving with the same speed your car is moving . They are all stationary relative to each other . When the sound waves are created , they move in all directions at the speed of sound ( 331 m/s ) , so in your frame of reference , they would be moving at 331 m/s away from the car in all directions . This means from the frame of reference of a person standing outside of your car , the sound waves would actually appear to be moving at twice the speed of sound . This is just like if you threw a ball forward out from the car at 15 m/s , it would appear to an outsider to be moving at that speed plus the speed of sound ( well in a vacuum anyway , or before air resistance took over ) To use a better example of these frames of reference , you know that the earth is rotating . It is rotating at 1070 mi/hr at the equator , yet it seems not to be moving at all , it is our frame of reference when we are standing 'still . ' the speed of sound is no different traveling in different directions on the earth because of this rotation.and yes , he would probably give you the finger . I mean , he is going at the speed of sound , how impatient are you ?",0

"I can understand people not believing in God and Christianity or any other religion , but why insult it ? Why is it ok to curse , be mean to people , talk about and exploit sex , etc . in public and everywhere you go , but if you speak of God , Pray , or wear clothing with scriptures or anything like that you are offending people ? Even if you do n't believe in God and religion , look at the people who truly do believe and live their lives by the Word . Look at how they act . They are kind , caring , respectful and they donate money to charities and volunteer for things . So whether or not you think God is real , the people who do have become better people because of their belief . So in my mind 's eye , those who believe with their heart and confess with their mouth Jesus is indeeed our Saviour are 1 : If it 's all real then they are going to spend eternity with the Father 2 : Either way they are really good people.As for me I believe without a doubt but I struggle with living right . I have had a few experiences that made my belief stronger than ever . I still have to work on how I lead my life . Let 's face it -- it 's easier to insult or make fun of believers than to put that mantle on.You know what it 's like -- it 's not called `` the straight and narrow '' for nothing . I would n't say it 's true for all , but for many it 's just a case of not seeing any kind of benefit -- material , I 'm pretty sure -- to justify their committiment of time , let alone sacrifice.Why do you think so many people question God 's lack of intervention in natural disasters or tragic deaths ? These people all think it 's some kind of cause/effect relationship . You screw up -- God bails you out . If things go wrong , there ca n't be a God -- otherwise He 'd have stopped it.So many of these people are just jaded from the bombardment of so much content that they absorb -- TV , movies , the Internet . There 's plenty of crap to catch hold of , I have no doubt.They 're just so busy trying to disprove our beliefs they ca n't bother seeing the kinds of people they insult . As far as that goes , most of these folks see Christians as one big happy Pat Robertson family . Unfortunately , those that speak the loudest get the most attentio.I always figure every post from one of these folks is just another opportunity for me to witness . Maybe 99 times I 'll just be wasting my time . But who knows about the other 1 ? None of us are perfect , but you are certainly walking the right path . Let these lost souls both strengthen your faith and provide you a powerful incentive to keep witnessing God 's love and Jesus ' sacrifice for our sins . Go in peace and go with God.While I stand behind all the words I wrote above , I felt I had to add to this post in reaction to your additonal comments about prayer in school . I do n't know exactly what the context is , but I find it very troubling . As a Christian , I believe prayer to be the most direct link I have with God . But the notion that prayer should somehow be forced upon students or encouraged in a public school is not just unconstitutional but morally repugnant to me . Even voluntary prayer is patently coersive in my opinion . I think you are a well-meaning but misguided person who does need to work more on how you lead your life . A little bit more tolerance for those who do n't share your beliefs would be as welcome as others ' tolerance for yours .",0

"What are the roots of the words in Esperanto ? The grammar itself is extremely easy , although it could have been easier . vocabulary from Romance and Germanic languages ; phonology from Slavic languages As a constructed language , Esperanto is not genealogically related to any ethnic language . Esperanto can be described as `` a language lexically predominantly romanic , morphologically intensively agglutinative and to a certain degree isolating in character '' The phonology , grammar , vocabulary , and semantics are based on the western Indo-European languages . The phonemic inventory is essentially Slavic , as is much of the semantics , while the vocabulary derives primarily from the Romance languages , with a lesser contribution from Germanic . Pragmatics and other aspects of the language not specified by Zamenhof 's original documents were influenced by the native languages of early speakers , primarily Russian , Polish , German , and French.Typologically , Esperanto has prepositions and a pragmatic word order that by default is Subject Verb Object and Adjective Noun . New words are formed through extensive prefixing and suffixing.Esperanto is written with a modified version of the Latin alphabet , including six letters with diacritics : ĉ , ĝ , ĥ , ĵ , ŝ and ŭ ( that is , c , g , h , j , s circumflex , and u breve ) . The alphabet does not include the letters q , w , x , y except in unassimilated foreign names .",0
"what 's with the bermuda triangle ? The Bermuda Triangle is a stretch of the Atlantic Ocean bordered by a line from Florida to the islands of Bermuda , to Puerto Rico and then back to Florida . It is one of the biggest mysteries of our time - that is n't really a mystery . The term `` Bermuda Triangle '' was first used in an article written by Vincent H. Gaddis for Argosy magazine in 1964 . In the article Gaddis claimed that in this strange sea a number of ships and planes had disappeared without explanation . Gaddis was n't the first one to come to this conclusion , either . As early as 1952 George X. Sands , in a report in Fate magazine , noted what seemed like an unusually large number of strange accidents in that region . In 1969 John Wallace Spencer wrote a book called Limbo of the Lost specifically about the triangle and , two years later , a feature documentary on the subject , The Devil 's Triangle , was released . These , along with the bestseller The Bermuda Triangle , published in 1974 , permanently registered the legend of the `` Hoodoo Sea '' within popular culture . Several books suggested that the disappearances were due to an intelligent , technologically advanced race living in space or under the sea . The only problem was that the mystery was more hype than reality . In 1975 a librarian at Arizona State University , named Larry Kusche , decided to investigate the claims made by these articles and books . What he found he published in his own book entitled The Bermuda Triangle Mystery-Solved . Kusche had carefully dug into records other writers had neglected . He found that many of the strange accidents were not so strange after all . Often a triangle writer had noted a ship or plane had disappeared in `` calms seas '' when the record showed a raging storm had been in progress . Others said ships had `` mysteriously vanished '' when their remains had actually been found and the cause of their sinking explained . More significantly a check of Lloyd 's of London 's accident records by the editor of Fate in 1975 showed that the triangle was a no more dangerous part of the ocean than any other . U.S. Coast Guard records confirmed this and since that time no good arguments have ever been made to refute those statistics . So the Bermuda Triangle mystery disappeared , in the same way many of its supposed victims had vanished . Even though the Bermuda Triangle is n't a true mystery , this region of the sea certainly has had its share of marine tragedy . Perhaps the best known one was the story of Flight 19 . The tale of Flight 19 started on December 5th , 1945 . Five Avenger torpedo bombers lifted into the air from the Navel Air Station at Fort Lauderdale , Florida , at 2:10 in the afternoon . It was a routine practice mission and the flight was composed of all students except for the Commander , a Lt. Charles Taylor . The mission called for Taylor and his group of 13 men to fly due east 56 miles to Hens and Chicken Shoals to conduct practice bombing runs . When they had completed that objective , the flight plan called for them to fly an additional 67 miles east , then turn north for 73 miles and finally straight back to base , a distance of 120 miles . This course would take them on a triangular path over the sea . About an hour and a half after the flight had left , a Lt. Robert Cox picked up a radio transmission from Taylor . Taylor indicated that his compasses were not working , but he believed himself to be somewhere over the Florida Keys ( the Keys are a long chain of islands south of the Florida mainland ) . Cox urged him to fly north , toward Miami , if Taylor was sure the flight was over the Keys . Planes today have a number of ways that they can check their current position including listening to a set of GPS ( Global Positioning Satellites ) in orbit around the Earth . It is almost impossible for a pilot to get lost if he has the right equipment and uses it properly . In 1945 , though , planes flying over water had to depend on knowing their st",0

A change of incentives combined with regulation can improve long-term results and corporate ethics . But it won ’ t create moral organizations .,0

"where do southern natives get there accent from . and why do the black people speak different from the white ? By Southern natives , I take it you mean people born and raised in the southern United States ? Many if not most of the original European settlers in that part of the country were from Scotland , Ireland or Wales . This mixed with both African influences and a stand-offishness to the more British speakers of the north eventually lead to the Southern American English ( SAE ) form of speech . Although most African Americans spoke similar to their white counterparts until very recently , an upsurge in differentiation started in the 1950 ’ s and 1960 ’ s which soon separated the speech patterns of many .",0
"Does anyone know anything about Linus Pauling any written work ? ? ? Pauling , Linus Carl ( 1901-1994 ) , American chemist and physicist , whose investigations into the structure of molecules led to discoveries of how chemicals bond.Pauling was born in Portland , Oregon , on February 28 , 1901 , and educated at Oregon State College and the California Institute of Technology . He began to apply his insights into quantum physics as Professor of Chemistry at the institute , where from 1927 to 1964 he made many of his discoveries . By devising techniques such as X-ray and electron diffraction , he was able to calculate interatomic distances and the angles between chemical bonds.During the 1930s Pauling introduced concepts that helped reveal the bonding forces of molecules . The Nature of the Chemical Bond , the result of these investigations , has been a major influence on scientific thinking since it was published in 1939 . Pauling also investigated the atomic structure of proteins , including haemoglobin , and discovered that cell deformity in sickle-cell anaemia is caused by a genetic defect that influences the production of haemoglobin . He was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work . In later years Pauling fought ardently against nuclear weapons testing , warning the public of the biological dangers of radioactive fallout , and presented a petition to the United Nations in 1958 signed by over 11,000 other scientists . In 1962 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , becoming the second person , after Marie Curie , to win two Nobel Prizes.Throughout his scientific career , Pauling followed his creative hunches , no matter how controversial they were . In 1970 , for example , he advocated large doses of vitamin C to treat the common cold—a belief , however , that few medical authorities have endorsed .",0

This would then lead to him feeling guilt sa he had recieved kindness from a man whom his domineering wife wants dead . He had a choice between friendship and marital relations and he chose to obey his wife than risk her leaving him or something of that sort . Also , King Duncan also praised Macbeth for his greatness in battle . all his wife ever said about him was his cowardice in killing King Duncan .

"how does computer work ? A computer is an information-processing machine that works by converting all kinds of information into binary numbers ( ones and zeros ) and then using simple mathematics to make decisions about , or to rearrange , those numbers . There are two things essential to understanding the basics of how a computer works . One is that a computer treats any type of information ( not only numbers but also letters , words , dates , and so on ) as if it consisted simply of binary ones and zeros . For example , a computer can translate the letter “ A ” typed into its keyboard into a string of ones and zeros , such as 1000001 . One reason to do this is that once in binary form , the information can be stored and moved about more easily .",0

"can antigravity be achieved ? Anti-gravity in the context of mainstream physicsNewton 's Law of Gravitation considered gravity to be a force between two objects , causing attraction in proportion to the objects ' mass . Under this interpretation , an object with negative mass would repel ordinary matter , and could be used to produce an anti-gravity effect . Alternatively , depending on the mechanism assumed to underlie the gravitational force , it may seem reasonable to postulate a material that shields against gravity or otherwise interferes with the force . An example of such a material , cavorite , is a major deus ex machina of H. G. Wells ' famous book , The First Men in the Moon , though it should be noted that Cavorite is n't consistent with even a Newtonian view of the universe ( it causes violations of conservation laws ) . Neither negative-mass exotic matter nor a gravity-screening material have been observed experimentally . While the potential existence of exotic matter is still debated , general relativity presents persuasive arguments against the existence of screening materials . Einstein 's theory of general relativity , published in 1915 , supplanted Newton 's model of gravity with an entirely different mechanism - one based entirely on the geometry of the universe . Gravity was no longer a force at all , but simply the consequence of the local slope of the universe in a direction the human eye can not see : time . You stick to the floor not because gravity is pulling you down , but because that is the shortest distance between today and tomorrow . Under this model , gravity in a universe containing only matter with positive mass is purely attractive . No arrangement of ordinary matter can produce an anti-gravity effect . Spacetime geometries corresponding to true anti-gravity in general relativity require negative mass . Some models of anti-gravity claim to derive from general relativity.The model of gravity proposed by the theory of general relativity breaks down under extreme conditions ( too far inside a black hole , and in the very early life of the universe under the big bang model ) . In particular , most physicists believe that at extremely high energies , gravity and the other fundamental forces unify , which would allow gravity to be manipulated in ways that are not readily apparent now . Candidate models for this regime are theories of everything , which attempt to model all four forces ( example : string theory ) , and theories of quantum gravity , which attempt to produce a model of gravity that is consistent with quantum mechanics , though not necessarily unified with the other forces . Some models of anti-gravity claim to be based on quantum gravity models , though the connection of these to mainstream quantum gravity models is often tenuous.Conventional effects that look like anti-gravityMagnetic levitation suspends an object against gravity by use of electromagnetic effects . While visually impressive , this is not an anti-gravity effect . Critics of various alleged anti-gravity devices often suggest that unusual effects observed around them are due to electromagnetism.A tidal force causes objects to move along diverging paths near a massive body ( such as a planet or star ) , producing effects that seem like repulsion or disruptive forces when observed locally . This is not anti-gravity . In Newtonian mechanics , the tidal force is the effect of the larger object 's gravitational force being different at the differing locations of the diverging bodies . In Einsteinian gravity , the tidal force is the effect of the diverging bodies following different paths in the negatively curved spacetime around the larger body . Large amounts of normal matter can be used to produce a gravitational field that compensates for the effects of another gravitational field , though the entire assembly will still be attracted to the source of the larger field . Physicist Robert L. Forward proposed using lumps of degenerate matter to locally compensate for th",0

But the structure of our government is still pretty good , and our Constitution is just fine , thank you . Do n't you wish the current crop of idiots paid attention to it once in awhile ? The problem I see in this country is that the vast majority of voters figure their choices are limited to the two largest parties . Problem is , they have been trading off power trips and making back-room deals between them for so long , that does not give us much in the way of a choice.But we have a strong and promising third party coming up fast : the Libertarian Party . We libertarians believe that a government should be small enough to fit inside the Constitution .

"What all did Abraham Lincoln do in his life ? I have to do a school report and I needed some information about him.E-mail me at caylaellis @ yahoo.com Though he lost 17 of the 19 elections he took part in , the two that he did win , were for Congress and the Presidency ... He epitomized determination ! Among many of his priceless quotations , he said : '' I may be slow , but at least I do n't walk backwards '' ... He was considered quite homely , and when he was accused of being two-faced during a debate with his opponent Steven Douglas , he replied , '' If I had another face , do you think I would be wearing this one ? '' ... ( The crowd loved it ! ) When his best General , Ulysses S. Grant , who at the time , was the only General winning any battles , was accused by his peers of being drunk all the time , he replied , `` Well , find out what he 's drinking , and send him another case of it , on me ! `` ... Lastly , he said , `` If I had one hour to cut down a tree , I would spend 45 minutes sharpening my axe '' ... Additionally , he had to bear the responsibilty of being at the center of our country 's most terrible War ... He wrote one , of what are considered to be the two greatest speeches in recorded history , the `` Gettysberg Address '' .

"where is euthanasia legalized ? authanasia is legalized in Australia Belgium The Netherlands Oregon ( United States ) However , there are two types of euthanasia - active and passive . 1 . Active Euthanasia : a positive action is taken to bring about someone ’ s death e.g . the administering of a deadly injection or the assisting in preparations for a suicide2 . Passive Euthanasia involves a refusal to intervene to change the course of events , where the result is the death of the person.All of these countries support Assisted Euthanasia -a second party ( usually a physician ) participates in bringing about the patient ’ s death , but is not the sole cause of the death .

"What is existentialism ? Existentialism is about the angst of human existence . The existentialist comes to a crisis ( `` The existential crisis '' ) when he realizes the angst of existence , the utter horror of life . There are different ways of responding to this crisis.Soren Kierkegaard says that when one comes to that point , what one must do is take a leap of faith . This is a Christian existentialism , but many existentialists were/are atheists . Such as Jean-Paul Sartre . He wrote a book called Nausee ( Nausea ) about existence . It is very depressing ! But existentialism does not have to be depressing . Some may call Viktor Frankl a happy existentialist . He wrote a WONDERFUL book called Man 's Search for Meaning about his own experiences in the Holocaust . It is all about finding meaning in life . I HIGHLY recommend that book to everyone !",0

"phases of themoon ? The Moon appears to go through phases . In other words , the amount of the Moon that we can see changes over time in a cyclic period that repeats itself approximately once a month . ( The actual period of this cycle is approximately 29.5 Earth days . ) The cause of these phases is the relative positions of the Sun , Earth , and Moon . As seen in the diagram , if the Sun is located off to the right of the picture , the Earth and Moon are illuminated as shown ( the white areas being the lighted areas ) . Notice that no matter what phase the Moon is in , HALF of it is ALWAYS lit by the Sun . ( Which half is always lit ? The half that is facing the Sun . ) The reason that we do not always see a Moon which is half lit is because of our position relative to the Moon and the Sun . As the Moon moves in its orbit , different portions of it appear ( to us ! ) to be lit up as we look at it from Earth . This is why we see lunar phases .",0

This function goes to positive infinity when x approaches 0 from the left , and negative infinity when x approaches 0 from the right . The range of this function is all real numbers .",0

"Antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria are an example of ____________ ? just fill in the blank ... its for a bio AP assignment ... Boy , am I ever glad I 'm done with high school biology where they ask ridiculous , ambiguous fill-in the blank questions like that . I have a degree in biology and I could n't give you a solid answer . It will be a word that you should have been studying in class.Ie. , Adaptation - mutations that give an organism an advantageMutation - alterations in genetic makeupEvolution - changes in organisms over time due to adaptationNatural Selection - conditions which select adaptationsI would go with adaptation , but no guarantees . The concept here is that as we take antibiotics we kill a lot of bacteria , but not all of them . The remaining few that survive are the `` tougher '' ones , at least ones that are n't affected as much by the antibiotics . These remaining bacteria may continue to grow in numbers . If they ever succeed in infecting more people , the antibiotics will now do nothing.P.S ... A lot of people think that bacteria randomly mutate until one of them becomes resistant . This is only part of the story . Antibiotics almost always originate from other bacteria , or some other organism trying to fend off bacteria . These antibiotics are not new , just new to medicine . Bacteria have been resisting these antibiotics for millions of years . Maybe not actively , but somewhere in their past it has probably been encountered . Yet another reason why a one-word answer just does n't cut it .",0

"What is Raggaetone ? Reggaeton is a form of dance music which has become popular with Latin America in youth during the late 1990s and has spread to North American and European audiences during the first few years of the 21st century . Reggaeton ( also spelled with the Spanish accent as Reggaetón , and sometimes as Reguetón in Spanish ) - blends Jamaican music influences of reggae and dancehall with those of Latin America , such as bomba and plena , as well as that of hip hop . The music is combined with rapping ( generally ) in Spanish . Reggaeton has empowered the Spanish Caribbean youth , specifically those of Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic , as well as the Latin American and United States Latino communities , with a musical genre as a voice . More recently it has become an international movement with the help of many from New York 's Latino and Black hip hop community.While it takes influences from hip hop and dancehall , it would be wrong to define reggaeton as the 'Spanish'- or 'Latino'- version of either of these genres ; reggaeton has its own specific beat and rhythm , whereas Latino hip hop is simply hip hop sung by artists of Latino descent . Reggaeton 's distinguishing feature is the Dem Bow beat ( alternately spelled Dembow ) , which originated in a song by Shabba Ranks in the mid-1990s.Reggaeton lyrics tend to be more derived from hip hop than dancehall . Like hip hop , reggaeton has caused controversy due to its often explicit lyrics and alleged exploitation of women [ 1 ] . Further controversy surrounds perreo , a dance with explicit sexual overtones which typically accompanies reggaeton music",0

"why is the Van Allen radiation belts have to surround to earth ? The Van Allen belts have very little to do with the earth 's core as the other answer suggested . They are believed to be created by the eath 's magnetic field interacting with charged particles known as solar wind . To the extent that we believe the earth 's core responsible for creating the earth 's magnetic field , I guess the earth 's core has some relevance . As the solar winds encounter the earth 's magnetic field , the radiation becomes trapped within the field . They are repelled from areas of stronger magnetic field where field lines converge . Two alternative hypotheses have been proposed . Possibly the Van Allen Belts are lefor over from the aurora , and another argument is that they are the result of volcanic activity of the earth . Some scientists beleive that they may have a beneficial effect on the planet providing some protection from solar wind , and that weakening them would harm both electronics and living organisms . there has been a proposal to reduce the charge of the belts , which are a hazard to satellites .",0

"What exactly is antimatter ? Howmuch of it has been produced till today ? Antimatter or contra-terrene matter is matter that is composed of the antiparticles of those that constitute normal matter . If a particle and its antiparticle come in contact with each other , the two annihilate and produce a burst of energy , which results in the production of other particles and antiparticles or electromagnetic radiation . In these reactions , rest mass is not conserved , although ( as in any other reaction ) energy ( E=mc² ) is conserved.Scientists in 1995 succeeded in producing antiatoms of hydrogen , and also antideuteron nuclei , made out of an antiproton and an antineutron , but no antiatom more complex than antideuterium has been created yet . In principle , antiatoms of any element could be built from readily available sources of antiparticles . Such antiatoms would have exactly the same properties as their normal-matter counterparts . The production of antielements in bulk quantities seems unlikely to ever become achievable , however.Positrons and antiprotons can individually be stored in a device called a Penning trap , which uses a combination of magnetic field and electric fields to hold charged particles in a vacuum . Two international collaborations , ATRAP and ATHENA , used these devices to store thousands of slowly moving antihydrogen atoms in 2002 . It is the goal of these collaborations to probe the energy level structure of antihydrogen to compare it with that of hydrogen as a test of the CPT theorem . One way to do this is to confine the antiatoms in an inhomogenous magnetic field ( one can not use electric fields since the antiatoms are neutral ) and interrogate them with lasers . If the anti-atoms have too much kinetic energy they will be able to escape the magnetic trap , and it is therefore essential that the anti-atoms be produced with as little energy as possible . This is the key difference between the antihydrogen that ATRAP and ATHENA produced , which was made at very low temperatures , and the antihydrogen produced in 1995 which was moving at a speed close to the speed of light.Antimatter/matter reactions have practical applications in medical imaging , such as positron emission tomography ( PET ) . In some kinds of beta decay , a nuclide loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron ( in the same event , a proton becomes a neutron , and neutrinos are also given off ) . Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a cyclotron and are widely generated for medical use.Antiparticles are created everywhere in the universe where high-energy particle collisions take place , such as in the center of our galaxy , but none has been detected that is residual from the Big Bang , as most normal matter is . [ 1 ] The unequal distribution between matter and antimatter in the universe has long been a mystery . The solution likely lies in the violation of CP-symmetry by the laws of nature ; see baryogenesis.how much produced it is on and on and on",0
"How do you change direction when swimming freestyle in a pool ? You know what I mean : good swimmers just kind of do a 180 and then kick off in the opposite direction . It 's clear that you have to flip over and turn over , but I find it tricky . I 'm generally very coordinated , so I think I just need some tips . A flip turn is done by basically gliding into the wall and flipping into a back-stroke glid and eventually turning back onto your front . With your momentum carrying you into the wall , tuck your head under so your upper torso will be on its back . Your legs will follow over and the momentum will carry your legs into the wall . In the glide position on your back slowly turn back onto your front . As you improve and get your orientation you will be able to flip while on your side , and will be able to more efficiently do your turn . Things to watch when turning , work on your timing coming into the wall . You will need to be able to judge when you should start your flip turns , that 's what the T on the lane lines are for . Keep from going to deep when doing your turns . Keep your body stream lined into the wall and coming off the wall . Think of your body as hinged at your hips and keep both halves extended when flipping - only the hinge bends . Good luck .",0

When light is refracted off of droplets of water it enables you to see all the colors that make up white light ( sunlight , even light from bulbs . ) creating what people more commonly refer to as a rainbow .

The bottom half is harder to see , but it is there . The reason rainbows do n't look like that when we see them outside is because we are too low to the ground to see the rest .",0

It takes 4yrs wherever you go , and you can go straigt to gradschool depending on how far you want to take it , but you need at least a four year degree to get a decent job . A Masters degree will be another 2yrs , and a PhD another 4-5yrs . The more schooling you finish , the more you 'll be paid , basically . But also the more responsibility you will have . With a BS you can get a job doing bench chemistry at a variety of businesses , including pharmaceutical companies , cosmetics , and personal hygeine companies among others . You 'll start out at a decent wage and work your way up . Myself , I decided I did n't want to be in the lab , and got into the office of a company that deals with rubber chemistry . They were very happy to have my chemical background in the office . It just depends on what you 're looking for.As for requirements , obviously each shool varies . You will need , of course , a highschool degree or equivalent . Your GPA will need to be C+/B- or above . Schools like to see above average test scores as well ( take both the SATs and the ACTs , as well as the highschool proficiency exams ) .

"Why are people so obssesed with Howard Stern ? I admitt , he is entertaining to watch ... but why all the posts/questions about him ? It 's probably because of the huge media attention about Howard leaving terrestrial radio -- you know , traditional AM/FM radio stations -- in favor of satellite programming service Sirius . The deal is an enormous one ( reportedly $ 500 million ) and there is a tremendous amount of attention being paid to the change . His last day on traditional radio was today , and he will launch his satellite programs in about three weeks.Additonally , Howard is one of the greatest self-promoters around . He 's spent the past year since the deal was announced talking about his move , often on his terrestrial network show . It has created a lot of friction and , of course , more attention about Howard and his big move.I do n't know if his fans , or the public in general , are more obsessed with Howard now that he 's making this change . It will allow him to do whatever he wants , as opposed to the obscenity restrictions enforced on broadcast radio by the FCC . I think it 's some of both . While many of his fans ca n't wait for Howard to do literally anything , I think that a lot of hoopla is just all the hype . He 's a national figure getting this huge deal for what is essentially an unknown quantity in Sirius . There have been some real gains in their susbscriptions as they approach the launch , but whether they will bring in enough only time -- and Howard 's popularity -- will tell .",0

The fuel problem is only temporary . We need to capture perhaps 1 % of 1 % of the sun 's solar energy to meet all our needs . Technology is rapidly improving . Soon there will be available relatively cheap plastic foil photovoltaic cells to convert solar energy to electrical energy . The technology already exists . The roofs of most buildings will be covered with them . Then we will still need a little oil to lubricate our bikes and hedge clippers . The problem is to obtain and maintain world peace until then .

I listed a site that had an answer for you . It gives several suggestions to try . Be careful though ... do n't get sucked into a scam . If it sounds to good to be true it probably is . Just know that you are looking at a long road , but if you enjoy singing it should be a fun road to travel . You really have to have a passion for music to make it . Good luck to you ! ! !",0
"At what age do you think , a boy should should already know how to swim ? It 's different for everyone . I do n't like the idea of being too forceful , but I also do n't like the idea of leaving it completely up to the child . Some kids will NEVER try if not pushed a bit . A class would definitely help- sometimes being taught by someone who 's not a parent or close relative can speed things along . People develop at different rates , but generally speaking , a child can easily learn how to swim by the age of 5 .",0

"Who do you like better Green Day or Linkin Park ? I like Linkin Park . Linkin Park and Green Day ( exept for the album `` American Idiot '' ) are pretty much all I listen to . Here 's why I like Linkin Park the best : > No cussing ( the s-word was on the song `` High Voltage '' , but that 's still not as much as Green Day ) . > The lyrics are much deeper , by far. > The music videos are very creative > So far , Linkin Park has n't had to do any covers of old songs to use as filler on albums , whereas Green Day has done , like , 10. > The musicians themselves are interesting and well rounded people . Mr. Hahn directs the videos , Mike draws/creates album art and can play piano and guitar , as well as write great songs and do his thing as emcee , Phoenix can play violin and cello as well as do his thing as bassist for the band.On , a personal bias , Linkin Park is better because they are ! Plus , they have Chester Bennington . He has a huge vocal range ( whispering > whining > singing > shouting > screaming ) , and could probably sing a song from any musical genre . Of course , he 's a complete psyco , but that makes him an interesting person . And , I can completely relate to some of their songs ( which sometimes freaks me out , on certain songs ) . Also , the songs are louder and more in-your-face than Green Day 's . Sometimes , I like to kick back with a little bit of Green Day , because they 're my second favorite band ( although I ca n't explain why ... ) .",0

"Would Bush eventually be impeached ? ? His spying has taken a vicious turn.Who knows what cat might come out of the bag in the coming days ? ? Unfortunately , since both houses of the legislature are controlled by Republicans , the liklihood of President Bush being impeached is virtually nil.In order for him to be impeached , the House of Representatives would need to file articles of impeachment , which are passed by a simple majority . In order for this to occur , some Republican representatives would have to cross the aisle and vote with the Democratic minority . In the remote chance that this would happen , the case would be forwarded to the Senate for trial.Once in the Senate , two thirds of the present Senators would be required . Once again , since the Republicans control this part of the House , the liklihood of an actual impeachment occuring is remote at best.And on another note , punishment is determined by the Senate . They can choose to remove him from office , or do nothing should he be impeached . Again , the odds of anything happening are slim and none.While it 's nice to dream , we 're going to have to wait for President Bush to leave office in eary 2009 , unless the political landscape shifts drastically between now and then.Read the Wiki below for more info .",0

Usual protocol is for the examiner to ask what medications the subject has taken . If the examiner does not ask , volunteer the information . The test itself takes readings of blood pressure , respiration , etc. , which may be affected by the medication , and therefore throw off the results.The real question is what the mental disorder is , and whether it would affect the ability of the subject to tell truth from fiction . The polygraph is designed to show when the subject is stating something the subject knows is untrue . If the subject `` knows '' men from Mars are controlling his thoughts , he will show as truthful when asked if he knows whether there is life on Mars .",0

"what 's ur idea about iran and NUCLEUS energy ? The idea to contain nuclear proliferation is to have as few countries as possible have atomic weapons .

A number of countries will assist other countries in constructing a peace nuclear energy plant.The problem occurs when a country wants to develop their own nuclear industry , purportedly for peaceful purposes and their government is not stable and their plans for such development are clearly for weapons development . Iran falls into this latter category.Russia has offered to develop for them ( on Russian soil ) the nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes and Iran has turned this down . They want nuclear weapons and they already have the missile systems which deliver them at least as far as Europe . They support the destruction of Israel and it is a surety that if they had such weapons they would use them.They will be helped to have atomic energy plants for peaceful purposes , they will not be allowed to have an atomic weapons development program . .",0

So , according to the jewish view , salvation is truly for every good-doer or do-gooder in the world , regardless of faith or heritage.However , for a more in depth discussion , this question is quite tricky . First and foremost , the term `` salvation '' or in hebrew , Yeshua , does not relate to personal salvation , heaven or hell etc.It is not an individualistic concept , but is more specifically used in reference to deliverance from exile , a future messianic era where moshiach , lit . meaning `` an anointed one '' , will bring peace to the world and lead the entire jewish nation to congregate in israel at the future third temple . While there is no temple , the jews are considered a scattered people . This future period is a time of peace for everyone . It is not exclusionary . The world will presumably be business as usual . But people , enlightened by a high ethical and moral understanding , will get along better with each other . And war and strife and fear will not be a staple of daily life ( as they are now , during this period of exile ) . Thus it will be a time of deliverance from persecution and plague for everyone alike.As for going to heaven vs. hell , judaism teaches us not to focus our energies on this aspect of existence so that we do n't constantly think about getting rewarded ( see ethics of our fathers ) . And rather do good deeds for the sake of doing good deeds.All in all , according to judaism , if you 're a good person , you 're going to heaven !",0

"How do they arrive at the number that represents the DJIA ? What is meant by it is up points ? How is the dow jones industrials avg . calculated and when they say it is up so many points what does that mean ? Nice description on ameritrade.com ... ..One of the best-known market indicators , the Dow Jones Industrial Average , is comprised of 30 leading companies . Calculated by adding the prices of these 30 stocks , the Dow is now considered a figure that indicates the general state of the market . Originally , the Dow divided the sum of the prices of the 30 stocks by 30 , giving a true average . However , to be consistent every time a stock split or paid a dividend , the number 30 had to be adjusted . Now , over 100 years later , the sum of the prices of the 30 stocks is divided by a number less than one ! Since a $ 1 movement in the price of a $ 100 stock counts equally with a $ 1 movement in the price of a $ 20 stock , the Dow Jones is considered a price weighted index.Charles Dow designed the average to represent the current business market , which in 1896 included industries such as sugar , leather , tobacco , gas , rubber and coal . Today the DJIA is led by retailers , oil , technology , pharmaceutical and entertainment companies . The only company on the original list that is still included today is General Electric .",0

"little white lies and white magic ... why is white perceived as 'good ' ? black magic relates to destruction and sacrifice , but 'white ' magic is the work of growth and creation . a little 'white ' lie is usually regarded as okay , but lying in general is looked down upon . in both cases , why is 'white ' perceived as good ? where did this way of categorizing things come from ? is there a religious reason for this ? First of all little “ white ” lies are only acceptable to some in the general population . Many still believe that all lies are contrary to best behavior . But as an example , I get your point.The association of white with good and black with bad predates recorded history . This generalization is almost universally true in all cultures.The best possible answer goes back to the time before artificial nocturnal lighting . Humans are visual creatures . We tend to rely upon and believe what our visual system records . The eye itself has two kinds of receptors . These are called Rods and Cones . The Rods are more sensitive and give us the shades of gray in “ night vision. ” The Cones respond to colors and are more active during the day . Humans see more clearly and with better spatial acuity during daylight hours.White is a mixture of colors and is only perceived during the day . Daylight = Better vision = Good . At night , when the rods take over : Night = Poor vision = Bad.For a very detail report on vision , try the site below :",0

"Why is The ocean salty ? [ be specific ] ? All water , even rain water , contains dissolved chemicals which scientists call `` salts . '' But not all water tastes salty . Water is fresh or salty according to individual judgment , and in making this decision man is more convinced by his sense of taste than by a laboratory test . It is one 's taste buds that accept one water and reject another.A simple experiment illustrates this . Fill three glasses with water from the kitchen faucet . Drink from one and it tastes fresh even though some dissolved salts are naturally present . Add a pinch of table salt to the second , and the water may taste fresh or slightly salty depending on a personal taste threshold and on the amount of salt held in a `` pinch . '' But add a teaspoon of salt to the third and your taste buds vehemently protest that this water is too salty to drink ; this glass of water has about the same salt content as a glass of sea water.Obviously , the ocean , in contrast to the water we use daily , contains unacceptable amounts of dissolved chemicals ; it is too salty for human consumption . HOW SALTY IS THE OCEAN ? ... How salty the ocean is , however , defies ordinary comprehension . Some scientists estimate that the oceans contain as much as 50 quadrillion tons ( 50 million billion tons ) of dissolved solids.If the salt in the sea could be removed and spread evenly over the Earth 's land surface it would form a layer more than 500 feet thick , about the height of a 40-story office building . The saltiness of the ocean is more understandable when compared with the salt content of a fresh-water lake . For example , when 1 cubic foot of sea water evaporates it yields about 2.2 pounds of salt , but 1 cubic foot of fresh water from Lake Michigan contains only one one-hundredth ( 0.01 ) of a pound of salt , or about one sixth of an ounce . Thus , sea water is 220 times saltier than the fresh lake water . What arouses the scientist 's curiosity is not so much why the ocean is salty , but why it is n't fresh like the rivers and streams that empty into it . Further , what is the origin of the sea and of its `` salts '' ? And how does one explain ocean water 's remarkably uniform chemical composition ? To these and related questions , scientists seek answers with full awareness that little about the oceans is understood.Illustration : Sources of salts in the ocean.THE ORIGIN OF THE SEA ... In popular language , `` ocean '' and `` sea '' are used interchangeably . Today 's seas are the North and South Pacific , North and South Atlantic , Indian and Arctic Oceans and the Antarctic waters or seas.Scientists believe that the seas are as much as 500 million years old because animals that lived then occur as fossils in rocks which once were under ancient seas . There are several theories about the origin of the seas , but no single theory explains all aspects of this puzzle . Many earth scientists agree with the hypothesis that both the atmosphere and the oceans have accumulated gradually through geologic time from some process of `` degassing '' of the Earth 's interior . According to this theory , the ocean had its origin from the prolonged escape of water vapor and other gases from the molten igneous rocks of the Earth to the clouds surrounding the cooling Earth . After the Earth 's surface had cooled to a temperature below the boiling point of water , rain began to fall and continued to fall for centuries . As the water drained into the great hollows in the Earth 's surface , the primeval ocean came into existence . The forces of gravity prevented the water from leaving the planet.SOURCES OF THE SALTS ... Sea water has been defined as a weak solution of almost everything . Ocean water is indeed a complex solution of mineral salts and of decayed biologic matter that results from the teeming life in the seas . Most of the ocean 's salts were derived from gradual processes such the breaking up of the cooled igneous rocks of the Earth & # 39",0

"Do you think children have a preference for one parent over another ? I was observing kids and their parents in a public location . I noticed the little girls were walking hand in hand with their father and the little boys were walking with their mother . I was wondering if boys tend to gravitate to their moms , while girls gravitate to their dads . I think parents tend to have a natural protection type sheild over the opposite sex offspring . Like a daddy and his little girl , there is nobody who can come in between them until sweet sixteen when daddy 's cleaning the shotgun , while mothers want their sons to turn out to be men of honor that women will want while he still has respect . I feel children will gravitate towards the nicer parents because their minds are so simple they respond to the parent who is nicer . If you left a jar full of sugar in front of a 4 year old it would be gone in a matter of minutes because they do n't know any reason why they should n't eat it all . When a parent scolds a child the child is instantaneously resentful because they have no idea of the long term effects , does that make sence ? ?",0

"What 's the difference between an Agnostic and an Atheist ? I wrote the following in a blog on God 's coherence ( source below ) : -- -- -- -- -- -- Before I begin , I ’ m going to define some terms for the purpose of this discussion . These are by no means concrete and we can define them further if need be.Atheist : Someone without the belief in God . It is not necessarily a position where the person says affirmatively that God does not exist . Atheist is a general statement about a non belief in any God concept.Hard Atheist : This is the person who says that God does not exist , affirmatively.Weak Atheist : This is a person who does not feel that there is any quality evidence for the existence of God . They do not rule the concept of God out definitely , but they see no reason to believe in any of the Gods they know of.Agnostic : Agnosticism is not a position on whether one believes in God or not , it is a position on whether one believes that it is possible to know positively whether God exists or not . Additionally it ’ s a position on whether God can be known through experience .",0

"Police Officer Detectivelost job , unable to move on . Anyone have any suggestions ? Detective for 14 years with same City . Since then , he is unable to function b/c he feels his life is gone . No matter what I say to encourage , he has not been able to move on . This was 6 years ago and has undergone deep therapy and medications . Appreciate any advice from any one that has been through this . Thank you so much ! That 's a tough thing for anyone to go through and probably more so for a police officer or detective . That is a high stress and emotionally draining job I would think . Does he go out or stay in a lot ? If he stays in a lot , try to get him to go out . He needs to do things to build his self confidence again . Going to the gym , join a group that does things he has similiar interests in , take a couse at a local college just for fun ex : writing , art , etc . You did n't say if he could return to that work in another city or not . That might be one option . There are many other jobs he could get with his vast skills and experience and he could take some courses at a college to add to his skills and head his vocation in another direction . He could also volunteer to go to schools and talk to children . I would not push him to get a job until he is feeling better about himself and when that time comes , I would suggest a part-time one . Let him know that he has the power to turn a bad turn of events into a positive and meaningful one . He is fortunate to have such a caring and concerned friend like you .

"what are the seven wonders of the world ? This gets asked daily ... .The 7 wonders of the ancient world : * The Great Pyramid of Giza It is the one and only Ancient Wonder which does not require a description by early historians and poets . It is the one and only Ancient Wonder that does not need speculations concerning its appearance , size , and shape . It is the oldest , yet it is the only surviving of the Seven Ancient Wonders . It is the Great Pyramid of Giza . * The Hanging Gardens of Babylon Some stories indicate the Hanging Gardens towered hundreds of feet into the air , but archaeological explorations indicate a more modest , but still impressive , height . * The Statue of Zeus at Olympia This is a statue of the God in whose honor the Ancient Olympic games were held . It was located on the land that gave its very name to the Olympics . At the time of the games , wars stopped , and athletes came from Asia Minor , Syria , Egypt , and Sicily to celebrate the Olympics and to worship their king of Gods : Zeus . * The Colossus of Rhodes The island of Rhodes was an important economic centre in the ancient world . It is located off the southwestern tip of Asia Minor where the Aegean Sea meets the Mediterranean . The capitol city , also named Rhodes , was built in 408 B.C * The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus Eight hundred years after its destruction , the magnificent Temple of Artemis at Ephesus , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , had been completely forgotten by the people of the town that had once held it in such pride… * The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is the burial place of an ancient king . Yet the Mausoleum is different - so different from the Pyramid that it earned its reputation - and a spot within the list - for other reasons . Geographically , it is closer to the Temple of Artemis ... And it was the beauty of the tomb rather than its size that fascinated its visitors for years . * The Pharos of Alexandria ( The Lighthouse of Alexandria ) Of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , only one had a practical use in addition to its architectural elegance : The Lighthouse of Alexandria . For sailors , it ensured a safe return to the Great Harbor . For architects , it meant even more : it was the tallest building on Earth . And for scientists , it was the mysterious mirror that fascinated them most ... The mirror which reflection could be seen more than 50 km ( 35 miles ) off-shore.Of those , opnly the Pyramids remain today.There are more modern wonders : * Great Pyramid of Giza* Great Wall of China* Taj Mahal* Serengeti Migration* Galapagos Islands* Grand Canyon* Machu PicchuModern world : * Channel Tunnel* CN Tower* Empire State Building* Golden Gate Bridge* Itaipu Dam* Netherlands ' Tidal Defences* Panama CanalNatural wonders : * Grand Canyon* Great Barrier Reef* Harbor of Rio de Janeiro* Mount Everest* Northern Lights* Paricutín volcano* Victoria FallsUnderwater wonders : PalauBelize Barrier ReefGreat Barrier ReefDeep-Sea VentsGalapagos IslandsLake BaikalNorthern Red Sea",0

Lent is a time period where most Catholics choose something to give up ( often sweets , dessert , porn , gambling ) that they tend to indulge in . It is a period of 40 days when Catholics remember the 40 days Jesus fasted in the desert and his ultimate sacrifice at the end of Lent , Good Friday . Marti Gras ( french for Fat Tuesday ) has traditionally become the time for celebration as a last big fling before Lent arrives and people try to restrict themselves more . Also , during Lent , Catholics are supposed to avoid meat other than fish on fridays . On Ash Wednesday , Catholics go to a church service during which the entire congregation processes up to have the priest place ashes on their forehead as a reminder that `` of dust we were made and to dust we shall return '' and our own mortalities .",0

"Is body odor really an aphrodisiac ? Here 's some text from a 2002 study reported in Neuroendrocrinology Letters that indicates male pheremones ( at the heart of `` body odor '' ) may have a positive attractiveness effect to a majority of women.Previous research has revealed that natural and synthetic pheromones can enhance ratings of opposite sex attractiveness . The present study investigated the effects of exposure to male axillary secretions on female ratings of the sexual attractiveness of male stimuli . Thirty-two female undergraduates , half of whom were contraceptive pill users , rated male vignette characters and photographs of male faces on aspects of attractiveness . On two separate study days , corresponding to different phases of their menstrual cycle , stimuli were presented while exposed to male axillary pheromones and under a control condition ( no pheromone ) . The order of testing was balanced with respect to pheromone/control condition and menstrual cycle phase . Pheromone exposure resulted in significantly higher attractiveness ratings of vignette characters and faces . Use of the contraceptive pill or menstrual cycle phase had equivocal effects on some vignette items and neither had any influence on female ratings of male facial attractiveness . The results of this study suggest that exposure to natural male axillary pheromones can significantly enhance female perceptions of various aspects of male attractiveness. -- -- -There 's no question that overt and extreme body odor is repellent to many ( and certainly it can be ! ) -- especially since we 've been trained by countless advertisements to find it so . However , it 's an evolutionary adaptation of some kind , which ( certainly in the pre-bath eras ) must have operated as a signal of some kind to females : of health , of strength , of non-sickness perhaps .",0
What was the 17th president of the united states ? Andrew Johnson . He was Lincoln 's Vice-President and became President after Lincoln was assassinated . He was born in North Carolina and moved to Tennessee . He was a member of House of Representatives from Tennessee and stayed in that post after Tennessee 's succession . He was made military governor of Tennessee in 1862 and Lincoln nominated him as Vice President despite the fact that he was a Southern Democrat.He had many fights with the socalled Radical Republicans over reconstruction . They overrode hos veto on the Civil Rights Act establishing blacks as Citizens and forbidding discrimination . Congress also passed the 14th Amendment establishing equal rights against Johnson 's opposition . They passed laws Governing reconstruction and impeached Johnson for sacking the Secretary of War Edwin Stanton with him surviving by a vote . Johnson was reelected as Senator for Tennessee in 1875 and died a few months later .,0
"How can there be so many people who do not believe in our current war ( here on yahoo alone ) yet we 're in a war How do we have a representative democracy yet most of the people i know do not agree with what our leader is doing ? It does not seem democratic Judging by the last two elections it is evident that the voice of the people no longer exists.What you are currently witnessing is the sad truth of how corrupt individuals have overthrown a good working government and turned it into a dictatorship through manipulation.Also another BIG misunderstanding is most people believe that the United States is a Democracy when in fact it is not !

Why is it if we blow on hot soups or other food we tend to cool it a bit Temperatures of hot foods decrease as the foods steam ( therefore giving OFF heat , and retaining less heat ) .

"A daughter marries a father and her mother marries his son . what 's the relationship between the offsping 's ? ? Wow , weird how many people jump to this being incest and going on about the DNA problems . There is no incest here people ! ! !

The only relationship is through marriage.If both couples have a girl ( for ease lets say sally and jane ) then I think that would make them each others cousin , niece and aunt.Sally would be pauls sister and so the aunt to any offspring of pauls . This also makes any offspring of her brother pauls her niece or nephew ( obviously ) . Jane is marys sister and so the same is true , she will be aunt to any of marys offspring hence we have the relationship Aunt and niece for both children to each other . They are also however the grandchildren of each couple . Jane is the grandchild of Mary and John and sally is the grandchild of Betty and paul and since the only relationship I can think of between grandchildren normally is cousins I think this term applies here as well .",0
"I just bought my nephews a used stereo microscope ( AO 570 , 7x to 42x power ) . What are some fun things to view ? They are wanting a telescope , but at their age ( 10 and 11 ) , I thought they might have more fun looking at various things under a microscope . This scope has an excellent light ( 48 LED circle ) and the lenses are perfectly clear.I 'm afraid , though , that they might get bored pretty quickly if I do n't think of some things to have ready for them to look at . A coin at 42x is interesting , and so is a fly , but I need a LOT more things lined up if you have any suggestions . Wanting them to see things under the scope that they would never know about , even if it is `` everyday '' things.Thanks . Do n't forget that your samples must be small and THIN ( flat ) . If the sample is too big/thick then no light will pass through to the lenses.Most things are best viewed after mounting them in a drop of water under a cover slip.1 . Crystals of salt , icing sugar , etc.2 . Fibres of cotton , wool , synthetics , string , etc.3 . The torn edges of paper.4 . The individual dots of colour from non-glossy pictures . You will probably have to add a bit more illumination from above the sample for this by shining a light onto it ( e.g . desk light ) .5 . Leaf 'skeletons'.6 . Living leaves - from a potted plant ( e.g . a 'spider plant ' ) bend the leaf and clip it between two slides . ( Additional top illumination needed. ) 7 . The thin 'skin ' from between the 'leaves ' of an onion ( onion epidermis ) .8 . The edge of a razor blade or sharp knife ( with top illumination ) .9 . Strands of spider webs.10 . Dust.11 . By gently using a potato peeler you can make thin sections of all sorts of plant parts . Usually only the very edges of these sections are suitable for viewing . You might like to stain plant samples with a drop of iodine ( use instead of water ) under the cover slip.12 . If you have a wood-plane then make thin samples of different types of wood. ( P.S . Forgive my UK spelling )",0

Much of what the government does is to brainwash the citizens into thinking that the what the government is telling them to do is really their choice .

"What items do I need for winter camping to stay warm ? A nice pair of silk long johns is a good place to start . Other little treats for yourself include down clothing , they even make pants . I have a pair of down booties for use in the sleeping bag . Other little clothing tidbits . Wear a hat at all times , even sleeping . You can also sleep with a warm water bottle . Some cautions with this : make sure you know whether the bottle leaks and Nalgene 's are notoriously leaky , if you or your bag gets wet , you may be having a harder time keeping warm . If so you can contain it in a ziplock bag or a roll down velcro closure bag . If the water is too hot , you should put it in a sock or something to keep from burning your skin . My hiking buddy/co worker went to bed with a hot water nalgene between his thighs one night . He thought that was clever because a LOT of blood passes through there and warm blood travels to other parts of the body , warming them . But he woke up with blisters on his thighs ... dangerously close to the family jewels . Last word about hot water bottle , if you use a collapsible canteen or bottle , make sure you fill it allllll the way up , because even then your bottle will cave in as the water cools down . At the very least you want to minimize this so you do n't ruin your bottle . If the bottle cools this way , it will never hold as much as it used to.A good camping mat . The closed cell foam ones that roll up are cheap and effective and very lightweight , the next step up is the self inflating ones but they are heavier . And you can buy covers for those inflating mats that convert them into a chair.You need to dress warm . The most effective thing in my opinion , and also more versatile , is to dress in multiple light layers . In the winter , I wear about 8 layers in the coldest weather ... long john shirt , tee shirt , maybe a button down shirt , a fleece vest , as many fleece crewneck tops ( the fuzzy polartec type , not sweathshirt fleece ) as I can pile on , and my rain jacket . The good news is that if I can add or remove pieces at will until I am perfectly comfortable . IF you go the other route of a couple indoor layers and then one big poofy piece you need to understand the principles of loft , which includes your sleeping bag.Loft is the way insulation in a comforter , parka , or sleeping bag works . They create tiny little air pockets around you and hold YOUR OWN body heat in them . IF you have a lot of clothing between you and the insulating item , you will actually defeat the purpose of the item because you insulate the item FROM your body heat . This is why many things are true : it is better to sleep with fewer clothing items when you want to be warmer in the bag . It is also important not to compromise loft by choosing an item that does n't fit your body and causes you to squash it from the inside out , or with a bunch of heavy layers on top of it to squash it from the outside in . If you compress your item too much , even in storage , or in your pack or its stuff sack , there are fewer air pockets formed and the item does n't work as well.SO choose ONE dressing strategy and know how to apply it.Other important facts : All the things discussed so far are only ways to insulate yourself . They are not generating any heat on their own . To do that , you need to DRINK plenty of water , and you need to EAT , warm foods that are high in sugars and fats are excellent , and you need to MOVE . A bedtime snack can be anything from a candy bar to a stick of butter , NO kidding ! A bedtime activity could be a couple minutes jumping up and down , then one last go at the fire . AND YOU MUST DRINK WATER . Even if you ca n't stand cold liquids . EVEN IF you do n't want to be up all night peeing . Your body needs the water to circulate the blood , and to metabolize food , both of which assist you in staying warm . Another thing you need to know about water is that both dehydration and hypothermia have the early warning sign of disorientation and confusion . The trouble is , if YOU are the one",0

Is there a price to be paid for this trend ? Has anyone done a study analyzing mental health in reference to the number of sexual partners a woman has ? Um , i strongly disagree with the person above me . But , the thing is , i too have not heard of a specific study done to analyze the mental health of women in relation to the number of sexual partners she has had . However , what i do know from speakers in various organizations , tell me that there is a real link to guilt and depression with the number of sex partners she has had in her life . Guilt when her husband knows that she has given away the gift reserved for husbands . ALthough her husband might not feel it 's a big deal , and has told her that , she still feels insecure . Depression may not be a direct cause of the number of sex partners , but it sure is related . Because when women have more sex partners , she increases her risk of becoming pregnant and contracting an STD with each partner she has . So , in the likelihood that she has become pregnant , she would most probably go for an abortion . And after the first abortion , she would be more likely to have more than one abortion . Increased abortions and HPV lead to cervical cancer and no children . And that leads to depression . It 's a sad state of affairs , but that is why more women are finding it hard to conceive and gets depressed because of it .",0

"name the us possessions and territories ? A History of United States Insular Areas : How the Relationships Began From 1899 to 1941 , Guam was under U.S . Naval Administration . At the outbreak of World War II , the Japanese seized Guam and occupied the island for two and a half years . American forces recaptured Guam in July 1944 , and the U.S . Naval Administration resumed responsibility when peace returned.In 1950 , the U.S. Government enacted the Guam Organic Act , conferring U.S. citizenship on the people of Guam and establishing local self-government . Under the Organic Act of 1950 , the Secretary of the Interior assumed administrative responsibility for Guam , formerly vested in the Secretary of the Navy.The United States purchased the Virgin Islands for $ 25 million from Denmark in 1917 . The Virgin Islands were placed under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy until they were transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1931.Interior 's relationship with other U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands stemmed from a post-World War II trusteeship . The Northern Mariana Islands , the Marshall , Palau , Yap , Kosrae , Chuuk and Pohnpei Islands were grouped into the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands ( TTPI ) by the United Nations in 1947 . Under the Trusteeship Agreement with the U.N. Security Council , the United States exercised administrative jurisdiction over the TTPI.The Navy administered the TTPI until 1951 , when that authority was given to the Secretary of the Interior . During those initial years of authority , the Secretary of the Interior exercised broad administrative authority in all the insular areas . Chief executives of the insular governments were appointees of the President or the Secretary and the Secretary had the legal authority to supervise and give binding directions to them.However , this is no longer the case . Popularly elected legislatures ( Guam-1950 , USVI-1954 , American Samoa-1961 , and the CNMI-1979 ) and governors ( Guam and USVI 1971 , American Samoa 1978 , the CNMI , 1979 ) were established . Each of the U.S. insular areas has become responsible for the administration of local government functions . Although the Congress has placed with the Secretary , certain continuing budget and program coordination authority and responsibility concerning U.S. insular affairs , the local governments are not entities of the Department , nor are they agencies or instrumentalities of the Federal Government.Except for CNMI , which became a commonwealth of the U.S. , the remaining TTPI entities chose a dramatically different political status.On May l , l979 , the United States recognized the Constitution of the Marshall Islands and the establishment of the Government of the Marshall Islands ( RMI ) . The United States recognized the Federated States of Micronesia ( FSM ) constitution in 1979 and establishment of the Government of the FSM , both national and state levels . FSM created the 4 State levels from the islands of Yap , Chuuk , Pohnpei and Kosrae.On October 1 , 1994 , the Compact of Free Association between the United States and Palau entered into force , ( U.S. Public Law 99-658 ) . The Compact entered into force for the Marshall Islands on October 2l , l986 , ( Presidential Proclamation No . 5564 ) . The FSM Compact was fully implemented on November 3 , 1986 ( Presidential Proclamation No . 5564 ) .Under the Compact , the status of free association recognizes each Freely Associated State as a sovereign state with the capacity to conduct foreign affairs consistent with the terms of the Compact . The Compact places full responsibility for defense with the United States . The Compact also provides grant funds and Federal program assistance , principally through the Department of the Interior.Under the Compact , the State Department is responsible for government-to-government relations , while Interior is responsible for the oversight and coordination of U.S. programs and funding assistance.District of ColumbiaAmerican SamoaGuamPuerto RicoNorthern Marianas",0

"What features did a medieval castle have ? Stone , mortar , wood-these were the simple components used to construct some of the most heavily fortified structures ever created.Early castles relied on the surrounding landscape to provide much of the protection . Early castles were made of wood and built on hills of `` mottes '' . Surrounded by a high , wooden palisade , motte and bailey castles were used widely until the Norman invasion of 1066 . These fortifications proved too easy to burn , and stone was then used more frequently.Castles were rarely the most comfortable place to live , with only the lord and his family given adequate heat and other amenities . Medieval castles were built for safety , not comfort . Windows were little more than slits in the wall . Cold , stone floors and walls rarely kept in heat , and water had to be brought by the bucketful throughout the castle . Walls were built high to protect from advancing armies , and to provide needed lookout positions.For detailed information , visit : http : //www.medieval-castles.net/castle_architecture/index.htmThe simple stone and mortar architecture made repairs fairly easy to make . It was not uncommon for stones to be used over and over with each successive castle built on the same location . Cannons and gunpowder made the castle ineffective and these large structures evolved in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance to become manor homes and palaces .",0

"What is the metal from which penny coins are made of ? Following is a brief chronology of the metal composition of the cent coin ( penny ) : * The composition was pure copper from 1793 to 1837 . * From 1837 to 1857 , the cent was made of bronze ( 95 percent copper , and five percent tin and zinc ) . * From 1857 , the cent was 88 percent copper and 12 percent nickel , giving the coin a whitish appearance . * The cent was again bronze ( 95 percent copper , and five percent tin and zinc ) from 1864 to 1962 . ( Note : In 1943 , the coin 's composition was changed to zinc-coated steel . This change was only for the year 1943 and was due to the critical use of copper for the war effort . However , a limited number of copper pennies were minted that year . You can read more about the rare , collectible 1943 copper penny in `` What 's So Special about the 1943 Copper Penny . '' ) * In 1962 , the cent 's tin content , which was quite small , was removed . That made the metal composition of the cent 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc . * The alloy remained 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc until 1982 , when the composition was changed to 97.5 percent zinc and 2.5 percent copper ( copper-plated zinc ) . Cents of both compositions appeared in that year .",0

"Is an IRA account protected against civil judgement from a lawsuit when the account owner lives in NYC or NJ ? I am not sure how the state laws of NY or NJ address the protection of IRA assets , but the new bankruptcy law enacted last year does provide ceratin protections on a national basis . the following excerpt is from `` http : //www.retirement-retirement.com/story-486.php '' [ Especially important to participants in employer-based retirement plans is that the bankruptcy act says that all assets rolled over from these plans into an IRA , and all subsequent earnings made inside the account attributable to the rollover , are protected from creditors , regardless of the amount of the rollover . That should remove much of the reluctance among investors to move most retirement plan assets into IRAs if they decide that 's the best financial strategy . While IRAs have unlimited protection for certain rollover amounts , such is not the case for original ( non-rollover ) contributions by the owner to traditional and Roth IRAs . The bankruptcy act put a price tag on the `` reasonably necessary '' amount that might be protected in these IRAs ­ $ 1 million . That is , if the aggregated value of your original contributions and their earnings to traditional and Roth IRAs exceeds $ 1 million , the amount above $ 1 million ( excluding any protected rollover amounts ) could be vulnerable to creditors . That $ 1 million amount is indexed annually to inflation . Most investors building an IRA from scratch wo n't exceed the $ 1 million limit , since annual contribution limits to traditional and Roth IRAs have been relatively low for the past two decades . And the bankruptcy act allows bankruptcy courts to permit the IRA owner to keep more than $ 1 million if it is in the `` interest of justice '' ( though the act did not spell out what constitutes an interest in justice ) . ]",0

"Ladies , how do I ask my wife to dress sexier for me , wear make-up , and stillettos ? My guess is that you 're not talking about a day-to-day thing . What you want is for her to get dressed up and for you two to have crazy monkey sex . Awesome.If you two talk about your sex life , bring it up during one of those conversations . Say `` You know what might be fun to try one time ? `` Do n't try to change the whole of your sex life in a day . A good guideline is that only 1 in 3 sexual encounters with your partner should be `` enhanced '' or `` special '' . If you were to start asking her to dress up like a porn star every time you two made love , she would likely feel less than confident.If you two are open enough , head on over to a strip club . Buy her a lapdance . I went to a club and got one and it was superfun . I left the club thinking it might be fun to dress up like a stripper sometimes . Your wife might get the same ideas.However , if you bring it up and she says something along the lines of `` I 'm not a tawdry whore '' , make it clear that you want her to be beautiful and classy , just like she already is . If she still says no , drop it . The more you pressure her , the more she 'll feel like you do n't like her for who she is.Most women will agree to do something that they 're not entirely into every once in a while for the sake of their partner . Besides , if you respond enthusiastically , she 's more likely to do it again.Good luck !",0

"How is Iron ore mined ? Modern mines , in Minnesota and Michigan in the US , and Eastern Canada mine taconite . Taconite is a term to describe magnetite ore that is very hard and fine-grained . Taconite must be first processed into iron oxide pellets by crushing and magnetic separation of the magnetite to concentrate the iron to about 66 % before it can be used in steel-making.Taconite mining involves moving tremendous amounts of ore and waste . The waste comes in two forms , bedrock in the mine ( mullock ) that is n't ore , and unwanted minerals which are an intrinsic part of the ore rock itself ( gangue ) . The mullock is mined and piled in waste dumps , and the gangue is separated during the beneficiation process and is removed as tailings . Taconite tailings are mostly the mineral quartz , which is chemically inert . This material is stored in large , regulated water settling ponds.In Australia iron ore is won from three main sources ; massive magnetite ore as at Savage River , Tasmania ; pisolite `` channel-iron '' ore derived by mechanical erosion of primary banded-iron formations and accumulated in alluvial channels such at Robe River , Western Australia ; and banded iron formation related ores such as at Newman , Hamersley and Koolyanobbing , Western Australia . Other types of ore are coming to the fore recently , such as oxidised ferruginous hardcaps , for instance iron ore deposits near Argyle , Western Australia.World production averages one billion metric tons of raw ore annually . The world 's largest producer of iron ore is the Brazilian mining corporation CVRD , followed by Australian companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto Group . China is currently the largest consumer of iron ore , which translates to be the world 's largest steel producing country . Iron ore is common worldwide , but commercial mining operations are dominated by the countries listed below : Estimated iron ore production in million tons for 2004 , according to U.S. Geological Survey [ 2 ] China 280 Australia 220 Brazil 220 India 110 Russia 95 United States 54 Ukraine 66 South Africa 40 Canada 31 Sweden 22 Venezuela 18 Kazakhstan 17 Iran 16 Mauritania 10 Mexico 12 Other countries 40 Total world 1250 [ edit ] RefiningPure elemental iron is virtually unknown on the surface of the Earth except as wüstite from meteorites and very rare forms of deep mantle xenoliths . Therefore , all sources of iron used by human industry exploit iron oxide minerals , the primary form which is used in industry being hematite.However , in some situations , more inferior iron ore sources have been used by industrialised societies when access to high-grade hematite ore was not available . This has included utilisation of taconite in the United State , particularly during World War II , and goethite or bog ore used during the Revolutionary war and the Napoleonic wars . Magnetite is often used because it is magnetic and hence easily liberated from the gangue minerals.Inferior sources of iron ore generally required beneficiation . Due to the high density of hematite relative to silicates , beneficiation usually involves a combination of crushing and milling as well as heavy liquid separation . This is achieved by passing the finely crushed ore over a bath of solution containing bentonite or other agent which increases the density of the solution . When the density of the solution is properly calibrated , the hematite will sink and the silicate mineral fragments will float and can be removed.Magnetite is beneficiated by crushing and then separating the magnetite from the gangue minerals with a magnet . This is usually so efficient that lower grade ore can be treated when it is magnetite than a comparable grade of hematite ore , especially when the magnetite is quite coarse.To convert an oxide of iron to metallic iron it must be smelted .",0

A recurring example is the apparently simple `` How do I set up my mail server in Outlook Express ?

The wizard asks for your name ( easy ) , your e-mail address ( also usually easy ) , and then asks you to set up your mail server .

"Why are honey bees appearing outside at night , in the dark and cold ? Today is ( was ) December 23 . For the past week or so , I 've been finding honey bees outside my front door after sunset . I 'm in the Phoenix metro area , so it 's not freezing cold , but cool enough to kill these poor guys . I never see them during the day and I have nothing on or around my door to attract them . I thought bees did n't fly at night , but apparently they do . Anyway , I was out on my front patio until an hour after sunset tonight - no bees . I went out about 3 hours later and there were five bees . I just went out again and there are eight . ( Seven are dead . ) I 've looked at these carefully - they are normal honey bees , not ground-dwellers . Any ideas why ? I 'm mostly just curious , but I 'd also like to eliminate them so I can go out barefoot again ! It is possible these were drones . For bees September through December can be the beginning of a new cycle.I quote : '' The time of day that drones fly in search of a mate depends on many factors , such as the geographic location , day length , and temperature . Drones usually fly from the hive in large numbers between 11 a.m. and 4:30 p.m . Morning or early afternoon flights may last 2 or 3 hours . Later flights are shorter . When out of the hive , drones congregate in `` mating areas , '' which may serve to attract virgin queens . These areas usually are less than 100 feet from the ground and seem to be associated with land terrain . ''",0

When someone sneezed , they were immediately blessed ( `` God bless you ! '' ) in the hope that they would not subsequently develop the plague . All that prayer apparently worked , judging by how quickly the plague of 590 AD diminished . It is also interesting to note that it is impossible to close your eyes when you sneeze , so everytime I sneeze , I try to say a little prayer .",0

"What is your opinion on the illegal immigrant situation in the US ? The only way that America is growing is through immigration . If it were n't for immigration , we 'd have a zero or negative population growth . Our country is graying rapidly -- many older people and fewer young .

I believe that immigration is good , necessary and as a country we should be thankful that people choose to come here . People bring labor , brains and so much more . As far as `` legal '' goes , it is always preferred that people do things legally , however , rules & laws change according to society 's needs . Perhaps the best answer here is to welcome the immigrant and change the rules as to what is legal/illegal .",0

Its like a home , every home needs a specific address so that the postal system can forward postal mail . Earlier routers ( as the one that you have ) may not allow multiple IP allocation so you may not be able to use the router with multiple computers .

"Anyone give me a definitive answer about the origins of the term `` o.k. '' ? thanks ? The letters , not to keep you guessing , stand for `` oll korrect . '' They 're the result of a fad for comical abbreviations that flourished in the late 1830s and 1840s . Read buttressed his arguments with hundreds of citations from newspapers and other documents of the period . As far as I know his work has never been successfully challenged.The abbreviation fad began in Boston in the summer of 1838 and spread to New York and New Orleans in 1839 . The Boston newspapers began referring satirically to the local swells as OFM , `` our first men , '' and used expressions like NG , `` no go , '' GT , `` gone to Texas , '' and SP , `` small potatoes . '' Many of the abbreviated expressions were exaggerated misspellings , a stock in trade of the humorists of the day . One predecessor of OK was OW , `` oll wright , '' and there was also KY , `` know yuse , '' KG , `` know go , '' and NS , `` nuff said . `` Most of these acronyms enjoyed only a brief popularity . But OK was an exception , no doubt because it came in so handy . It first found its way into print in Boston in March of 1839 and soon became widespread among the hipper element . It did n't really enter the language at large , however , until 1840 . That 's when Democratic supporters of Martin Van Buren adopted it as the name of their political club , giving OK a double meaning . ( `` Old Kinderhook '' was a native of Kinderhook , New York . ) OK became the warcry of Tammany hooligans in New York while beating up their opponents . It was mentioned in newspaper stories around the country.Van Buren 's opponents tried to turn the phrase against him , saying that it had originated with Van Buren 's allegedly illiterate predecessor , Andrew Jackson , a story that has survived to this day . They also devoted considerable energy to coming up with unflattering interpretations , e.g. , `` Out of Kash , Out of Kredit , and Out of Klothes . '' Newspaper editors and publicists around the country delighted in coming up with even sillier interpretations -- Oll Killed , Orfully Konfused , Often Kontradicts , etc. -- so that by the time the campaign was over the expression had taken firm root nationwide .",0

"what are the effects of the emergence of overseas filipino workers to the economy of the philippines ? One can certainly write a book about this topic , but here are a few consequences stemming from the increasing numbers of overseas Filipino workers , of OFWs.Sociological : many observers have noticed changes in the traditional family structure ; as a substantial portion of OFWs are women , they often work abroad to send money home to put their children through school ; thus , children often live in single parent households where the primary breadwinner is absent and gender roles are reversed , i.e . the mother is the breadwinner , while the father takes on the role of homemaker.Economic : overseas remittances are important in keeping the Philippines ' balance of payments in surplus ; as such , this preserves the level of reserve assets held by the Philippines , thus contributing to debt sustainability ( the country is one of the largest issuers of sovereign debt in the developing world ) and propping up the exchange rate ( thanks in part to the large inflow of overseas remittances from OFWs , the Philippine peso was one of the strongest performers vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar in 2005 ) .Political : given their increased importance in the economy , OFWs have rightly gained increased influence as a political constituency -- up until 2004 , overseas Filipinos were denied the right to vote ; because of their large numbers -- some estimates go as high as 8 million -- their vote could potentially swing an election ; however , as evidenced by the low turnout by eligible overseas Filipino voters in 2004 , huge logistics problems need to be tackled to fulfill that potential .",0

"What is the law on assault on minors in Virginia ? I have a 17 yr old boy and his 14 yr old girlfreind harrsing us . It 's the same as everywhere ; you or your b/f hurt her , you go to jail unless it 's self defense and you 'd better be able to prove it . I 'm a former police officer and if you attacked her , I would arrest you . What you need to do is to talk to the girl 's parents . She sounds obsessive and that can be dangerous . You need to document every offense , possibly video tape her doing it or recording her with a hidden tape recorder , which , in Texas , you can legally do as long as one party in the conversation is aware that it 's being taped , i.e . you or your boyfriend talking to her . If she shows up at your home , call the police . If her parents refuse to put a stop to it , go to the school principal if you are all in the same school and if need be , the police but do not lay a hand on her unless she attacks you . Where do you think sympathy might lie in a court of law ? With you and your b/f who are older , or what they would consider a child misbehaving ? Right or wrong , sympathy will be on her side because of her age . You both have to be the mature ones in this case . Do n't try to solve it on your own . Do tell her when you speak to her that you are going to call the police or go to her parents and if that does n't work , do as I instructed . It 's the safesty way for anyone . There is no excuse for violence unless you are protecting yourself or someone else from a physical threat . Good luck .",0

When is the new spouse held responsible for any debts ? Any info you have would be appreciated . Thanks . There are some general legal principles:1 . Spouses are generally presumed to co-own anything gained during the marriage and be responsible for any debts incurred during the marriage.2 . But there are a whole lot of exceptions.3 . And there is no way to know how these rules would be applied in each case . It 's all exceptionally fact-specific.4 . The only way to get a handle on the issues is to consult with a lawyer.5 . But you should never presume that you `` do n't have the money '' to get divorced or that it would be financially ruinous . For the non-monied spouse , the news is usually a lot better than she might expect.6 . See a lawyer .",0

"President Kennedy a gread pres. ? Why specifically is President Kennedy remembered as such a great President ? What was his greatest achievement ? He was charismatic , but he was n't a great president.His unplanned remarks to Nikita Khruschev , President of the Soviet Union , caused Khruschev to judge Kennedy to be weak . Consequently , he installed nuclear missles in Cuba . Kennedy reacted by blockading Cuba . For several days in October 1963 , the world was on the brink of a nuclear war.Shortly after taking office , he allowed plans for an invasion of Cuba to proceed . The invasion by Cuban refugees from Miami was a debacle that was a violation of international law and a humiliation to the United States.He continued the program of sending military advisors to Viet Nam . After his death , this was continued by President Lyndon Johnson and expanded into the Viet Nam war . The Viet Nam war destroyed Johnson 's presidency.To his great credit , he was aggressive about furthering the Civil Rights movement by supporting activists with Federal authority in several high profile integration efforts.If he had lived , almost surely he would have been elected to a second term . He seemed to grow wiser while in office . Would that wisdom have led him to become a great president ? Would the US have become bogged down in an unwinnable war in Viet Nam ? Would his philandering have brought him down ? Interesting questions.Wikipedia knows all.I was 10 when he was elected and 13 when he was assassinated . I will never forget the optimism he brought to the country . We believed he could lead us into the bright future . I will never forget the terror of the Cuban Missle Crisis . I will never forget the devastation I felt when he was assassinated . The United States has not been the same since . John Kennedy was the last president who _lead_ us . Presidents after him have been followers without vision.In 1989 ( I was 39 ) , I went to President Kennedy 's grave in Arlington Cemetary . Probably 15 or 20 people were there . I was amazed that people were moved to silence , even those obviously born after his presidency . I felt a great deal of reverence and had tears in my eyes .",0

"What happenes if you default on a 401K loan ? If you fail to pay your 401k loan , then you are taxed on it as if you would have taken a regular distribution . ( Tax + Penalty for early distribution ) .The amount that you owe is deducted from your total 401k amount.For example . If you take a 401k loan for $ 1000 , and you have $ 3000 in your 401k and you quit your job , then the $ 1000 is deducted from your $ 3000 leaving you with a $ 2000 401k total.The $ 1000 is also treated like a `` distribution '' . In other words , it 's treated like an early withdrawal . So at the end of the year , you owe a 43 % penalty on the $ 1000 , or $ 430 in taxes . ( 33 % income tax [ or whatever your income tax rate is ] , 10 % penalty ) .Further more , since that $ 1000 is treated like regular income , it may push you into a higher tax bracket .",0
"what is biodiesel ? Biodiesel is a fuel that is made from either waste oil ( collected from restaurants ) or pure vegetable oil . It is often mixed with `` regular '' diesel . You can buy it at some gas stations , although it is n't common . The ratio of biodiesel to regular diesel varies depending on the vehicle and the season ( less biodiesel in the winter , for example ) . The benefits of biodiesel include lessening our dependence on foreign oil , increasing our use of renewable resources , especially those that are produced in our own country , and cleaner fuel both in use and in production . The US government 's standards for regular diesel are not as stringent as they are in other countries , although that will change in the next year or so . Right now , there are few American automakers who produce diesel passenger vehicles . You 'll find diesel trucks , but I do n't think there are any American made cars . This may change as the quality of diesel improves and as biodiesel becomes more readily available.Biodiesel is fairly easy to make . There are a lot of `` home brewers '' out there who collect waste oil from restaurants , filter it as necessary , and process it into biodiesel . My boss makes it in our shop and we use it in our company vehicles . Except for the occasional nasty smelling batch of cooking oil , it 's great . We 're greatly reducing our company 's fuel costs because the diesel vehicles have much better gas mileage , and we 're producing the biodiesel for less than $ 1.25 per gallon .",0

"when is the right moment to say `` i want you to kiss me '' ? when would be the good time to say it ... just blurt out and say it ... or like i donno ... i 'm just REALLY confused ! ! !

If you wait for it , it may never happen , but at least you wo n't have the embarrassment of having ASKED for a kiss , only to be shrugged off .",0

"What is a blog ? I have head this word a lot of times but did not understand it . what does it mean ? A blog is a website for which an individual or a group frequently generates text , photographs , video or audio files , and/or links , typically ( but not always ) on a daily basis . The term is a shortened form of weblog . Authoring a blog , maintaining a blog or adding an article to an existing blog is called `` blogging '' . Individual articles on a blog are called `` blog posts , '' `` posts , '' or `` entries '' . The person who posts these entries is called a `` blogger '' . * Electronic communities existed before internetworking . For example the AP wire was , in effect , similar to a large chat room with `` wire fights '' and electronic conversations . Another pre-digital electronic community , amateur ( or `` ham '' ) radio , allowed individuals who set up their own broadcast equipment to communicate with others directly . Ham radio also had logs called `` glogs '' that were personal diaries made using wearable computers in the early 1980s . * Before blogging became popular , digital communities took many forms , including Usenet , e-mail lists and bulletin boards . In the 1990s Internet forum software , such as WebX , created running conversations with `` threads . '' Threads are topical connections between messages on a electronic `` corkboard . '' See `` Common terms , '' below . * Diarists kept journals on the Web : most called themselves online diarists , journalists , journallers , or journalers . A few called themselves escribitionists . The Open Pages webring contained members of the online-journal community . The first famous journaller was probably Justin Hall . * Other forms of journals kept online also existed . A notable example was game programmer John Carmack 's widely read journal , published via the finger protocol . * Websites , including both corporate sites and personal homepages , had and still often have `` What 's New '' or `` News '' sections , often on the index page and sorted by date .",0

"what is cancer ? Simple answer : A cell in the body that has gone out of control causing a disease.Cancer is a class of diseases characterized by uncontrolled division of cells and the ability of these cells to invade other tissues , either by direct growth into adjacent tissue ( invasion ) or by implantation into distant sites ( metastasis ) . This unregulated growth is caused by damage to DNA , resulting in mutations to genes that control cell division . Several mutations may be required to transform a normal cell into a malignant cell . These mutations are often caused by chemicals or physical agents called carcinogens . Some mutations occur spontaneously , or they can be inherited ( germ line mutations . ) Cancer can cause many different symptoms , depending on the site and character of the malignancy and whether there is metastasis . Cancer may be painless . A definitive diagnosis usually requires the histologic examination of tissue by a pathologist . This tissue is obtained by biopsy or surgery . Once diagnosed , cancer is usually treated with surgery , chemotherapy , or radiation.If untreated , cancers may eventually cause death . Cancer is mainly a disease of later years , and is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries . Most cancers can be treated and many cured , especially if treatment begins early . Many forms of cancer are associated with exposure to environmental factors , such as tobacco smoking , alcohol , and certain viruses . Some of these can be avoidable , and public health and vaccination programmes are important on a global scale.Another viewpoint : A general term for about 100 diseases characterized by uncontrolled , abnormal growth of cells . The resulting mass , or tumor , can invade and destroy surrounding normal tissues . Cancer cells from the tumor can spread through the blood or lymph ( the clear fluid that bathes body cells ) to start new cancers in other parts of the body ( metastases ) .",0

"I have bought a new laptop ... it is wifi compliant ! what sort of card should i buy to have wireless experience ? Can anyone let me know the name of company and cost of card in euros ! ! Are you saying that the laptop does not already have a wireless card in it . Most new laptops sold are already equipped with 802.11g ( aka 54g ) wireless cards . I would check your manual or specs to make sure that it does n't already have a card in it . If it does n't read on.If you want to use WiFi in your home then you will need a router . My personal favorite is anything by Netgear but any basic WiFi router should serve your needs.As I said above if your laptop does n't already have a WiFi card , then you will need to get a PCMCIA or USB wireless adapter.I would bet though , that the new laptop does already have a WiFi adapter in it .",0
"over 200 years ago what did Carolus Linnaeus classify living things on ? Taxonomy . In his major work Systema Naturae ( The System of Nature ) , first published in 1735 , Linnaeus devised a system of classification of organisms that is still in use today . This system places living things within increasingly specific categories based on common attributes—from a general grouping ( kingdom ) down to the specific individual ( species ) . Using this system , Linnaeus named nearly 10,000 plant and animal species in his lifetime . Not an evolutionist by any means , Linnaeus believed that each species was created by God and was incapable of change . Nevertheless , his orderly groupings of living things provided important insights for later theorists .",0

"When buying DVD Movies , what is the difference between full frame and wide screen movies ? The difference is due to something called `` aspect ratio '' . Widescreen movies have a 16:9 aspect ratio , meaning that they are more rectangular than square in the shape of the screen ( the screen is wider than regular , hence the term `` widescreen '' ) . The difference in the picture is that with widescreen , you see more on the edges of the picture . For instance , if there were 100 trees in a shot , with full frame you might only see 70 of them because the edges are cut off a bit . To me , this makes a difference in the movie , but not so much that you would have a different understanding of the film . Moving forward , I would say that you should buy your movies in 16:9 or widescreen format because more and more TV 's are now in that format .",0

He knows that , and worked miracles such as that to offer evidence of His true Nature.Heck , He tried to TALK and REASON with them and they still ran Him out of town on a rail ( or cross ! ) Some people still do n't believe in miracles because `` they ca n't be proven .

"explain at least six disadvantages of channls of communication. ? 1. your answer may be outside known channels.2 . If the only way to get a message to someone is through a long set of links the message has a good chance of getting garbled.3 . If there is a set of constraints and rules governing what is allowed to go through the channels important information will never be allowed in.4.a : If the channels flow through a pyramidal structure with new untrained empolyees at the bottom and the CEO/president at the top messages from a large workforce could be screened out and never seen . b : those at the top would not have time to look at all messages even if they were unscreened.5 . Language is a channel of communication . If you do n't have an interpreter available the amount of information able to flow will be very small.6 . Any channel of communication that relys on infrastucture ie : the internet , the telephone has at least 2 disavatages : the infrasturcture can be broken ( the power goes out , the computer is dropped out the window , trees fall on a telephone line ... ect . ) also the security of the message is in doubt ( black hackers , wiretaps , paranoid goverments ... ect . ) Hope some of those helped .",0

Maybe she felt that she wanted someone more inline with her own personal goals and aspirations .",0
"Why do some people grind their teeth when they sleep ? Teeth grinding , or bruxism , is often related to stress . It also can be caused by crooked or missing teeth or by something that creates an abnormal bite , such as a high spot on a molar . To diagnose bruxism , dentists look for flattened spots on the teeth . Treatment includes smoothing down those high spots and behavior modification for stress reduction . Your dentist also may recommend a mouth guard or a custom-made splint to be worn at night . These prevent teeth from coming together , which interrupts the grinding and gives muscles a chance to relax.Here 's some more information : Bruxism can have a variety of psychological and physical causes . These include stress , the body 's reaction to poor tooth alignment , as a complication of severe brain injury , or as an uncommon side effect of some antidepressant medications .",0

"What are the differences between Communism and Socialism ? I want to know the basic differences . And please , do n't make this up . The quick 'n ' easy way to remember the difference between Socialism and Communism is : Socialism is `` from each according to their ability , to each according to their DEEDS , '' whereas Communism is `` from each according to their ability to each according to their NEEDS . '' Socialism is the stage between Capitalism and Communism . It builds upon the previous system ( Capitalism ) by nationalizing the `` means of production '' ( i.e . corporations , resources , banks , etc . ) , but not by making everyone equal . In other words , people will be paid wages based on several factors ( social need , difficulty , amount of schooling required , etc . ) , so not everyone will make the same wage -- as is often a misinterpretation of Socialism . Communism is the point where the state `` withers away . '' In other words , it 's quite a few years in the future . If I had to guess , I 'd say at least 10 generations of established Socialism has to occur before people evolve enough to realize that hurting others or the system ends up hurting themselves . As Communists we advocate Socialism because it is the next necessary step to get to Communism . In other words , it 's not that we 've given up on building a house , we just realize there is a need for a sturdy foundation first . Communists believe in human evolution . We evolve in accordance to the system we live within . Capitalism has allowed us to evolve out of our feudalistic ways ( for the most part ) , and slavery does not exist in our country anymore ( for the most part ) . But Capitalism , which is driven by the need to always increase profits , founders a `` dog eat dog '' mentality . This is not a sustainable system , either for humankind or for the environment . Under Socialism people will evolve to the point where they care about each other regardless of their location or race or whatever . If we are to survive as a species , we need to evolve . That 's one of the many reasons I 'm a Communist . Finally , one misconception people often have about Communism is that we are looking to make everyone poor . On the contrary , we want everyone to enjoy as much as possible the fruits of our vast wealth .",0

"Help Me Please ! Algebra no understand ! ? How do you find the slope of an linear equation your help would be great !

Measure the distance from the bottom floor to the floor at the top of the stairs , that height is your 'rise ' . Now , measure the distance between the first stair on the flight and the last stair that was climbed horizontally , and that is your 'run'.Once you have those two measurements , you can calculate the slope by dividing the height of the floor above by the length taken up by the stairs to get there . Draw the stairs as a right triangle.The right side is the rise , the bottom is the run , and the 'hypotenuse ' is the square root of the sum of both . The 'slope ' , is the right side divided by the bottom .",0

"what is day saving time ? Daylight Saving Time ( or Summer Time as it is called in many countries ) is a way of getting more out of the summer days by advancing the clocks by one hour during the summer . Then , the sun will appear to rise one hour later in the morning when people are usually asleep anyway , at the benefit of one hour longer evenings when awake : The sunset and sunrise are one hour later than during normal time . DST could save energy ( less artificial light is needed during the evening ) and make the country more efficient in addition to the pleasing effect of lighter evenings . To make DST work , the clocks have to be adjusted one hour ahead when DST begins ( during spring ) , and adjusted back one hour to standard time every autumn . There are many countries observing DST , and many who do not . Benjamin Franklin suggested the method in 1784 , but it was first during World War I , in 1916 in several counties in Europe that DST was adopted , although it was proposed several times before , but rejected .",0

"i want to know everything about GENETICS. ? Genetics , scientific study of how physical , biochemical , and behavioural traits are transmitted from parents to their offspring . The word itself was coined in 1906 by the British biologist William Bateson . Geneticists determine the mechanisms of inheritance whereby the offspring of sexually reproducing organisms do not exactly resemble their parents , and the differences and similarities between parents and offspring recur from generation to generation in repeated patterns . The investigation of these patterns has led to some of the most exciting discoveries in modern biology.Soon after Mendel 's work was rediscovered , scientists realized that the patterns of inheritance he had described paralleled the action of chromosomes in dividing cells , and they proposed that the Mendelian units of inheritance , the genes , are carried by the chromosomes . This led to intensive studies of cell division.Every cell comes from the division of a pre-existing cell . All the cells that make up a human being , for example , are derived from the successive divisions of a single cell , the zygote ( see Fertilization ) , which is formed by the union of an egg and a sperm . The great majority of the cells produced by the division of the zygote are , in the composition of their hereditary material , identical to one another and to the zygote itself ( assuming that no mutations occur ; see below ) . Each cell of a higher organism is composed of a jellylike layer of material , the cytoplasm , which contains many small structures . This cytoplasmic material surrounds a prominent body called the nucleus . Every nucleus contains a number of minute , threadlike chromosomes . Some relatively simple organisms , such as cyanobacteria and bacteria , have no distinct nucleus but do have cytoplasm , which contains one or more chromosomes.Chromosomes vary in size and shape and usually occur in pairs . The members of each pair , called homologues , closely resemble each other . Most cells in the human body contain 23 pairs of chromosomes , whereas most cells of the fruit fly Drosophila contain four pairs , and the bacterium Escherichia coli has a single chromosome in the form of a ring . Every chromosome in a cell is now known to contain many genes , and each gene is located at a particular site , or locus , on the chromosome.The process of cell division by which a new cell comes to have an identical number of chromosomes as the parent cell is called mitosis ( see Reproduction ) . In mitotic division each chromosome divides into two equal parts , and the two parts travel to opposite ends of the cell . After the cell divides , each of the two resulting cells has the same number of chromosomes and genes as the original cell ( see Cell : Division , Reproduction , and Differentiation ) . Every cell formed in this process thus has the same genetic material . Simple one-celled organisms and some multicellular forms reproduce by mitosis ; it is also the process by which complex organisms achieve growth and replace worn-out tissue.Higher organisms that reproduce sexually are formed from the union of two special sex cells known as gametes . Gametes are produced by meiosis , the process by which germ cells divide . It differs from mitosis in one important way : in meiosis a single chromosome from each pair of chromosomes is transmitted from the original cell to each of the new cells . Thus , each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes that are found in the other body cells . When two gametes unite in fertilization , the resulting cell , called the zygote , contains the full , double set of chromosomes . Half of these chromosomes normally come from one parent and half from the other.For more than 50 years after the science of genetics was established and the patterns of inheritance through genes were clarified , the largest questions remained unanswered : how are the chromosomes and their genes copied from cell to cell , and how do they direct the structure and behaviour of living things ? Two American genet",0

"When is it morally acceptable to break the law ? I do n't want to hear never , because I believe there are some situations , such as in Nazi Germany , or early 19th century america ( slavery ) , when people have a moral right to defy the law . Related to this , when is it morally ok to revolt ( or use violence against established authority ) ? What are some of the criteria ? I 'm not asking this because i 'm planning to revolt or think that it would be a good idea , just curious about what people think . lol . I think it is usually acceptable to break the law if , by not breaking it , someone would suffer bodily harm or death . Also , if the law is fundamentally designed to discriminate , I think that at the very least some people need to break it in order to be able to argue against it in the Supreme Court , for example when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat .",0
"Legal action against online forum members ? A few years ago , I belonged to a lively forum . I was only one of about five people who did not care for a certain action among most of the forum members , which numbered in the hundreds . Soon , we opposers were attacked one by one , and driven out of the forum . I contacted the forum editor and discussed the posting rules with him . It turns out he was unwilling to do anything about this , so I resigned from the forum of my own free will . Since that time , I 've been maligned repeatedly , mainly by one person , and have discovered his posts giving out my personal details , including my description , telling people to beat me up if they saw me in public ! I never corresponded with this person outside the forum , nor within it . I 've lost touch with the few posters I called friends . Do I have any legal recourse ? The editor of the forum simply tells this person to knock it off for a short while , and he starts over again . Two years is more than enough time for this to be ended ! Mature , this guy is n't ! If this person used your real name and/or address , and said malicious untrue things about you , I think you have a pretty good case for defamation ( libel ) .

"is being gay okay y ? No . We each have an obligation to ourselves and to society to do the right thing .

Epicurus , one of the other first atomists was strongly anti-determinist , and introduced a random element , called the swerve , to attempt to solve the problem of determinism .

"Why did the German government introduce Submarine warfare ? NO SPAM PLZ ! I presume you mean `` unrestricted '' submarine warfare.The short answer was to win the war . A better answer was because the English blockade of of Germany had the effect of starving the German populace of both food and resources.During WW1 , the British Navy was the most powerful force in the world . The German surface Navy could not hope to be an effective counter to it , so Germany had to resort to tactics other than traditional surface conflict . Submarines or Unterseebooten ( U-Boats ) were one means employed by the Germans . U-Boats were the `` Stealth Bombers '' of thier day . They could sneak up on surface ships undetected , and sink them with torpedoes.Germany 's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was originally instituted to combat the overwhelming superiority of the English Navy , but when they started sinking un-armed vessels with other nations peoples on board ( specifically Americans ) this helped draw America into the war . When the American 's arrived , it tipped the balance in favor of the allies ultimately losing the war for Germany .",0

"in connectiom to my last question , Who gave us the knowlegde to be able to attain this said evolution ? Erin pls answer this one ... . all can answer ... . Thats the problem , we dont have to ask who created the creator because we are told that God just `` is , was , and always will be '' . The arrogance of man to think that we are smart enough to understand everything is our greatest downfall . Ever hear people say that when they think they know everything , they learn that they know very little ? Virtually everything that we know today was once unreasonable to the abilities of our brain . Just like no one knew about gravity until it was discovered and able to be measured . People thought the Earth was flat , and when they were told it was round , it took many years before they realized the person was right . Then they discovered later it was somewhat oval . Just because the most intelligent scientist in the world can not understand supernatural things , dont mean they dont exist . Maybe someday someone will discover a way to `` see '' these things too , so that everyone will have the knowledge . Just because it hasnt happened yet dont mean we are at the end of all learning , and it wont.The fact that we are the only animals on the planet that aspire for greatness , desire things that we dont need , and have learned how to create things ourself is proof that God created us in His image . We dont question why we have the ability to learn and evolve , we just take it for granted.Mankind has in effect became gods , because they forgot and no longer appreciate what created them . They believe as long as they can invent and create new things that now they are gods . This has been prophesied in Revelation . Part of being marked with the mark of the beast is man becoming their own god .",0

Otherwise it would fall within the normal range.Your personal score report should also have given you a percentile rank , which tells you how you did in comparison with others who took the test .

"Has anyone lived in India ? What was your experience ? I want to visit but India is so vast and has so many appealing areas , that I would n't know where to begin ? Any advice ? it depends on what you want to do and see . I would n't say that I lived there , but I was there for 5 months . The longest period of time i was in one place was 2 months . Honestly i do n't even know where to begin describing what it was like . it was without a doubt a very positive , but sometimes stressful , experience . I think that everybody should travel to india at least once . I traveled only in the north , so that is the only area i can really give advice on . For the south i heard that Kerala , Hampi , and Pondicherry were the places to see , but I could n't tell you if that is true . To start with let me say that traveling in india is not as daunting as it seems . i started out with a program , but stayed on after its end when i realized that i would be able to get around on my own . unless you have about a year , you will probably not see everything , so do n't worry about seeing everything . You can probably get by just fine with only english , but it never hurts to know a little hindi or whatever the local language is , if only to see the shock on people 's faces . lol .

Sanitation is a big problem over there ( to us ! ) , but if you just use common sense you will be fine . it is a very safe country for the most part , but if you are a lone female you do need to exercise some caution . nearly every female traveller i came across had at least one complaint of minor harassment.the places that i saw that i really liked and/or you have to see are in the north : ladakh , dharamsala , manali , kashmir are all in the mountains and are much more relaxed than the cities in the central plains , although kashmir is not so safe in rajasthan : jodhpur without a doubt , jaipur is more popular with tourists but i did n't like it as muchin central india : agra of course , orchha ( near jhansi ) , varanasi ( stressful , but worth it for the sights and culture shock ) , khajuraho ( although they really go after tourists here ) , and delhi of course ( but it can be a bit stressful if you stay there too long ) in the east : darjeeling is a good place to chill , and i heard sikkim is amazingthe best advice i have , if you have n't already done it , is to get a guidebook ( i used lonely planet ) now and start looking at pics and reading about the places . i really hope that you get as much out of it as i did.if you do have any other specific questions , you can email me if you want : jeff32224 @ yahoo.comgood luck !",0
