"what does center do really ? i 'm new to this sport but i like it very much.can anybody teach me a little Typically , the center is the tallest man on the floor . Traditional centers stay close to the basket on offense , where they can use their size to get good shots because they are so close . Often these are dunks , layups , put backs ( shots off of a rebound ) , or hook shots . They 're also expected to be the best rebounders , since they are taller than everyone else.On defense , centers again stay close to the basket because if a guard or forward gets around the person defending them , the center can still slide over and block or alter the shot ( since presumably , he is taller than the player trying to shoot ) . They are again expected to rebound.Non-traditional centers , particularly those from foreign countries ( no idea why ) , move farther from the basket to shoot . Some , like China 's Wang Zhu-Zhu , are actually good three point shooters . Having a center like this is sometimes considered an advantage , since traditional centers are not used to guarding a player far from the basket .",1

"Can i install a intercooler on my car w/o the turbo ? intake hose on 1 tube & the air filter side of intercoole You can install anything you want . The real question should be : Will intercooling help performance of a non-turbo car . The reason for the intercooler is to decrease the temperature of the forced air generated by the turbo . Consider the fact that it is compressed air generated by hot exhaust gases which turn the vane in the turbo . By cooling the air generated by the turbo , you can increase the power capability . You can research air/air intercoolers and even water/ice/air intercoolers on yahoo search.To answer your question , yes you could install one but you would likely see no performance gain and maybe even a drop . This is due to the additional volume added to the intake tract by the piping and intercooler itself . Your best bet is a cold air intake which you can buy from most any aftermarket parts place .",1

Plus , it 's not nearly as boring as being tethered by your back wheel ! My general feeling is that I felt like a trainer would make me lazier overall , even if I were gaining strength.The only downside for me is that rollers will wear out your back tire by the end of winter . Hardly an issue though , because the road would do the same .",1

"what do these college sports phrases mean ? 1 ) true freshman 2 ) fifth year senior 3 ) walk on 4 ) red shirt . Thanks The NCAA rules allow a player 5 years to complete his/her 4 years of eligibility.A true freshman is someone playing during the first year of eligibility.A fifth year senior is someone who sat out a year ( see red shirt ) and is completing the 4th year of eligibility during his/her 5th year in school.A walkon is someone who was not recruted and given a scholarship . The athlete just showed up , tried out , and was good enough to stay on the team.A red shirt is an athlete who is passing up a year of play to extend eligibility . Red shirted players are allowed to practice with the team but not take part in competition.Originally , red shirting was allowed if an athlete was injured severly enough to end his season . The team could petition the NCAA for an extra year of eligibilty , and the player was red shirted for the remainder of the year.The name comes from the practice of having injured football players wear a red practice jersey to protect him during practice . Today redshirting may be done to allow a player to gain an extra year of experience before playing in `` The Big Time '' . It also may be done as a personel management tool . If a coach has two equally good players competing for one position as quarterback , one may be redshirted . That way his eligability is n't used up sitting on the bench .",1

"a canadien hockey player in 1985 ? a canadien hockey player in 1985 On February 22 , 2002 , Wayne Gretzky made history as the architect of Canada 's first gold medal in Olympic men 's hockey in 50 years . It proved that three years after retirement , `` The Great One 's '' contribution to the game and country he loves is not over.Gretzky was only ten years old when his talent as the defenceman-winger-centre for the Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers caught the attention of Toronto Telegram sportswriter John Iaboni . His story about the prolific 369-goal scorer turned out to be a glimpse of what was in store for the greatest hockey player to lace up a pair of skates . Gretzky was born on January 26 , 1961 . By age two his father and `` greatest coach , '' Walter already had his son on skates . By the time he joined the Nadrofsky Steelers , he already had a reputation of carving out scoring opportunities against players twice his age and taller than his modest height.At 15 , he joined the Ontario Hockey Association , turning professional two years later as an underage junior with the Indianapolis Racers in the now defunct World Hockey Association ( WHA ) . He only played eight games for the Racers ( chalking up three goals and three assists ) before being traded to the WHA 's Edmonton Oilers where he was named WHA Rookie of the Year.In 1979 , the Edmonton Oilers entered the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . Gretzky remained in Edmonton nine seasons , leading the Oilers to four Stanley Cups , and helping to build hockey 's strongest franchise of the 1980s.Not surprisingly , Gretzky 's trade to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988 made front-page news and topped all national newscasts . Gretzky was the ambassador of hockey ; the struggling Kings needed to fill seats , and the NHL wanted to promote its game in the United States.Since joining the NHL , Gretzky has had more impact on the record book than any other player . By the time he retired , The Great One held over 60 NHL records and most of the sport 's prestigious hardware , including nine Hart Trophies for most valuable player and five Lester B. Pearson Trophies for MVP as voted by other players.His most cherished record , however , came on October 25 , 1989 , when he scored two goals and an assist to surpass the all-time points record set by his hero , Gordie Howe.Wayne Gretzky retired from professional hockey as a New York Ranger on April 18 , 1999 . In addition to the NHL , and his considerable charity work , he has made Canadians proud on the world stage - particularly as Executive Director of Team Canada for the 2002 Winter Olympics . Additionally , Gretzky is part owner of the Phoenix Coyotes.Canada 's Walk of Fame Trivia : Wayne Gretzky 's first jersey was No . 9 after his hockey hero , Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings .",1

"What is best prop for Yamaha 250 outboard ? The selection of the best propeller is a combination of many different factors , such as type of boat , L.O.A of boat , type of hull , use and performance ( i.e . : better top end speed or increased load carrying performance ? ) First of all , for an engine like this I would recommend a stainless steel propeller . SS propellers are stronger than most all other propeller materials with main advantages : longer life and high hydrodynamic efficiency derived from stiffer blades . To select the optimum propeller for the use of your boat and motor combination , you should make some test runs , keeping the following guidelines in mind : -Have a selection of propellers to test with . -Use an accurate tachometer to measure RPM . -Use an accurate speedometer or some means ( i.e . : G.P.S . ) to measure boat speed . -Safely test each setup at W.O.T . -Make sure every test is with `` identical '' settings . ( i.e . : Boat load , trim angle , engine height , water conditions , etc . ) Since Yamaha 250 is a power trim equipped engine , it should be tested at optimum trim angle which is the highest trim position that can be run without excessive venting ( slippage ) either in a straight line or in turns . Selecting the right propeller while testing , you must have in mind that : -Engine RPM at W.O.T . must be within the recommended operating range with the rated horsepower RPM as the target number ( see specification in Operator 's Manual ) . -Increasing or decreasing propeller pitch directly affects engine load throughout its RPM range . -A high pitch and/or diameter propeller on an engine , will result in lower engine RPM throughout its entire RPM range for a given throttle setting . -A low pitch and/or diameter propeller on the engine , will result in higher engine RPM throughout its entire RPM range for a given throttle setting . -A boat 's hull design -- and condition -- may limit its overall performance . -Transom height , transom angle and engine trim angle , all affect propeller performance . -Atmospheric pressure , temperature , and humidity also affect engine performance , which directly affects propeller performance . -Salt water is more buoyant than fresh water ; this may cause some hulls to run faster than identical freshwater setups . -Water and wind conditions can play a big part in boat performance and propeller efficiency . -The boat 's load and position of the load can significantly affect performance.Generally , the rule of the thumb is that the correct size propeller will provide the best overall fuel economy and performance.If I could have some more data , I think I would be able to give a couple of suggestions concerning number of blades , pitch and diameter for your engine/boat combination .",1

"Is there a dallas bias ? Do the Dallas Cowboys have a bias against them with the media in the rest of the country ? I do n't think that a bias necessarily exists within the media , but among fans I believe there sure are a lot of Cowboys haters . There are several reasons for this . For one , there is a little bit of jealousy for `` America 's Team '' . These feelings are still carrying over from their dynasty in the 90 's ( and even the 70s ) . Also , the organization has had many abrasive characters : owner Jerry Jones , the Tuna , ex-stars such as Michael Irvin , and the myriad of criminals and druggies they 've paraded through in the last 10/15 years . As with any great sports organization , fans are very polarized ... you either love 'em or hate 'em . I love 'em , but conversely I despise great competing teams such as the Steelers and 49ers . Some in the media may have their beef with Jerry Jones or other people in the organization , but I think the strong anti-Dallas emotion is mainly among the fans ( which is a tribute to the Cowboys being one of the top teams in the sport ) .",1

"when was the first time that butterfly stroke was done swimming ? Would like to know the first time that butterfly stoke was used in swimming and who invented it . In 1934 , however , David Armbruster , coach at the University of Iowa , devised a double overarm recovery out of the water . This `` butterfly '' arm action gave more speed but required greater training and conditioning . Then in 1935 , Jack Sieg , a University of Iowa swimmer , developed the skill of swimming on his side and beating his legs in unison like a fish 's tail . He then developed the leg action face down . Armbruster and Sieg combined the butterfly arm action with this leg action and learned to coordinate the two efficiently . With two kicks to each butterfly arm action , Sieg swam 100 yards in 1:00.2 . This kick was named the dolphin fishtail kick.Even though the butterfly breaststroke , as it was called , was faster than the breaststroke , the dolphin fishtail kick was declared a violation of competitive rules . For the next 20 years , champion breaststrokers used an out-of-water arm recovery ( butterfly ) with a shortened breaststroke kick . In 1953 , the butterfly stroke with the dolphin kick was legalized as a separate stroke for competition . Many swimmers say the `` wiggle '' is the key to the stroke and that a swimmer who can undulate through the water naturally can more easily learn the butterfly .",1

"Does anyone know anything about skydiving ? How about in Kansas ? There are actually five skydiving centers in Kansas ( see the United States Parachute Association web page http : //www.uspa.org/dz/states/KS.htm.I happen to be slightly bias , as I ’ m the Drop Zone Owner of one of the five ; Air Capital Drop Zone http : //www.aircapitaldropzone.com located 10 miles SE of Wichita Kansas.Basically there are two types of first jump ; Tandem , you ’ ll be attached with a Tandem Skydiving Instructor ( two people , one system ) . You ’ ll freefall from generally above 10,000 ’ down to between 5,000 ’ , and 6,000 ’ or approximately 30 seconds ( one mile at 120 mph ) . Round canopies are a thing of the past ; you ’ ll descend under a high performance rectangular wing ( ram air canopy ) to a soft landing . Cost generally ranges from the $ 170 range in Kansas , to $ 230 or so on the east or west coast.Solo , of which there are two forms being the old standard Static Line training method , and Accelerated Freefall ( AFF ) . For Static line you ’ ll have a 4 to 6 hour ground school , then you ’ ll jump from 4,000 ’ and your main parachute will start deployment as you fall away from the airplane . The “ accelerated ” in refers to the fact that you ’ ll freefall with a solo rig ( as opposed to tandem ) on your first jump . The ground training generally runs a couple of hours longer than the Static Line training , but you ’ ll exit from again above 10 ’ 000 ’ with two AFF instructors physically holding onto you for the freefall portion of your skydive . With both methods , once you ’ re under an open canopy , you ’ ll have assistance from the ground.There are methods which incorporate , and mix the methods . With “ Tandem Progressing ” you ’ ll be required to do a minimum of 3 tandem skydives , and then you ’ ll move into the AFF progression . The United States Parachute Association is the non government member association for skydiving in the US . You ’ re required to complete 25 freefalls to qualify for your first USPA license.Modern skydiving is very safe compared to its roots in the early days . Every skydiver is required to jump with two canopies ; a main and reserve . The main canopy malfunction rate is 1 in 1,000 +/- , and is generally related to the fact that they are cutting edge , high performance . The malfunction rate for reserves is in the range of wining the lottery . In the United States there are generally 20 to 30 skydiving fatalities ( of one million plus jumps ) , well in excess of 99 % of these fatalities are attributed to pilot error.MartinAC DZ",1

"Why did Brett Favre choke this year ? Farve tried to do too much with a team ravaged by injuries . The Packers lost their top 3 running backs , and their top WR to injuries during the season . Add to that the losses to their OL to free agency before the season started and a terribile defense to begin with and you can see why the future hall of fame QB felt the need to try and lift the team onto his back . They lost a bunch of close games early and jusdt could not overcome later on .",1

"I am looking for info . for river catfishing in the mountains of North Carolina . There is not many fish. ? The river is the French Broad river basin in Madison , Co. NC . I am not really familiar with mountain river fishing , but I 'll go out on a limb and say that if there is n't a lot of catfish , then maybe the water is too cool where you are fishing.Cats are warm water lovers for the most part ( unless you are fishing for blues in the winter ) so maybe try a river system that is a little warmer.A writer , who was obviously smarter than me , cause I ca n't recall his name , said that catfish and trout do n't mix , so if you are fishing a trout stream , try fishing farther downstream where the river warms up .",1

"Would you ever want to attend the Super Bowl ? Why or why not ? I most likely would never want to attend the Super Bowl for three reasons . First , the cost . The cost of one Super Bowl ticket is expensive and with the money that I could pay for one Super Bowl ticket , I could purchase a High Definition Television . Second , I would have to deal with a lot of crowds at the event . Although it would be a dream to attend the Major League Baseball All-Star Game but with the Super Bowl , you have to get to the game early and there is going to be more people attending a Super Bowl than a baseball All-Star Game . Finally , it might be more expensive to attend at Super Bowl after you pay for accommodations for about three day and attending all the Super Bowl events that the host city has to offer . If I ever did want to attend the Super Bowl , I would like to see the Super Bowl in Detroit , Atlanta , Chicago , and in Cleveland . Yes if the Redskins were in it .",1

"I want to become cricket umpire , please let me know how i have to start with . Thanks ? I am a professional and an avid follower of the game of cricket . I have this fascination to become a professional cricket umpire and I dream to become a member of the elite panel of umpires of ICC someday . I would like to know how to get started so as to be able to realise my dream . I am not at all aware about the procedure to be followed in this regard . Kindly guide me on the same . Introduction to international umpires and refereesOne of the ICC 's key priorities is to ensure that international umpires and referees perform at the highest standards possible . The ICC appoints the world 's best officials to the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires and Referees and provides an assessment and support system to aid umpires and referees in their development . The ICC has four officiating panels : • The Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires ; • The Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Referees ; • The Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires ; and• The ICC Associates and Affiliates Umpires Panel.The role of a cricket umpire is one of the hardest officiating tasks in international sport and sometimes calls are made for technology to play a greater role in cricket , but the ICC believes it is important not to override the basic philosophy that cricket is a game and human umpires are part of that game . The ICC is committed to trialing technological innovations but technology will only be introduced into the game if it : • can provide conclusive answers ; • is practical to introduce for all international cricket ; • does not compromise the role of on-field umpires ; and• does not change the essence in which the game is played.Becoming a member of the Emirates Elite and International Panel of ICC UmpiresTo become a member of the Emirates Elite or International Panels of ICC Umpires , officials must be standing regularly in first-class cricket in a Full Member country of the ICC.From the list of first-class umpires , each country nominates their two best-performing umpires to the Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires , and their next best to the position of TV Umpire.Members of the Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires are then eligible to be chosen for ICC events such as the ICC Cricket World Cup , ICC U/19 Cricket World Cup and the ICC Champions Trophy.They can also be appointed from time to time to stand in Test matches to provide cover for members of the Elite panel . The ICC closely monitors the performance of these umpires at international cricket . Those that show that they have the qualities to perform at the highest level , may then be invited to become full-time members of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires .",1

"What is the largest wave ever ridden by a surfer ? When , where and by whom ? I know Greg Noll had his pic taken on a wave 40+ feet high at Wiamea Bay . Since that famous shot was taken I have heard about places off Baja , possibly Todos Santos , which is accessible only by boat and jet skiis . Some of the surf there gets up to 65 feet . Could that be the place ? ? I do n't know . If you have any pictures or can provide a website where I can find this info it would be appreciated . Thanks ! ! It depends on what you define as `` riding a wave '' . There are `` tow-in '' sufers who rely on `` jetskis '' to tow them into waves . These waves are so large and travel so fast that it is impossible for a human-propelled board to match its speed . The traditionalist of the sport do not consider that truly `` surfing the wave '' . There is a contest that awards , both the surfer and photographer a monetary award if they can produce a picture proving they rode the biggest wave . I do know in the past that a prize was awarded to a team capturing a picture at Todos Santos . Peahi aka Jaws , off of Maui is arguably the largest waves ridden . Check out the site below to get an idea of what monsters these guys are riding . Traditional surfing or tow-in , these waves are huge ! ! ! ! http : //www.billabongxxl.com/06/index.asp ? regid=NA",1

"does lifting weights during basketball season affect your shot at all ? my shot has been off recently and one of my friends thought it might be form lifting weights so i thought id check it out . Unfortunately , the buffing up does affect your shot . This is because the added muscle mass if you try to go up in amount of weight will cause the power you put behind your shot to increase . You should always lift in the off-season , and keep a consistent lower amount to lift to maintain tone during the season . Say go up 5 lbs . a week before season and stay 15 lbs under your max through the season to stay tone . Also , do n't lift everyday , let muscles relax so they can stay healthy , they are anerobic .",1
"Is LeBron James the next Michael Jordan ? Both number 23 ... Well , the thing that made Jordan great was not his skills . Yes he was a great player ( possibly one of the top two along with Wilt Chamberlain ) , he was a complete player . He could do everything excellently . He scored 30 points per game , grabbed over 5 boards , 3-4 assits , 2-3 steals , and even one season averaged a block per game . He was an all-around excellent player . There are other players even in his era who had just as many skills and were just as talented with natural ability . Scottie Pippen I think had more natural potential as was more graceful . Certainly Dominique Wlikens was more powerful.The thing that made Jordan great was his intelligence and his primacy ; his ability to get up for a game and take it to the next level . He thrived on pressure . He could get into another players head and totally shut them down from the inside out . When the game was on the line he took the game to another emotional level that had so much stress and pressure to it that every other opposing player was crushed by it and all his teammates fed off of it . Jordan 's natural talent was limited . He was n't even picked for his high school team the first time around . Lebron only went to high school . He is not mentally the same player as Jordan , and he never will be .",1

"What is a triple double and a double double ? A triple double is hard to get - but it can be done . In basketball , one needs to get double digits in 3 categories - it can be in any statistical category that is recorded . Most likely , you 'll hear about a triple double as in , 26 points , 12 assists , and 10 rebounds . As you can see , that 's 3 categories , all in double digits . Now , a double double is simply two categories in double digits . Let 's say someone scored 9 points , but got 11 rebounds and 10 blocks . That 's a double double . Then again , if that person could get 11 points , the 11 boards and 10 blocks , but also was able to get 10 or more assists , that 's a quadruple double ! Hope this helps !",1

"Who ran the fastest forty ever at the combine ? A couple of my guesses would be Deion , Darrell Green , maybe even Mike Vick . Also , who do you think ran the fastest forty ever ... .not just at the combine . There is no official world record for 40 yards.The shortest distance that the IAAF , track and field 's international governing body , recognizes for world-record purposes is an indoor 50 meters , or about 54 yards . It is 5.56 seconds and it was set by Canadian sprinter Donovan Bailey in 1996 . There is also a world record for 60 meters -- 6.39 seconds by American Maurice Greene in 1998.But it is another Canadian , Ben Johnson , who is believed to have run 40 yards faster than any human in history . Johnson is best known for injecting copious amounts of steroids and winning the 100 meters at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul in 9.79 seconds , only to have his gold medal and world record stripped after failing a post-race drug test.Timing officials have since broken down that famed race into 10-meter increments , and Johnson was so preposterously fast that he went through 50 meters in 5.52 seconds and 60 meters in 6.37 -- both under the current world records at those distances . He went through 40 yards that day in 4.38 seconds.He was running in spikes . . . on a warm afternoon perfectly suited for sprinting . . . with a slight tailwind . . . with years of training from arguably track 's top coach , Charlie Francis . . . with Carl Lewis and six others of the fastest men on the planet chasing him . . . with 69,000 people roaring at Seoul 's Olympic Stadium . . . with hundreds of millions of people watching on TV . . . with the ultimate prize in sports , an Olympic gold medal , at stake.And , as we learned later , with muscles built with the assistance of the anabolic steroid stanazolol.Four-point-three-eight seconds.Then again , maybe Ben Johnson is n't the fastest 40-yard man in the world.Maybe half the NFL is faster.o o oIt can be the most important few hours of a football player 's career . It is the day NFL scouts come to campus to determine whether prospects have what it takes to play at the next level.Players are measured to the quarter-inch . They 're weighed to the half-pound . They do a vertical jump and a standing broad jump . They see how many times they can bench-press 225 pounds . They do a 20-yard shuttle drill and something called a three-cone drill . They are put through a short workout specific to their position.But it is something else that commands everyone 's attention , something else that interrupts the businesslike atmosphere of players shuffling from one station to the next . Something else that causes scouts and spectators to snap to attention.The 40-yard dash.It is the day 's shortest event , and the most critical . No other statistic carries more influence for an NFL prospect , no single number has more impact on his draft fortunes . It 's not called Pro Scouting Day or Pro Prospect Day or Pro Workout Day . The sign taped to the weight-room door at San Diego State on March 19 says : `` Pro Timing Day . `` Or as local football agent David Caravantes puts it : `` There 's football speed and there 's 40 speed , and the scouts will all tell you they understand that and game film is the most important thing . But how many defensive backs who ran a 4.6 are left on the draft board ahead of guys who ran 4.3 ? `` I 'll give you another example . There 's this DB who was originally projected as a first-rounder . But he did n't run the 40 that fast -- something like 4.6 instead of in the 4.4s -- and now they 're talking about him slipping to the second round . Well , he 's looking at a minimum $ 4 million signing bonus if he goes in the first round and only about $ 1.6 million if he goes in the middle of the second round . `` You do the math . `` The players are inside the SDSU weight room being measured and weighed . In the hallway outside are their agents , pacing . Nervously . Occasionally they 'll walk outside , look up at the sky and stick out an upturned hand to feel the raindrops.This is not good .

"I am trying to start a Pro Wrestling Promotion in New Jersey . Can anyone give me any info on how to do so ? Here are the best steps to start your own promotion in any city.1 . When searching for wrestlers try to find good fresh wrestlers about 15 good wrestlers in your area , then find 10 more people who got the desire to become wrestlers then , have 5 of your good wrestlers to train them in order to have full roster.2 . DO NOT OVERPAY YOUR WRESTLERS you just starting to get in the business and alot of small feds have gone out of business because they overpay.You have to eat too , start paying about $ 10 a head but depends on how many people attends your show for example : A . 50 to 100 people=0.00 payB . 101 to 125 people=10.00 payC . 126 10 150 people=15.00 payThis is just a basic round example3 . When looking for wrestlers , keep you search local , which brings you back to the pay section , if you have wrestlers coming from either another county or state nine times over ten those wrestlers want more pay for gas and food.Keep it local.4 . Do not charge big ticket prices on your first two years of business.Wrestling fans will not pay a big ticket price for a fed they have n't heard beforeI have more advice , if you need them just email me @ tonyjenkynx @ excite.com or call at 205-986-2038 or email your number and i 'll call you.Tony",1

In 1954 , when he was seven years old , he used a push broom to help keep a pile of burning trash in place . When the job was done he returned the broom to the garage , unaware that its brushes were still smoldering . A spark ignited a can of nearby gasoline , which exploded in front of him . His 11-year old brother , Barrett , saved him by rolling him around on the ground , but Frank was left with burns on the right side of his neck , chest and his shoulders . Over the next few years he endured dozens of painful skin grafts and was left with permanent scarring .",1

"how does one learn to swim well ? I can manage to go swim about 20 mtrs but i am exhausted and cant go any further . Can someone point me to good online swimming lessons and techniques for amateurs . If you are trying to swim freestyle ( crawl ) , switch to an easier stroke , like the sidestroke while you increase your endurance . If you can only swim 20m , then swim 20m , rest , and swim 20m again . Repeat that process . You can time your rests and shorten your rests as you get stronger and increase the number of repititions you do each session . After a while , push yourself to do 40m between stops , then 60 , etc.In my experience , if you can work up to 400m without stopping , you will be past the point where you are struggling in the water.It might be a good idea to have someone look at your stroke and tell you what needs correcting . If you are struggling to make 20m . there are probably a lot of things that you can do to make your stroke more efficient . Find out what they are and work on correcting one thing at a time . Find someone who 's swimming laps when you are at pool , someone who 's stroke looks good , and ask them to look at your stroke . Ask them what the worst thing that you are doing and what they think you should do about it . You 'd be suprised how many people would be happy to help you .",1

The actual mascot is a mountain lion , but is referred to as a Nittany Lion because Penn State rests in the Nittany Valley at the foot of Mt . Nittany , the lion was called a Nittany Lion .",1
"How much is my McCoy surfboard worth ? It is used , it has the handwriting `` 'MEGA ' < | > FOR RICH `` on the bottom , a circular McCoy design on front .

"If a woodchuck were to actually chuck wood , what is the quantity of the wood that would be chucked ? I despise those who do n't take your question seriously . I bit my thumb at them . Fie.The answer depends on what you mean the woodchuck , a common name for groundhogs and woodpeckers . If you mean groundhogs , then the answer is unfortunately quite a small amount of wood . My guess is probably two logs an hour . Small logs.According to the prominent wikipedia.org : `` The name woodchuck has nothing etymologically to do with wood . It stems from an Algonquian name for the animal ( possibly Narraganset ) , wuchak . This confusion led to the common tongue twister , 'How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood ? — A woodchuck would chuck all the wood he could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood .

"What items do I need for winter camping to stay warm ? A nice pair of silk long johns is a good place to start . Other little treats for yourself include down clothing , they even make pants . I have a pair of down booties for use in the sleeping bag . Other little clothing tidbits . Wear a hat at all times , even sleeping . You can also sleep with a warm water bottle . Some cautions with this : make sure you know whether the bottle leaks and Nalgene 's are notoriously leaky , if you or your bag gets wet , you may be having a harder time keeping warm . If so you can contain it in a ziplock bag or a roll down velcro closure bag . If the water is too hot , you should put it in a sock or something to keep from burning your skin . My hiking buddy/co worker went to bed with a hot water nalgene between his thighs one night . He thought that was clever because a LOT of blood passes through there and warm blood travels to other parts of the body , warming them . But he woke up with blisters on his thighs ... dangerously close to the family jewels . Last word about hot water bottle , if you use a collapsible canteen or bottle , make sure you fill it allllll the way up , because even then your bottle will cave in as the water cools down . At the very least you want to minimize this so you do n't ruin your bottle . If the bottle cools this way , it will never hold as much as it used to.A good camping mat . The closed cell foam ones that roll up are cheap and effective and very lightweight , the next step up is the self inflating ones but they are heavier . And you can buy covers for those inflating mats that convert them into a chair.You need to dress warm . The most effective thing in my opinion , and also more versatile , is to dress in multiple light layers . In the winter , I wear about 8 layers in the coldest weather ... long john shirt , tee shirt , maybe a button down shirt , a fleece vest , as many fleece crewneck tops ( the fuzzy polartec type , not sweathshirt fleece ) as I can pile on , and my rain jacket . The good news is that if I can add or remove pieces at will until I am perfectly comfortable . IF you go the other route of a couple indoor layers and then one big poofy piece you need to understand the principles of loft , which includes your sleeping bag.Loft is the way insulation in a comforter , parka , or sleeping bag works . They create tiny little air pockets around you and hold YOUR OWN body heat in them . IF you have a lot of clothing between you and the insulating item , you will actually defeat the purpose of the item because you insulate the item FROM your body heat . This is why many things are true : it is better to sleep with fewer clothing items when you want to be warmer in the bag . It is also important not to compromise loft by choosing an item that does n't fit your body and causes you to squash it from the inside out , or with a bunch of heavy layers on top of it to squash it from the outside in . If you compress your item too much , even in storage , or in your pack or its stuff sack , there are fewer air pockets formed and the item does n't work as well.SO choose ONE dressing strategy and know how to apply it.Other important facts : All the things discussed so far are only ways to insulate yourself . They are not generating any heat on their own . To do that , you need to DRINK plenty of water , and you need to EAT , warm foods that are high in sugars and fats are excellent , and you need to MOVE . A bedtime snack can be anything from a candy bar to a stick of butter , NO kidding ! A bedtime activity could be a couple minutes jumping up and down , then one last go at the fire . AND YOU MUST DRINK WATER . Even if you ca n't stand cold liquids . EVEN IF you do n't want to be up all night peeing . Your body needs the water to circulate the blood , and to metabolize food , both of which assist you in staying warm . Another thing you need to know about water is that both dehydration and hypothermia have the early warning sign of disorientation and confusion . The trouble is , if YOU are the one",1

"Is cheerleading a sport ? And if you do n't belive so , why not ? It really does get unfair sometimes that people do n't believe cheerleading is a sport . Cheerleaders have this bad reputation , but really , we 're nothing like that . If only people just knew how hard we work , and how much pressure we have on us , then they would believe it 's a sport . We work our asses off ! It 's a sport ! Get used to it ! ! Please find Heather Jeffries , M.P.A opinion here : Most cheerleaders say “ YES ” while state and school officials say “ no. ” According to the National Federation of High School Athletic Associations , seventeen to twenty states of the United States consider cheerleading a sport . Why is the question , “ Is cheerleading a sport ? ” such a controversial issue to anyone not involved with the sport ? According to MSN Encarta , the definition of sport is an individual or group competitive activity involving physical exertion or skill , governed by rules , and sometimes engaged in professionally . Because cheerleading follows every aspect defined under the word sport , it is my belief that cheerleading should be defined as an actual sport.The word cheerleader no longer means a sideline of squads that exist solely to support other sporting teams . Cheer teams are teams in their own right . College and high school cheer teams competefor national titles just as football , basketball , baseball , etc . Cheerleaders are recruited for college scholarships that have been known to exceed amounts awarded to other sports teams . Some cheer teams put in more hours in the gym than teams such as football and basketball . Cheerleaders have to be in just as good physical condition as any other sport participant.Cheerleading in the early years was nothing like the sport it is today . Over the past few decade cheerleading has evolved from leading audiences with simple arm movements to treacherous towers of humans and elaborate dances that are used to show the athleticism of cheerleaders . Cheerleading has developed from selections based on popularity to one that now claims some of the more talented athletes in the school/program.Cheerleaders are not seen as athletes , but seen as being athletic . Cheerleaders are very specialized athletes . Most do not understand the skill and athleticism required by cheerleading . The gymnastics ability , power and strength make cheerleaders some of the more wellrounded athletes in sports . Cheerleading not only teaches coordination and helps condition competitors , but it also teaches teamwork , leadership , communication skills , organizational skills , productivity and much more.Cheerleading contributes to the overall physical fitness of those involved . Many teams are in the gym four to six days a week working out , practicing , stretching and conditioning for upcoming performances or competitions . Running increases one ’ s lung power and endurance . Stretching , jumping , taking gymnastics and aerobics all help keep the body toned and healthy . So as you can see , cheerleading practice and workouts are much like those of other sports.When it comes to funding issues , the sport of cheerleading is not equally supported . Monies are contributed to sports that do not consistently perform well . Cheer teams that do perform well usually do not receive the monetary compensations for their performances . Scholarships , donations from alumni , and extra funding to the school rarely get distributed to the cheer programs . Programs known for winning national titles over several years occasionally receive monies . I believe this occurs only once the administration realizes the need to keep those athletes in their program . Cheerleading does not bring the revenue to schools like football games ; however , the publicity that some cheer teams contribute to the school can be profitable in other ways.As a former cheerleader myself , I remember having long and strenuous practices which seemed to last forever . Because my life was so into cheerleading , I did and still consider cheerleading a sport . I have always told people who I ’ ve talked to about cheerleading that I consider it to be a sport . After being exposed to the competitiveness of cheerleading , I stand stronger behind my beliefs in the sport of cheerleading.Being a co-owner and one of the head coaches for Clarksville Cheer Extreme , an all star cheerleading gym in Clarksville , Tenn",1

"How do you change direction when swimming freestyle in a pool ? You know what I mean : good swimmers just kind of do a 180 and then kick off in the opposite direction . It 's clear that you have to flip over and turn over , but I find it tricky . I 'm generally very coordinated , so I think I just need some tips . A flip turn is done by basically gliding into the wall and flipping into a back-stroke glid and eventually turning back onto your front . With your momentum carrying you into the wall , tuck your head under so your upper torso will be on its back . Your legs will follow over and the momentum will carry your legs into the wall . In the glide position on your back slowly turn back onto your front . As you improve and get your orientation you will be able to flip while on your side , and will be able to more efficiently do your turn . Things to watch when turning , work on your timing coming into the wall . You will need to be able to judge when you should start your flip turns , that 's what the T on the lane lines are for . Keep from going to deep when doing your turns . Keep your body stream lined into the wall and coming off the wall . Think of your body as hinged at your hips and keep both halves extended when flipping - only the hinge bends . Good luck .",1

"why did terry bradshaw not appear with the mvp 's in the super bowl ? When the NFL unveiled its MVPs from the previous 39 Super Bowls , only three living members skipped the ceremony.Former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana and former Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw decided to stay home , while former Dolphins MVP Jake Scott was traveling in Australia.Montana , the league 's only three-time Super Bowl MVP , and Bradshaw reportedly turned down the invitation over money.Both denied the reports.In a phone interview with ESPN2 's Cold Pizza on Monday night , Montana vehemently denied forgoing the ceremony over money and reiterated that his absence was due to his preference to see his son 's basketball game.He 'd told Cold Pizza last week he was n't going to be at the game because his son had an important basketball game he wanted to attend .

"how can i jump higher so that I can dunk a basketball ? I am a 6 foot 1 Asian basketball player.I want tips to increase my vertical so that I can dunk . I asked my weight training coach back-in-the-day , and he suggested the following exercise regimen . Go somewhere with those outdoor tables with the attached bench ( like in the lunch areas at schools ) . Then jump up on the bench , then up to the table , then down on the bench on the far side , then down to the ground . Turn around , and repeat . Do this as much as you can , and then work to increase how much you can do it . ( I ca n't comment on its efficacy , because I 'm a lazy punk and I do n't play basketball -- I just resented seeing people 5 '' shorter and with an addition 5 '' less in terms of reach being able to dunk when I could barely touch halfway up the net ) .",1

"Will a turbo fit on a carburettor engin ? Will a turbo fit on a carburettor engin , and if so will it be as effective as with fuel injection engines ? If you know will you please tell me what mods I have to do on my engine if I put a low presure turbo on . Turbos can ( and have ) been put on carb 'd cars . However , due to the increased control using today 's electronics , I ca n't see them as being as effective as FI turbocharged . When you increase the airflow to the engine ( turbocharging and supercharging are forced induction ) you must increase the fuel as well , otherwise you will end up in an incredibly lean condidtion and damage the motor . Motors work best with a specific air/fuel ratio . With carbs you must re jet for the best compromised AFR . With FI you can `` map '' the fuel to maintain the best AFR over the entire range of RPM . Other mods will include oiling system changes ( you need to make sure the turbo will live ) . Hope this helps .",1

My Brother in law ( who I love very much ) is a big , burly biker who co-owns a strip bar ... .and NASCAR , foootball and yes.. loves Curling ... .I do n't get it ... . I think because anything classified as a sporting event it requires a certain degree of athleticism , skill , practice , dedication , and ( in the case of team sports ) team-work ; add in an opportunity to test your levels against others to find out who is best and you have a sporting event ( you mentioned NASCAR in your question details ... driving a car in a big circle for a couple of hours does n't require much athleticism either , but it is still considered a sport , right ? ) Now why it is considered an Olympic event ... well , it is a sport with growing popularity in many countries that participate in the Olympics ( Canada , many of the northern European countries , and a growing fan-base in the northern United States ) , and the Olympics have been a fairground for countries to show off new and/or unusual sporting events from around the world ( Ice Dancing ... the poor-man 's figure skating OR `` I 'm just doing this until Disney-on-Ice calls me in for an interview ! '' ) . Some of the events catch on and become world-wide phenomenons , others fizzle and die. < Added > I added athleticism to the list of skills needed because there is a degree of athleticism to curling that you do n't find in other strategy games ( chess , for example ) . I mean , watch the curlers in the Olympics . They are running around on ICE for Pete 's sake ! Any time I step on ice I fall on my ... personality ... but these guys are running up and down the ice as if they were walking in the grass ! And it is n't just the shoes they wear .

"How many jumps are there in each set of volleyball match for each player ? At lower levels of play , e.g. , recreational leagues , the number of jumps varies by the player 's ability . The best players ( on recreational teams ) gets the lion-share of the sets , and thus , jumps a lot more than others . The ratio between best and worst players on the court could mean 25 jumps to zero . Additionally , the offense usually consists of `` high outside '' sets , with no `` quick attack '' in the middle , and thus , reduced the number of jumps required to block . However , at higher levels of play , the number of jumps varies by position more than ability . The least number of jumps go the outside hitters , both power and weak-side ( a/k/a , `` opposite '' ) . Their numbers are roughly inverses of each other , for obvious positional reasons . Figure 9-12 spike attempts for power hitters , and 4-7 blocks ; the opposite hitter gets the opposite numbers : 4-7 spike attempts , and 9-12 spikes . The lion-share of jumps go to the middle hitters , who ( usually ) jump on every volley , because they need to jump before the setter sets the ball . Additionally , they participate in every block . Figure they get about 12-25 spike jumps , and the same number of blocks . Hope this very un-scientific answer helps .",1

"what is a brake lining ? Brake linings are composed of a relatively soft but tough and heat-resistant material with a high coefficient of dynamic friction ( and ideally an identical coefficient of static friction ) typically mounted to a solid metal backing using high-temperature adhesives or rivets . The complete assembly ( including lining and backing ) is then often called a brake pad or brake shoe . In this view of an automobile disc brake , the brake pad is the black material held by the red metal component ( the brake caliper ) . The brake lining is that part of the brake pad which actually contacts the metal rotor when the brake is engaged.Using a typical bicycle brake as an example , the backing would be the metal shell which provides mechanical support , and the lining would be the rubbery portion which contacts the rims when the brakes are applied . In most modern vehicular applications the system is conceptually identical , except the rims would be replaced with solid steel ( or sometimes exotic metal ) rotors . Furthermore , a metal tang is usually incorporated into the pad assembly . The tang contacts the rotors when the linings are worn out , causing an annoying noise designed to alert the motorist that brake servicing is required.Since the lining is the portion of the braking system which converts the vehicle 's kinetic energy into heat , the lining must be capable of surviving high temperatures without excessive wear ( leading to frequent replacement ) or outgassing ( which causes brake fade , a decrease in the stopping power of the brake ) . Due to its suitability , asbestos is often a component in brake linings ; as a result , brake dust should never be inhaled",1

"How frequently do I use grunt and anteler calls while deer hunting in the rut ? It all depends on where you are hunting and what the buck to doe ratio is . If you are hunting on public property and the buck to doe ratio is 1/5 or worse you will want to be very timid with your calling . For one there is not much competition for does so the fighting does not occur as much and for two if you are on a heavily hunted area and other people are calling wrong or overcalling all they are doing is educating the deer and they will not respond as well to the calling . If you are hunting on private property or in an area where the buck to doe ratio is 1/3 or better the rules will change . You can be more aggressive and make more mistakes and they will not be as costly . I was watching the outdoor channel the other day ( ca n't remember wich program ) but this guy in texas was rattling and grunting constantly , I could n't believe how aggressive he was being and how constant he was doing it , but it was working very effectively . The ranch he was hunting though only allowed the taking of 2-3 deer a year though and the buck to doe ratio was 1/2 . One last comment is that i believe the pre-rut all the way to when the does are just starting to go in to estruess is the best time to grunt and rattle",1

I need to also learn a way to heal my leg quick and well for practice cause i fucced it up real bad at school play running back today . The kids want me to win them a tropy next year so im gon na do it . There are only a handfull of base plays that beginners need to know : Belly , Option , Sweep and Iso . Each play has its variations . There are at least thirty base option plays that have their own variations.The important thing is to know the basic idea of each . Play Madden , watch the games on TV , play with your buddies . More important than knowing the plays are your fundamental skills . Running the ball is a fraction of what backs need to do for their team to be successful . You will need to block , catch and run to contribute to your team . Check out the site below for drills , plays and info . You can even check out a play from each NFL team 's actual playbook.If you would be more specific about your injury I could help you more . Remember R-I-C-E : Rest it/Ice it/Compress it ( w/tape or a wrap ) /Elevate it . Every great running back needs a motto .

He knew how to bob and weave right under an opponent 's punches and come back with vicious combos to the head and body.However , I do n't think any heavyweight boxer ever could outbox Ali . Muhammad Ali knew how to use the ring and could use his reach advantage to keep Tyson at the perfect distance to land punches while avoiding being hit himself . Not that I do n't think Ali could n't take Tyson 's punches , but those body shots would have worn him down a bit by the later rounds.Overall , I say an unanimous decision victory for Ali , though not a very impressive one .",1

"Is something wrong with YAHOO Fantasy sports ? ? I am not sure what exactly you mean . If you mean technical problems ? well sometimes the log in page doesn ' load and I have to refresh the page a few times . That seems to be a Yahoo problem in generalif you mean the game itself , it is generally good but I would suggest some improvements.1- the number one improvement that is absolutely necessary is the IR/IL lists . Sometimes other website report that certain players , eg . Ed Jovonavski or Amare Stoudomire have been put on the IR . Yahoo however , does n't follow suit immidiately , they are a few days late . They have to keep in mind that those few days are very important for some of us . 2- KEPPER LEAGUE OPTION : I play Keeper leagues , meaning that I have inherited a team and its minor league system ( in case of hockey ) . I get to trade draft picks , prospects and active players . I think it would be better if Yahoo had a keeper league option . a ) That way we would n't have to set up a new league every season . b ) I 'd also suggest that they have a minor league section as part of this keeper league option . We could then keep our prospects who are not yet part of the NHL on our minor league roster . That way no other GM accidentally picks these guys up and also we wo n't forget about one of our many prospects . c ) When trades occure , they need to announce to the other GM 's all parts of the trade . As you know , when you trade in Yahoo leagues , it also gives the GM an comment box in which people that play keeper leagues put names of prospects or draft picks . As it 's currently set , these comments do n't appear to the other GM 's when the trade is accepted . For us the active players that are exchanged is one thing , most of the time it 's the draft picks and prospects that are the real deal makers . Right now GMs have to post extra comments letting everyone else know of the trade . IMO that needs to change.that 's it for now till I think of other things .",1

"My friend is a marathon runner and he is getting cramps at mile 18 . What can he do ? He has run 4 marathons. ? Cramps are usually the result of mineral depletion . Others have advised about replenishing water and sodium , but overlook the importance of potassium , and , to a lesser extent , magnesium . While in training , he should have his potassium level checked to see if it is well within normal range ( 4.0 to 5.0 ) If not , he should ask his doctor about possible daily supplements . If it is normal , he should consider potassium loading before the race ( good foods include bananas , sweet potatoes , oranges ) and then supplementing during the race , either with pills ( preferably with a doctor 's OK ) , or , if his gastro system can handle it , orange juice or other high potassium fluids ; most sports drinks have only trace amounts of potassium . I 've run a few marathons and run at a relaxed pace , and thus it does n't bother my stomach to drink a quart of OJ an hour before the race and a pint at mile 14 ( supplied by a waiting family member ) , and this has helped reduce cramping a lot - I used to get severe charley horses at mile 19 . Tell your friend to search potassium loading on the web , there are a few references to it in marathon forums . The caveat is that a high potassium level is dangerous ; in people with normal kidney function , the kidney sloughs off any excess harmlessly ; but if renal function is impaired , high doses of potassium are contraindicated .",1

"How do you play tennis ? First , you get a partner and get on a tennis court . Then , at the start of the game , choose who will serve first.EX : You serve 1st . Start behind the bottom line of the court on you side . Hit the ball into the opposite square on your opponent 's side of the court . Make sure you do n't pass the little white line in the center . If you do n't in the first try , that is a fault . If the ball hits the top of the net and goes over to the other side , that is a let . Redo . No faults , no points . You get a second try . Try to hit the opposite square on your opponents side of the court . If you miss again , that is a double fault and your opponent gets a point . The score would say 0-15 . ( server 's score is always first ) Now , you switch sides ( from one square to the other ) If you succeed , and he/she ca n't return it , that is called an ace . You get one point ( 15-15 ) Now you go back to where you started . ( It alternates each point ) Now , you serve , and your opponent hits it back to you . It has to go over the net , and in front the line from where you serve , and not in the two boxes at the sides of the court . ( Only in play for doubles ) It is 40-30 now . You score . You win the game . NOT THE WHOLE GAME ! The whole game is called a match . A match is seperated into sets , then games . You win the first set , ( out of your choise , 3 or 5 sets . ) 6-4 . ( 6 games to win a set and by 2 games . There is a tiebraker , but I do n't know that . Sorry . ) 2nd set : You win 7-5 . You win the Match .

The term `` Trolley Dodgers '' was attached to the Brooklyn ballclub due to the complex maze of trolley cars that weaved its way through the borough of Brooklyn . The name was then shortened to just `` Dodgers . '' During the 1890s , other popular nicknames were Ward 's Wonders , Foutz 's Fillies and Hanlon 's Superbas .",1

"Do non-smokers have rights too ? Yes , you non-smokers have rights too , but you give them away by allowing : 1 ) Smoking to be LEGAL , & 2 ) By allowing extra taxation on cigarettes to benefit all Americans . When will American ’ s stop being hypocrites to smokers by rapping smokers of their money and health and then yelling at smokers for providing tax money to all of America ? If we truly cared about America we would find ways to make tobacco illegal and give up the revenue from tobacco.PS : I have not had a cigarette for 12 Days . . . No I ’ m not moody from withdrawals , I just think American ’ s are hypocrites when it comes to smokers . Sin/Use taxes are somewhat better than illegalizing sin/use completely . At least then the ills caused by the sin or damage by the use are paid for by those doing the sin/use . Example : Road use..polution.. gas tax , is both a use and sin tax . Still Illegalizing sin is somewhat ( arguably ) better than flaunting immoral activities to our children . Sins will never be black or white issues they will allways be subjective . This is usually where society gets all messed up . We get on one or the other side and assume there is only one right answer in the Drugs , Right to live or die debates .

"Ladies , how do I ask my wife to dress sexier for me , wear make-up , and stillettos ? My guess is that you 're not talking about a day-to-day thing . What you want is for her to get dressed up and for you two to have crazy monkey sex . Awesome.If you two talk about your sex life , bring it up during one of those conversations . Say `` You know what might be fun to try one time ? `` Do n't try to change the whole of your sex life in a day . A good guideline is that only 1 in 3 sexual encounters with your partner should be `` enhanced '' or `` special '' . If you were to start asking her to dress up like a porn star every time you two made love , she would likely feel less than confident.If you two are open enough , head on over to a strip club . Buy her a lapdance . I went to a club and got one and it was superfun . I left the club thinking it might be fun to dress up like a stripper sometimes . Your wife might get the same ideas.However , if you bring it up and she says something along the lines of `` I 'm not a tawdry whore '' , make it clear that you want her to be beautiful and classy , just like she already is . If she still says no , drop it . The more you pressure her , the more she 'll feel like you do n't like her for who she is.Most women will agree to do something that they 're not entirely into every once in a while for the sake of their partner . Besides , if you respond enthusiastically , she 's more likely to do it again.Good luck !",0

"Why ca n't conservatives really learn to conserve more ? seems most conservatives are only interested in conserving a wasteful greedy life-style ... If you are talking about conserving energy - this will not solve the energy problem . It 's only part of the solution . What really solves the problem is drilling and refining our own sources of energy off of our coasts and in ANWR - but that wo n't happen because tree hugging pus*y liberals like yourself would rather block domestic energy production and then whine about gas prices being too high . That 's why there has n't been an oil refinery built in this country for over 30 years . That 's why they have brownouts in California . All because of the environmental movement and their hatred of Capitalism . Raising the supply of energy is a sure fire way to make sure we never run out.This is true of ANY commodity . Let 's take Coca Cola for example . The reason a 12oz can of Coke only costs 75 cents from a vending machine is because that is the price that the market will bear . Now , close every Coca-Cola bottling plant in the country except one and keep the same amount of vending machines - what do you think would happen to the price ? It would skyrocket because there would n't be enough Coke to fill the vending machine demand.On the other hand , if you openend up Coca-Cola bottling plants on every steet corner in America - there would be so much Coke available that the price would plummet because they would have more Coca-Cola than vending machines to dispense them.The same would be true whether you are talking about energy , Coca-Cola , steel , guns , butter or newspapers.Instead of spouting off from your a $ $ , maybe you should learn some Economic facts first .",0

Others may use the Weather Channel as their source.Each of these services use different computer models and different human beings interpreting the results of these models to create their forecasts.When I go skiing near Lake Tahoe , I go with the National Weather Service because their predictions seem the most accurate and they include weather predictions about the snow level . This is important because it tells me weather or not I 'll be stuck driving behind someone with chains and weather I 'll be skiing in rain/snow or dry , powdery snow .",0

"Does anyone know the easiest and quickest way to tell if any number is prime ? Going through possible factors is n't practical , and can take forever , so that 's not a viable choice . Also , any prime number has to end in 1 , 3 , 7 , or 9 , because otherwise it 's not prime . ( Even numbers are divisible by 2 and 5 just means it 's divisible by 5 ) I just had a math packet dealing with this topic . There are many equations out there that deal with finding primes , but all so far fail at a certain point in the sequence . The method you refer to , called the Sieve of Eratosthenes , was developed by its namesake in Greece sometime between the 500s and 350 B.C . and is so far the only proven method to find primes .

"What is the problem for scientists in explaining `` phantom limb '' ? The problem is that the brain is receiving signals , usually pain , that it thinks are coming from nerves that have been removed , by amputation , injury , or whatever reason . ( Phantom pain also occurs in the form of phantom tooth aches in people who have had all of their teeth removed . ) The question is where do the signals that the brain is receiving come from . There are several steps involved in getting a signal from the source , the sensory nerve ending , to the brain . The system of communication is so complex in the nervous system , it is hard to track exactly how the signal progresses through the body . Where the signal starts is unclear , because it can not start at the nerve ending .",0

"How does one approach a total jerk coach who is mean , unsensitve and hurtful to my daughter ? She is 16 and loves basket - but the coach ( who is the head of the association unfortunately ) is a horrible person . She refuses to quit the team but is terribly unhappy , sometimes cries , does n't want to talk about it in detail and does n't want us to talk to him . I wish she would quit but she refuses . I see her terribly upset - what can we do ? She thinks she can continue suffering , but I think he tries to get her to quit . A total unsensitive ... ... .. ! Well ... getting too involved will embarass your daughter and possibly even make it harder for her to stay on the team , which she obviously wants . Kudos to her for sticking withit even when it upsets her ! Make your presence known to the coach but dont try to confront him or tell him what to do . I am a swimming coach , and when a parent goes out of their way to thank me or let me know they appreciate what I am doing , then I am more positive to the kids as a whole . Try being ridiculously nice to the jerk . Come a little early to a practice one day and watch the end , and then when all the girls go to the locker rooms walk up to the coach , introduce yourself , and tell him that the kids seem to be doing such a wonderful job and that you are so pleased with the progress they are all making . Making yourself as NICE as possible will make it harder for him to be mean to your daughter.Then , tell your daughter how proud of her you are for sticking with it even when its hard for her . This is a big deal for someone so young , and it says a lot about her character . Good luck !",0

"Can someone please explain me the blowfish algorithm ? Hi , I am using the blowfish algorithm for my project . I read the paper that Bruce wrote , but couldnt understand it fully ... .Can please some explain it to me ? ? Please ... dont paste the same thing that is on the website , tell me what you understand ! Thankyou ! ! ! IT is a Copy Paste But may be of some use ... .BlowFishBlowFish/TwoFish is a widespread security algorithm , which was published by Bruce Schneier in the beginning of the year 1994 . This algorithm works similar to DES and it uses block coding with blocks of a size of 64 bit . BlowFish was spread very fast after its publication , due to the fact that Bruce Schneier is one of the most famous cryptology experts and that this algorithm can be used without licence fee . In addition , using this algorithm data can be en- and decoded with high speed . If the routine for BlowFish is implemented in software , a disk space of less than five kilobytes is sufficient . You can vary the size of the key as as you like up to 448 bit . That is why this algorithm with its 2 448 different possibilities is protected against any Brute Force Attacks . This is how the encryption algorithm BlowFish works : BlowFish defines two different S boxes , a P box and four S boxes . The P box P is a one-dimensional field with 18 32-bit-values . The boxes contain accidental values , which are implemented in the code or generated during each initialization . The S boxes S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 contain 256 32-bit-values each . The BlowFish initialization looks like this : The key string is converted into 32-bit-values . The entire content of the P box is substituted by the values xor ’ t . The P box is now encrypted like the S box . BlowFish encryption ( block size : 64 Bit , rounds ( r ) : 16 ) : The data element is divided into two parts L and R , each of 32 bit . L is xor ’ t with P r. R is xor ’ t with f ( L ) . L and R are interchanged . This is done 16 times , until r =16 . R is xor ’ t with P 17 . L is xor ’ t with P 18 . Explanation of function f : The incoming 32-bit-value ( L in this case ) is divided into four 8-bit-vectors X1 , X2 , X3 , X4 . With the help of these vectors a 32-bit-value is selected from every S box . The result is linked by addition and xor . For decoding data , the entire process is performed the other way round .",0

"what are the effects of the emergence of overseas filipino workers to the economy of the philippines ? One can certainly write a book about this topic , but here are a few consequences stemming from the increasing numbers of overseas Filipino workers , of OFWs.Sociological : many observers have noticed changes in the traditional family structure ; as a substantial portion of OFWs are women , they often work abroad to send money home to put their children through school ; thus , children often live in single parent households where the primary breadwinner is absent and gender roles are reversed , i.e . the mother is the breadwinner , while the father takes on the role of homemaker.Economic : overseas remittances are important in keeping the Philippines ' balance of payments in surplus ; as such , this preserves the level of reserve assets held by the Philippines , thus contributing to debt sustainability ( the country is one of the largest issuers of sovereign debt in the developing world ) and propping up the exchange rate ( thanks in part to the large inflow of overseas remittances from OFWs , the Philippine peso was one of the strongest performers vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar in 2005 ) .Political : given their increased importance in the economy , OFWs have rightly gained increased influence as a political constituency -- up until 2004 , overseas Filipinos were denied the right to vote ; because of their large numbers -- some estimates go as high as 8 million -- their vote could potentially swing an election ; however , as evidenced by the low turnout by eligible overseas Filipino voters in 2004 , huge logistics problems need to be tackled to fulfill that potential .",0

"how do i score a 750+ + score for the GMAT ? Which courses , books etc should I use ? The GMAT is essentially a glorified SAT - all the stuff in there you definitely learned pre-college . I 've never been a big proponent of the GMAT classes because I feel you can get everything out of the book . The class is n't going to teach you some random formula you do n't already know . Both the books and classes essentially spell out what format of questions will be asked in each section . Then they drill you on that format repeatedly until solving for that type of equation or that grammatical structure is second nature no matter what weird way they ask it on the test . I would recommend getting one of the books , Kaplan is pretty much the industry standard . Read it all the way through . Then take every practice test in the book , then save a few bucks and go hang out in the bookstore and take a half a dozen practice tests in other GMAT prep books . Review every question on your test you got wrong and go back into the book to see what “ format ” of question it is and review that again . Then use the free CDROM that should come with your prep book to focus in on any sections you are bombing on the practice tests . This worked for me and one of my buddies . We studied for about two weeks for an average of 3 hours a day and topped out over 750 . The MCAT would be another story…thank god I don ’ t want to be a doctor…",0

America is far more willing than Canada to hire foreign engineers . Also the taxes are lower and your starting salary could range from $ 30,000-80,000 per year . In Canada , a very high percentage of your salary will be taxed . Do n't believe the hype about Canada .

"what is the difference between a circumsied & non-circumsied `` male member '' ? one who calls himself `` batman '' is wrong.Circumcision is a surgery that removes foreskin , i.e . a fold of skin that goes around the head of penis in relaxed state . I do not think there is any difference in erect state ( scars maybe ? ) Circumcision makes lots of sence in hot climate with scarce water , as foreskin folds retain some of urine ( no matter how hard you shake it ) , which becomes breeding ground for germs .

"What is going on with me ? I have been struggling to find answers for so long , I cant even think of were to start . If any of this sounds at all familiar please let me know . It all started when I was pregnant with my first child ( about 15 years ago ) when I would eat certain foods I would get heart palpitations , short of breath , weak , headache and nausea ... .it would go away after about 24 hours . When I had my baby the symptms went away . Got pregnant again and they came back is time after I gave birth they did n't go away . Now , 12 years later , after going on the atkins diet , I have realized it is definately related to carbs or sugar , but it seems to build up `` toxins '' before I start getting symptoms which now include the above and edema , boils , acne , yeast infections and bad headaches . Last night I ate a piece of cake and I feel horrible this morning , chest pressure , headache , edema , no appetite , this also happens if I eat too much .

"IF the owner of a home is deceased and you are willed the property , is the property automatically paid for ? Well , if the house still has a mortgage , you will only own the part that is already paid . Say , the house is worth 300k , but there is only 200k left on the mortgage . You will only own the 100k that was already paid for . However , before you jump on it , you will still be liable for everything that comes with the house . All , the liens , pending cases , all taxes , all settlements that are currently being paid , all workers that have worked on the house but have not been paid yet , etc etc . So , after you do the paperworks and assume the position of the new owner , everything related to the house is yours . I dont see a problem , but do consult a lawyer to have him dig up everything on the house . I mean , if its left to you , you will not be liable for anything against the house unless your name is on the deed . Because someone leaves something to you and now you owe because someone is suing the owner of the house for 2 million . How is that fair ?

"Why are Christians so mean ? I 'm watching the news and what do I see ? They are now out picketing at funerals of dead soldiers that `` God hates fags '' . Yep . They are picketing the private mourning of families of solders , straight or gay , whose lives were tragically destroyed.I 'll admit , the whole God thing is a joke anyway , but is n't this just getting out of control ? I wish some crazed lunatic would drive by their picket line and mow them all down while simultaneously blowing their church to the top of Mt . Ararat.And since I 'm sure there will be a barrage of people saying the picketers are on the fringe , I have to say unfortunately they are not . They are all over the place . In our White House and now running the Supreme Court.I dare any one of you to actually read , word for word , the first four books of the Bible and tell me if you find it to be anything short of totally delusional.There are no such things as talking animals or invisible dead people with wings . Fred Phelps and the members of the Westboro Baptist Church *are* a fringe element . Most Christians would *not* picket the funeral of a deceased homosexual , or a deceased soldier who died in Iraq ( yep , Fred Phelps does that too ) . He is a crazy man who just happens to have a few followers , and they are very vocal . However , many bad things in the world have been perpetrated in the name of Christianity , such as the Crusades , slavery , witch hunts , the persecution of homosexuals , lesbians , bisexuals , and transgendered person today . This does not make all Christians `` mean '' or `` bad '' , just like all Russians are not tyrants because of Stalin and all Muslims are not out to destroy America because Al Queda makes attacks in the name of Islam and Allah . Individuals do bad things , groups are not to be defined by those individuals , even if there are a lot of them.Furthermore , the first 4 books of the Bible ( Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , and Numbers ) are not , strictly speaking , Christian compositions . They are the first 4 books of the Jewish Torah , and the Christians `` inherited '' them . This is *not* an attempt to say that `` it 's not Christians who are crazy , it 's the Jews ! `` , but rather a clarification as to the origin of those texts . They certainly *are* Christian texts in that they are used extensively by Christians and form a great deal of basic Christian belief ( the Creation , the Flood , the Abrahamic Promise , etc. ) . The Muslims *also* use these texts as a foundation for Islam , because they also consider themselves to be children of the Abrahamic Promise , descended from Abraham 's elder son , Ishmael . Thus , these books are given credence by three of the world 's major religions , making their `` delusional '' quality somewhat moot because of the sheer number of people who accept those `` delusions '' as true.There are a great many Christians who do try to conduct themselves well , based on their intreptation of what that means . Now , I do n't like their stance on abortion , but it comes from a genuine interest in the rights of the unborn , as people , as opposed to a genuine desire to degrade women to the simple status of breeding stock . Many Christians give charitable donations , such as for the tsunami or Hurricane Katrina , or other disasters . Many Christians go out of their way to be kind to other people . And many of these `` kind '' Christians do n't go about blowing their `` Look at me , I 'm a Christian '' whistle , the way the `` mean '' ones seem to do so often . So , the answer would be that individual Christians are mean for the same reason that individual atheists , individual Muslims , individual police officers , individual cat-kicking children , or individual pizza delivery guys are mean . They just are , and it 's not a reflection on the group at large .",0

"Is there a recursive algorithm that generates all the permutations of a given string ? Here 's a java solution that uses recursion . The permute function takes two arguments : a done portion and a todo portion . The basic idea is that each of the characters in the todo portion could be the next character . So , at each step , n recursive calls are made , where n is the length of todo . Each call chooses a different character as the next character to go into the done portion . So , the first time the number of recursive calls will equal the number of characters in the initial string . Each of these calls will make further recursive calls equal to the number of characters in the initial string minus one . And so on .

"do fish drink water ? Web research seems to indicate that most fish do drink plenty of water , some continuously . Some fish absorb water through their skin and/or gills , and may excrete water that way , too . Apparently , fish need to maintain a fairly high concentration of salt , so how a fish deals with this need depends on whether it is a saltwater or freshwater fish . Most saltwater fish get enough or too much salt , and so preventing water loss is their concern . Freshwater fish are short on salt , and since water dilutes sodium , they have many mechanisms for excreting water . It is interesting to note that kidneys process water for excretion , so some saltwater fish have dysfunctional kidneys or are missing kidneys to help prevent water loss . The four `` water/salt '' strategies are listed below : -- -- -- Admin Note : The problem with fish vs. watery environment has do with the process of osmosis , defined as 'net movement of water molecules through a semipermeable membrane from a dilute solution to a more concentrated solution . The 'membrane ' is the 'skin ' or any other part of the fish that separates it from the water . If the concentration of salts and other solutes in the fish is greater than the outside , watery world , the fish takes on water ( natural attempt to 'dilute the fish to what it 's like outside ' - bad for the fish ) . In scientific terms the fish is hypertonic to its surroundings ( freshwater fish , e.g. ) . If a fish is hypotonic to its environment ( marine fish ) , then the seawater has a higher solute concentration than the fish ; the fish loses water to its surroundings ( also bad for the fish ) . Kidneys function to overcome the effects of osmosis so fishX can stay either more or less concentrated than its environment. -- -- --",0

"MS : what are the drugs , life factors , foods , or whatever that cause MS to speed up and proceed faster ?

Do any drugs make it speed up or flare up ? What is known ? Sun is bad , does it cause it to speed up too ? NCB Seems like they do n't know much about MS . The cause of progression in MS is unknown . A relapse can occur if you become over-heated , overly stressed , overly fatigued ... or it can just happen . No lifestyles that I 'm aware of make a difference in the progression . No foods , either . Supplements that boost your immune system should be avoided , because MS is a disease caused by an `` over active '' immune stem in the first place . Anything that stimulates your immune system could lead to a new attack or an exacerbation . The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people diagnosed with MS begin treating with the `` ABC '' drugs ( Avonex , Betaseron , or Copaxone ) as soon as possible . While they do not `` cure '' MS , they do slow down the progression of the disease and prolong the progression of disability .

"Where can I find an inexpensive but accurate hygrometer ? I want to be able to calibrate it and I need to spend under $ 50 . Nice question , most people unless they are weather buffs or cigar afficianados do n't know about hygrometers.Hygrometers measure relative humidity , or how damp or dry the air is.There are digital and analog hygrometers.Calibration ( adjusting for accuracy ) of both is difficult for various reasons . To calibrate a hygrometer means you need an accurate reference which provides accurate relative humidities over a range of air temperatures and pressures . It is not enough to calibrate a hygrometer at just one point . Most analog ( dial ) hygrometers only allow you to set one point by twiddling the fixed dial until the needle is pointing to the current moisture level.Most inexpensive digital hygrometers do not have calibration controls . The next price level up only allow you to set offset and scale - this is so-called `` linear calibration '' and it is not much better really.Depending on what you are measuring , one of the easiest ways to make your own accurate hygrometer is with two accurate but inexpensive lab thermometers . See the link on how to make a wet bulb hygrometer.Cheap hygrometers are easy to find on auction sites like ebay or yahoo , and using Googles Froogle search .",0

"Is mastarbation harmful for health ? Health and psychological effectsIt is held in many mental health circles that masturbation can relieve depression and lead to a higher sense of self-worth . Masturbation can also be particularly useful in relationships where one partner wants more sex than the other—in which case masturbation provides a balancing effect and thus a more harmonious relationship.Both from the standpoint of avoiding unwanted pregnancy and that of avoiding sexually transmitted diseases , masturbation is the safest of sexual practices . There is no credible scientific or medical evidence that manual masturbation is damaging to either one 's mental or physical health.A man whose penis has suffered `` an invasive procedure , blunt trauma or injury during intercourse '' [ 2 ] may suffer later in life from Peyronie 's disease . Usually in the context of an abnormal tunica albuginea , the rare event of penile fracture [ 3 ] may occur . Phimosis is `` a contracted foreskin ( that ) may cause trouble by hurting when an attempt is made to pull the foreskin back '' [ 4 ] . In each of these cases , overly aggressive manipulation of the penis can be problematic.Contrary to popular myth , masturbation does not cause blindness . There is some basis , however , to the myth : zinc is required both to transport vitamin A from the liver to the retina and is excreted in relatively high amount in semen . Thus , it is not inconceivable that in zinc-deficient or vitamin A-deficient environments excessive male masturbation could have caused night blindness ( in which case sexual intercourse has an equal probability of causing blindness ) . Given a normal contemporary diet , however , this is extremely unlikely to happen . There is also the more modern issue of staring at a computer screen while watching pornography for extended periods of time as the pupils tend to dilate during arousal.The only side-effects recorded are that repeated masturbation may result in tiredness or soreness , which tend to make repeated masturbation self-limiting in any case . For men , the volume of ejaculate is temporarily reduced after multiple ejaculations until normal seminal volume is regained in a day or so . Nevertheless , people may experience feelings of guilt during or after masturbation , especially if they come from a socially conservative or religious background.Solitary masturbation carries no risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases . Masturbation involving both a man and a woman can result in pregnancy only if semen contacts the vulva . Any masturbation with a partner can theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted disease by contact with bodily fluids , and such contact should be avoided with any partner whose disease status is uncertain . Objects inserted into the vagina or anus should be clean and of a kind that will not scratch or break . Care should be taken not to fully insert anything into the anus—any object used should have a flared or flanged base ; otherwise retrieval can require a visit to the emergency room . Most modern dildos and anal plugs are designed with this feature.In 1994 , when the first woman appointed Surgeon General of the United States , Dr. Joycelyn Elders , mentioned as an aside that perhaps it ought to be mentioned in school curricula that masturbation was safe and healthy , she was forced to resign , with opponents asserting that she was promoting the teaching of how to masturbate . Many believe this was the result of her long history of promoting controversial viewpoints and not due solely to her public mention of masturbation . Her case led to the coining of a new and humorous slang term for masturbation : Firing the surgeon general.On July 16 , 2003 , an Australian research team led by Graham Giles of The Cancer Council published a medical study [ 5 ] which concluded that frequent masturbation by males may help prevent the development of prostate cancer . The study also indicated that this would be more helpful than ejaculati",0

"do you know any history on offset printing , who it was invented by and when they invented it ? The first lithographic offset printing press was created in England around 1875 and was designed for printing on metal . The offset cylinder was covered with specially treated cardboard that transferred the printed image from the litho stone to the surface of the metal . About five years later , the cardboard covering of the offset cylinder was changed to rubber , which is still the most commonly used material.The first person to use an offset press to print on paper was probably American Ira Washington Rubel in 1903 . He got the idea accidentally by noticing that whenever a sheet of paper was not fed into his lithographic press during operation , the stone printed its image to the rubber-covered impression cylinder , and the next impression had an image on both sides : direct litho on the front and an image from the rubber blanket on the back . Rubel then noticed that the image on the back of the sheet was much sharper and clearer than the direct litho image because the soft rubber was able to press the image onto the paper better than the hard stone . He soon decided to build a press which printed every image from the plate to the blanket and then to the paper . Brothers Charles and Albert Harris independently observed this process at about the same time and developed an offset press for the Harris Automatic Press Company soon after .",0

I realize he should made sure the ticket was taken care of.His daughter is involved in lots of activities on weekends , but I have things I want to do also , and do n't think its fair to spend the next 12 weekends on call to drive them around . The girl 's mother is kind of uninterested in her and goes out partying every weekend.We get her every other weekend , the mom goes out regardless . Am I being unreasonable ? You need to decide if your in this relationship for the long haul . If you are then his kid is a major part of his life and should be in yours . While I know you ca n't be on call all the time you can help him make arrangements for getting around . He is also going to have to adjust his life for a few months and realize that there may be times when he simply ca n't be some where . However , he should always be there for his kid and if your committed to this relationship so should you .",0
"How do you start looking for Venture Capital Funding ? For an online company , located in a small rural area , that has been in business for over 5 years , how does one go about attracting venture capital funds and investors ? Venture Capital is just another name for private investor . There are some private investor groups but they are not well advertised . Typically a venture capitalist does not engage in the business of private investing because there is usually no or very little return on the investment . They expect to get their money back at best . That 's why it is hard to find them , it 's not a business . However , there are some organizations that provide business resources , councilling , consulting , advice , and these are usually staffed by successful business people . The chamber of commerce in your city and the state will provide you with local information . Often , those groups will point you in the right direction for fund raising . Another resource is to join a country club and/or a golf club where business executives tend to favor . Networking is key to many aspects of business success . To get your online business producing sales revenues you can hire a professional online marketing company and put me to work making you money .

"Space Cadets - hoax on us ? I 've heard in various places that the Space Cadets reality TV show on Channel 4 in the UK is actually performed entirely by actors , notably on Radio 1 yesterday morning.The show openly admits there are some actors there , but I find it hard to believe that none of them are genuine . The premise of the show is a group of people are told they are being sent to space , and placed in an incredibly realistic simulator for 5 days . The claims against it state the whole programme is a trick on the viewing public ... any ideas guys ? Find out more about the show at http : //www.Channel4.co.uk/SpaceCadets There was an article by one of the programme producers in The Guardian recently , which included his admission that they planted some people , but also explained the selection criteria for the victims.You could argue the article itself could be part of the hoax on us , but I think a national newspaper would be careful to avoid getting egg on their faces by being sucked into it like that , particularly given the controversy about the programme . In addition , the tone of the article was too convincing to my mind - the sense of the producer 's pride in pulling it off , amusement and mischief rang true .",0

Everyone sold those products on anonymous web sites and with high costs ! That ’ s just should be an alarm bell… eh ?

"does anyone think that literature effects everyone 's everyday life ? I 'm sure many including myself will agree on the fact that literature affects one 's life immensely . Good literature is not only a good sense of entertainment but also refines one 's vocabulary and personality . They even add to knowledge as well as affect the views of a person . A person who is a fanatic of Sherlock Holmes will learn to analyse things deeply and will develop skills of perception and systematic thinking.Many people also picture themselves as one of the characters . It helps them to overcome troubles by being inspired . A good background in literature helps you learn how thinks were in the past , analyse the present and then shape the future . There is a lot to learn fom Literature and believe me it is worth the time to read some Book .",0

"If the core of a nuclear plant went critical ( china syndrome ) would it actually melt it 's way to china ? This is prob a stupid question , I just saw the movie and I missed the explanation of the result of a china syndrome . All nuclear plants that are producing power must be `` critical . '' The plant is shut down when it is `` subcritical . '' A nuclear accident can occur if the reactor goes `` supercritical . '' A supercritical plant can release uncontrolled heat drying the core and melting it . A melted core would fall by gravity toward the center of the world ( like anything else that falls ) . Since Canton OH was almost directly opposite Canton China on the globe , the core would fall toward China , thus the China syndrome . Of course the core would have to melt its way past the plant barriers but would not release enough energy to reach China let alone deeply penetrate the earth . For those with a wild imagination , China would also be protected by the massive molten layer in the center of the earth that surrounds the extremely hard metal core . None-the-less , China Syndrome is a catchy phrase .",0

"What is the church of scientology ? Literally , Scientology means the study of truth . Scientologists believe that man is an immortal spiritual being whose experiences extend far beyond just this lifetime . According to Scientology , man 's capabilities are unlimited , even if they are not presently realized.Scientologists believe that painful memories from our past can hinder our ability to realize our limitless potential . For this , Scientologists offer auditing which enables people to remove the painful effects of these bad memories . Practically , auditing is a type of counseling using a lie detetector called an E-meter . In auditing , the auditor never invalidates what the pre-clear says . The ultimate aim of auditing is so people can attain the state of `` Clear , '' or a state of freedom from painful past memories . Clears are free from psychosomoatic illnesses , self determined , vigorous and persistent.Scientology 's aims are a civilization without insanity , without criminals and without wars . Where the able can prosper , where honest beings can have rights and where man is free to rise to greater heights.For this purpose , Scientologists run many humanitarian organizations including Narconon and Criminon , helping people get off drugs , the Citizens Commission on Human Rights , which fights psychiatric abuse , the Applied Scholastics educational system and the Way to Happiness Foundation .",0

"IS the freezing of water exothermic ? The guy above me does n't know what he 's talking about . He 's confused . Think about it : to freeze water , you need to take energy away from the water , right ? ( You lower the temperature , which is the same thing as taking energy away . Imagine sucking energy away from water to make it freeze . ) So , by definition , freezing water is exothermic . It gives off energy . Conversely , the melting of water is endothermic ; you need to give ice energy in order for it to melt . I know it can get confusing because when you touch ice , it 's cold , so you might think that freezing is endothermic , but it 's not . If you think about it , ice in your hand is taking away energy from your hand in order for it to melt ( that 's why it feels cold ) , so melting is endothermic , making freezing exothermic .",0

"Which is the fastest computer in the world ? Well , there are three perspectives to your question , which are as follows : ( 1 ) A super computer ( 2 ) A desktop computer ( 3 ) Anything in a general sense that can compute.For the third perspective , The fastest computer in the world is much faster than the desktop in front of you , and it is sitting right on top of your shoulders ! The human brain is an amazing computing device and the fastest processor available right now . In supercomputers , the BlueGene/L - eServer Blue Gene Solution stationed at DOE/NNSA/LLNL at Livermore in California is ruling the world . It has , hold on your breath , 131072 processors , each processor with an individual performance of 2.8 GigaFlops ( PowerPC 440 700 MHz ) . It has a main memory of 32768 GB and is 3 times more powerful in processing than its immediate competitor ( Also by IBM ) . Surprisingly , its still in expansion phase . Blue Gene is an IBM Research project dedicated to exploring the frontiers in supercomputing : in computer architecture , in the software required to program and control massively parallel systems , and in the use of computation to advance our understanding of important biological processes such as protein folding.As for the fastest desktop configuration , it keeps changing every now and then . An interesting fact to note , Intel had come up with 4GHz chip , but could not commercialize it because of the excessive heating which could damage the chip . Hope to see such a chip soon .

While a member of the U.S. House Committee on Naval Affairs , Vandiver attended an 1899 naval banquet in Philadelphia .

"What is a less toxic alternative to Chemo therapy for breast cancer treatment in a woman ? To be honest , chemotherapy is not a cancer treatment . Here is the situation . Chemo can take care of the problem right away , but the doctor always says that , some can live an extended 2 years , or 3 years . And some die right away from the chemicals . This is with late stages of cancer . Now , for early stages , it helps the problem but your health is deteriorated . They say that chemo affects the cancer and your normal body cells . How many people you know , who have had late stages of cancer , and lived through it pass 5 yours with chemo therapy ? I bet you that you have never even heard of it . Even if someone has , how many people is that compared to that masses ? The problem with other medicines is that the pharmaceautical companies can not control that product . What if it was tree bark say for instance . How many people do you know will buy the pills if they can just walk up to any tree and bite a piece off to save themselves ? See ? So , USA doctors are familiar with these remedies , but they do not talk about it . Try asking your doctor about green algae , or cesium chloride , or paw paw , etc etc . Then they start to talk . Otherwise , they wont say a word . And if you dont know , how can you ask ? So , the doctors lips are sealed tight . The individual doctors on the other hand are sometimes scared to talk about it . It is because , if they open their mouths , they would be facing the whole medical community . Alot of them go into the medical field to help people , and some go in it for money . But , the top ranking ones in control are all in it for money . If not , they would have never gotten their position . I do not suggest you go with chemo therapy . You can look up some alternative medicine to cancer and they are all over the place on the net . The best ranked one is cesium chloride , paw paw , and along with others . Some health websites even have a place where you can go and tell them your stage of cancer and which type of cancer , and they will sell you a package based on your individual problem . There are also some doctors scattered all over the USA who specialize in cancer . You never hear about them right ? Well , they wont be bothered by the medical community if they do a small operation without much advertising . But , they all report about 90 % survival rates on cancers that regular cancer doctors give up on . And if that doctor didnt give up , do you expect to live anyways ? No . I speak out to you because I dont want you to die like the two of my friends who have already died . Certain doctors even said that they could cure it with 80 % survival rate . But , I didnt have the money to help them . So , I am speaking out in hopes that nothing happens to you and you survive . Regardless of your stage of cancer . Cesium chloride is what works best . Look it up , its everywhere . Even oxygen drops help . You can use them both at the same time . The thing is with these alternatives is that , some of them make you feel extremely bad at the beginning , but after a while you get used to it , and then you are gone with the cancer before you know it . So dont feel discouraged . Oxygen drops keep cancer from growing because your body can live with more oxygen . As a matter of fact , it helps circulate your blood . Cancer can not live at the sight of oxygen . It has been said that not enough oxygen is what causes cancer . I dont know what the cause is , because there are many causes . But , cesium chloride and oxygen drops will take care of it . And one more thing , some of these remedies can not be sold as a cancer treatment . So , they are sold as vitamins . But , in their website , they are allowed to say what it cures . But , their labels can not say a word about cancer . So , you should start in the vitamin section of the internet . Good luck my friend .",0

"Why ca n't a praying mantis be enlarged 80 times its size and survive ? A giant mantis has two reasons not to survive.To sum the consequenses up , a giant prayer mantis has difficulty taking in oxygen ; can not fly ; and will collapse.The first , the oxygen thing . Just as the previous answer indicates , insects intake oxygen via diffusion.Picture a room with perfect still air , like a cellar . Suppose you put an open bottle of perfume at one end of the room . Some time later , you can smell the perfume at the other end of the room . There 's no air current in the room to bring the fragrant to you . It 's the perfume molecules , they wander around randomly . Some of them find their way into your nostrils so you can smell them . You will be able to smell the perfume sooner in a smaller room because the molecules have to wander through a shorter distance.The blood of insects does not carry oxygen , they have a series of air-filled tubes ( called trachea , plural tracheae ) all over their body , opening to some 'port-holes ' ( called spiracles ) along their abdomen . Most of insects are so small that the oxygen molecules , once entered the spiracles ( port-holes ) , do n't have long to wander along the tubes before reaching their destination -- the organs where they are consumed . Now , suppose the same insect is enlarged 80 times its length . The airway is also enlonged 80 times . It would take a LOT more time for oxygen to wander along this super long tube . During that time , the organs would have consumed all the oxygen around them without new oxygen coming in . So they die , and the insect dying with them.However this is only the case for small insects . Larger insects actually have air-bags withing their body to make a breeze along their tracheae ( air tubes ) to bring in oxygen . Quoting from the sourse page , `` Larger insects , such as grasshoppers and wasps , have internal air sacs connected to their tracheae . These insects speed up their gas exchange by squeezing the sacs to make them suck air in from outside . '' I 've no idea whether a prayer mantis has air sacs or not , but I 've seen one bigger than any grasshoppers or wasps I ever saw . Nevertheless , a giant prayer mantis would need much more powerful air sacs than the grasshoppers'.Now come to the second reason . Size . We will look at the two consequences of a super-huge size seperately.Think of a car on a highway . It can drive over 100 feet in a matter of seconds -- let 's say 2 seconds , so it 's speed is 50 feet per second . Now the car shrinks to the size of a prayer mantis . In the same 2 seconds , how far can it drive now ? 1 feet , more or less , so it 's speed is 0.5 feet per second . We see that the mini car is much slower . But the driver , who shrank with the car , he thinks he 's driving as fast ! Now think of the mantis , and think of a helicopter . The mantis flies much slower than the helicopter , just like the mini car is slower than the real car . And we have it that the faster things move through the air , the more resistance they experience . The helicopter flies fast , so its shape must be streamlined , as to reduce air resistance . The prayer mantis flies slow , so he does n't care much about air resistance , he can have any cool shape he desires . But for a giant mantis ? He would move much faster , and experience so much air resistance that with his cool shape ( not much streamlined ) he wo n't be able to fly at all.Let 's face the second consequence . Has anyone ever made a jelly block 5 feet long , 5 feet wide and 5 feet high ? What will happen if such a giant jelly is constructed ? It would collapse right away and flow like water . But any half-inch long , half-inch wide , half-inch high jelly block would stay all right in one 's spoon . What happens when the jelly grows in size ? For each bit of jelly in the bottom , there 's simply much more jelly on top of it ! And when that bit of jelly can no longer bear the burden , it breaks itself and flow away so that it wo n't have to support any more . So th",0

Annual Glaucoma testing is recommended for everyone over 60 years old . Individuals with a family history of glaucoma , African Americans and the elderly are considered at elevated risk of glaucoma and should be tested on a yearly basis . Fortunately , glaucoma can now be treated with a remarkable laser technology that can halt the disease ’ s progress .

"Legal action against online forum members ? A few years ago , I belonged to a lively forum . I was only one of about five people who did not care for a certain action among most of the forum members , which numbered in the hundreds . Soon , we opposers were attacked one by one , and driven out of the forum . I contacted the forum editor and discussed the posting rules with him . It turns out he was unwilling to do anything about this , so I resigned from the forum of my own free will . Since that time , I 've been maligned repeatedly , mainly by one person , and have discovered his posts giving out my personal details , including my description , telling people to beat me up if they saw me in public ! I never corresponded with this person outside the forum , nor within it . I 've lost touch with the few posters I called friends . Do I have any legal recourse ? The editor of the forum simply tells this person to knock it off for a short while , and he starts over again . Two years is more than enough time for this to be ended ! Mature , this guy is n't !

"who are muslims ? A Muslim is a believer in or follower of Islam . The word Muslim means one who submits and implies complete submission to the will of God ( Allah ) . Muslims believe that nature is itself Islamic , since it follows natural laws placed by God . Thus , a Muslim strives to surrender to God 's commands every step of the way.Until recently the word was also spelled Moslem . Muslims do not recommend this spelling because it is often pronounced `` mawzlem , '' which sounds like an Arabic word for `` oppressor . '' Many English-language writers used to call Muslims `` Mohammedans '' or `` Mahometans '' , meaning `` followers of Mohammed '' , but this terminology is considered incorrect and insulting , because Muslims believe it implies that they worship the prophet Muhammad , contrary to the fundamental principles of Islam itself.Sources of IslamSunni sources of IslamThe Holy Quran Ahadith ( singular Hadith ) - recordings of the life of the Prophet Muhammad , reported by any one of his companions .

"What are the best studio monitor speakers for under $ 500 ? I assume here that you are asking about nearfield active monitors , and that you are aiming for sub- $ 500 for the pair ( not each ) . There are a few factors which play into the decision , including ( a ) the type of music you will be working with , ( b ) your workstation setup , and ( c ) the room.The type of music can determine whether or not you need a subwoofer . If you do , that 's an additional component which you will need to factor into your overall budget.The workstation setup will play into the positioning and power of the speakers . How much space do you have ? Where will the speakers go , and will they be near any walls or corners ? How will they be positioned relative to your head ? ( assuming nearfield ) The room can play a bit into the monitor decision , but it 's probably a bit more of a factor in tuning your setup once you have your monitors . Look into room acoustics as you 're making your monitor decision to understand what your overall monitoring/room setup will entail.Having thought a bit about the above , the key thing for monitors is to have something sufficiently detailed and revealing to make accurate mixes . Ideally , it wo n't be too fatiguing , as you will most likely be listening to them for extended periods of time . On top of that , it 's mostly a matter of getting accustomed to them so you can make accurate mixing decisions . The net of all of this is that monitor choices are fairly personal . Keep in mind that the goal is to get something accurate which will allow you to hear everything you need to hear , which is NOT the same as `` sounding good '' . Take some CDs and audition your top candidates against music you know well , focusing on key portions that highlight particular ranges or potential problem areas ( extended low bass , detailed highs , stereo imaging , etc . ) It can help to take some of your own mixes , if possible.Some specific inexpensive monitors I 've heard good things about are the KRK Rokits and the lower-end Events . Again , the key is to be familiar with the speakers so you can make accurate mixes .",0

However , it 's generally a good idea not to sleep with a bra on because it can interfere with good circulation and easy breathing.If you 're putting in overtime with your bra to preserve perkiness , that 's a total myth . Bras do n't preserve the shape or perkiness of breasts . Sagging results from a number of factors unrelated to bra wearing , such as* breast fat and tissue composition* softening of breast ligaments and loss of breast tissue with age* enlarged breasts during pregnancy , which causes the skin to stretch even after they revert to pre-pregnancy size .",0

"sprained ankle ? I sprained my ankle training for a marathon during the summer & it still hurts to run . How come it 's taking so long to heal & are there any exercises I can do to help it along faster ? If an ankle sprain does not heal correctly , the joint may become unstable , resulting in a weakened and easily reinjured ankle . Proper initial care of your sprained ankle is critical . A compression wrap helps decrease swelling . If swelling is kept to a minimum , you will heal faster and get back on your feet sooner . Applying a compression wrap is easy and can be done at home . Elastic bandages are inexpensive and available at most drugstores . A protective brace can be worn over a compression wrap if you try to bear weight on your injured ankle . A compression wrap , such as an elastic ACE bandage , can hold the ankle in place and protect it from further injury . It also helps decrease swelling . A compression wrap should be worn for the first 24 to 36 hours.Also , try soaking it in hot water and epsom salts . I sprained both of mine playing football .",0

"Why is the ocean blue ? It might sound like i 'm joking.. But i really need to know . Is it because it 's reflecting off the sky ? Water is faint blue . Although water appears clear in small quanities ( like a glass of water ) , the blue color becomes visible the more water we look through . Thus , deep lakes and seas are bluer than a shallow river.Other factors can affect the color we see : 1 . Particles and solutes can absorb light , as in tea or coffee . Green algae in rivers and streams often lend a blue-green color . The red sea has occasional blooms of red Trichodesmium erythraeum algae . 2 . Particles in water can scatter light . The Colorado river is often muddy red because of suspended reddish silt in the water . Some mountain lakes and streams with finely gound rock , such as glacial flour , are tourquise . Light scattering by suspended matter is required in order that the blue light produced by water 's absorption can return to the surface and be observed . Such scattering can also shift the spectrum of the emerging photons toward the green , a color often seen when water laden with suspended particles is observed . 3 . The surface of seas and lakes often reflect blue skylight , making them appear bluer . [ [ [ Montana reflection . ] ] ] The relative contribution of reflected skylight and the light scattered back from the depths is strongly dependent on observation angle .",0

However approx 30 minutes after your session is over your body will begin to go after your muscles for energy rather than your fat cell or carbs and you will be in effect working against your goal .

"HOw do El Ninos warm water 's affect the weather. ? needs to be at least 80 words long okay , now that enough time has gone by to keep you from just copying this onto your homework : ( at least that 's what I read in when you say ..needs to be 80 words.. ) I quote : '' Because El Niño 's warm pool feeds thunderstorms above , it creates increased rainfall across the east-central and eastern Pacific Ocean.In South America , the effects of El Niño are direct and stronger than in North America . An El Niño is associated with warm and very wet summers ( December-February ) along the coasts of northern Peru and Ecuador , causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme . The effects during the months of February , March and April may become critical . Southern Brazil and northern Argentina also experience wetter than normal conditions but mainly during the spring and early summer . Central Chile receives a mild winter with large rainfall , and the Peruvian-Bolivian Altiplano is sometimes exposed to unusual winter snowfall events . Drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the Amazon River Basin , Colombia and Central America.Direct effects of El Niño resulting in drier conditions occur in Indonesia , increasing forest fires , in the Philippines , and northern Australia . Drier than normal conditions are also generally observed in Queensland , inland Victoria , inland New South Wales and eastern Tasmania during June-August.West of the Antarctic Peninsula , the Ross , Bellingshausen , and Amundsen Sea sectors have more sea ice during El Niño . The latter two and the Weddell Sea also become warmer and have higher atmospheric pressure.In North America , typically , winters are warmer than normal in the upper Midwest states and Canada , while central and southern California , northwest Mexico and the southeastern U.S. , are wetter than normal . Summer is wetter in the intermountain regions of the U.S . The Pacific Northwest states , on the other hand , tend to be drier during an El Niño . During a La Niña , by contrast , the Midwestern U.S. tends to be drier than normal . El Niño is also associated with decreased hurricane activity in the Atlantic.Finally , East Africa , including Kenya , Tanzania and the White Nile basin , experiences in the long rains from March to May wetter than normal conditions . There also are drier than normal conditions from December to February in south-central Africa , mainly in Zambia , Zimbabwe , Mozambique and Botswana '' source : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_nino",0

"what is biotechnology and how it is used ? Biotechnology covers a wide range of uses , but I 'd say that mostly it 's about manipulating cells to express genes that we want them to express . This could be to make them produce industrial enzymes , designer agriculture , or biopharmaceuticals . the genetic code is pretty much universal , meaning we can take a gene from one organiand put into another to acheive specific results . Industrial enzymes can be used for anything from cleaning wastewater with special enzymes to degrade certain toxins , to making enzymes that breakdown starch into sugar for the production of ethanol for fuel , to the making of specific detergents . With agriculture , we can transfect plants with genes that make them more resistant to diseases or vermin , or more robust and able to grow under more varied claimates , or we can make food bigger or more nutritious . In biopharmceuticals , we address genetic disorders by creating the proteins that some people are unable to make for themselves , allowing them to lead more normal lives .",0

That is to say , each child from either couple would be equally well-related to their brothers and sisters as they were to their cousins.There would be only standard risks of problems with the children and this would NOT have any problems associated with incest that other users appear to believe it would .",0

"Wht are the reqs for becoming a licensed psychiatrist in Florida ? Do you need a PhD or do you just need certification ? I 've just started looking into this as a career option & am sort of lost as to what to do or where to go for some complete answers . My intent , if at all possible , is to attend an online college , such as Capella . Thanks for the help ! In order to be a psychiatrist you need to attend an tradtional college/university and earn a BA or BS . Then you need to make sure that you have the required prerequisite classes for medical school which is inorganic chemistry I and II , organic chemistry I and II , physics I and II , biology I and II , 6-9 gredit hours of english/ english lit.. And some schools require that an applicant has calculus and 3-9 hours of behavioral sciences . And do n't forget to take the MCAT , have good recommendations , maybe volunteer at a hospital etc.. Then apply to medical school in which you will earn either a MD or DO depending on what program you want to be in . ( A psychiatrist has earned either an MD or DO . ) After you graduate from medical school , you need to enter a psychiatry residency ( I do n't know how long the residency program lasts , maybe 2-3 years ? ) . But , if you want to be a psychologist , you still need a BA or BS and then go to gradtuate school for psychology and earn a PhD . Be careful not to confuse a psychiatrist with a psychologist . A psychiatrist is a medical doctor ( M.D . or D.O . ) who writes out prescriptions and decides whether physical and mental disorders are from physical or psychological origins . A psychologist , however , is a doctor of philosophy ( Ph.D ) or a doctor of psychology ( Psy.D ) . Those are not medical degrees , and a psychologist can not prescribe medicine . But in order to become either one , you need to earn a B.A or B.S . first and have very good grades .",0

"What is the preferred treatment for a large hematoma on the shin caused by trauma ? The area on the shin is large ( 3 inches by 2 inches ) and very swollen and has n't changed for 3 months . Doctor says it may take 6 months to `` go down '' and that , if not , it may need to be `` drained '' . The doctors are right . I developed one on my shin after a wreck . 6 months later it was flat and only minorly discolored , 8 months later it was no longer painful to the touch and the coloration had gone , 10 months later it no longer hurt to run . It does take a while , I would wait as long as you can to decide to get it drained , because I was told this can be painful . But if there 's absolutely no change in color or size after 7 months , you may want to go for it , cause that 's about when the calcification process starts ( Eventually it will turn hard . ) Healing time also depends on where the hematoma is located . If there is mostly bone and not alot of muscle mass , it may not take as long ( i.e . top of foot , hand , etc . ) In areas with much muscle mass and fat , it may take a long time , because the muscle absorbs all the protein.Here 's what you can do to hurry it a little : Fill a styrofoam cup with water and freeze.Tear the top rim off so a half inch or so protrudes like chapstick.Massage the hematoma lightly with this ice for 15 minutes at a time , 3 to 4 times daily.At night , use some form of localized heat , that can be comfortable and not dangerous or painfull . This will help promote bloodflow in that area.DO N'T rub or massage the area , you may make the area bleed again under the skin , starting you back at day 1.Eat a diet rich in protein.Get extra rest if the hematoma is on your legs or feet.Good luck , I hope this helps you .",0

She needs to be able to come to the conclusion on her own that she made a mistake , and that this other guy is not the one for her it simply is not something you can coerce her into . If you try , you will do nothing more than to drive a larger wedge into your already shattered relationship . Give her space and time to miss you , and if she does n't then you have your answer but she ca n't miss you if you continue to cling to her.Also , I think something that you might need to consider as well is would you ever be able to move past her betrayal of you trust ? After all she did start another relationship before ending the one with you first . One other thing to consider is that perhaps your lives are just taking two different paths at the moment . Maybe she felt that she wanted someone more inline with her own personal goals and aspirations .",0

Can someone tell me when Google Earth update the Images ? Images on of my City Chandigarh are Six months old . Google gets its imagery from several different sources . It is my understanding that they buy the imagery from private companies such as DigitalGlobe and EarthSat/MDA .

Rather they just take the imagery that these company 's other clients have already requested and had tasked . As such Google rolls new imagery as it becomes more easily available from the companies .

There is too much movie out there that depict this phenom , is n't it ? So how we can sure that this is not possible to be legal in the future ? Hi there , You are absolutely right . It is likely that Human Cloning will be accepted in the future . Just think of it ... Would n't it be wonderful to clone persons like Einstein , Socrates , and other great people who have influenced this world ? But I think there must be restrictions on whom to clone . If not , the population of this world will rise rapidly . Also , it will give rise to unnecessary chaos and disorder regarding who is who . And I also think the technology should be known to a limited number of scientists , because there is a likely chance of illegal cloning ( as in the movie 'The Sixth Day ' ) If every person gets to know the technology , he can take the creation into his own hands , and so all the unethical things are likely to happen .

"Why is the sky blue ? Light is a kind of energy that can travel through space . Light from the sun or a light bulb looks white , but it is really a mixture of many colors . The colors in white light are red , orange , yellow , green , blue and violet . You can see these colors when you look at a rainbow in the sky.Rainbow PictureThe sky is filled with air . Air is a mixture of tiny gas molecules and small bits of solid stuff , like dust.As sunlight goes through the air , it bumps into the molecules and dust . When light hits a gas molecule , it may bounce off in a different direction . Some colors of light , like red and orange , pass straight through the air . But most of the blue light bounces off in all directions . In this way , the blue light gets scattered all around the sky.When you look up , some of this blue light reaches your eyes from all over the sky . Since you see blue light from everywhere overhead , the sky looks blue .",0

"give 1safety precaution should be taken when celestine is heated with carbon in a lab and reason ? Celestine is sometimes used to produce a red color in fireworks .

Charcoal from soft woods , such as grape vine or willow , is good for fast-burning compositions like black powder , whereas charcoal from hard woods like pine are used to create long-lasting spark effects . In any laboratory setting proper personal protection equipment should be employed . I recommend using safety glasses , a laboratory coat , full length pants and latex/polyethylene gloves . You should n't wear open toed shoes and loose articles of clothing that could snag . In cases were an explosion is possible , proper shielding is required .

"why there is 28 days on Feburary ? February is the second month of the year in the Gregorian Calendar . It is the shortest Gregorian month and the only month with the length of 28 or 29 days . The month has 29 days in leap years , when the year number is divisible by four ( except for years that are divisible by 100 and not by 400 ) . In other years the month has 28 days.February begins , astronomically speaking , with the sun in the constellation of Capricornus and ends with the sun in the constellation of Aquarius . Astrologically speaking , February begins with the sun in the sign of Aquarius and ends in the sign of Pisces.February was named for the Roman god Februus , the god of purification . January and February were the last two months to be added to the Roman calendar , since the Romans originally considered winter a monthless period . This change was made by Numa Pompilius about 700 BC in order to bring the calendar in line with a standard lunar year . Numa 's Februarius contained 29 days ( 30 in a leap year ) . Augustus is alleged to have removed one day from February and added it to August , ( renamed from Sextilis to honor himself ) , so that Julius Caesar 's July would not contain more days . However there is little historical evidence to support this claim.February was nominally the last month of the Roman calendar , as the year originally began in March . At certain intervals Roman priests inserted an intercalary month , Mercedonius , after February to realign the year with the seasons.Historical names for February include the Anglo-Saxon terms Solmoneth ( mud month ) and Kale-monath ( named for cabbage ) as well as Charlemagne 's designation Hornung . In old Japanese calendar , the month is called Kisaragi ( 如月 , 絹更月 or 衣更月 ) . It is sometimes also called Mumetsuki ( 梅見月 ) or Konometsuki ( 木目月 ) . In Finnish , the month is called helmikuu , meaning `` month of the pearl '' .February is recognized as Black History Month in the United States and Canada . `` February '' is pronounced without the first r , as `` Febuary '' , by many speakers . This is probably elision , or an analogical change influenced by `` January '' .",0

That 's why it is important to support your immune system . Seasonal Defense combines andrographis with other immune-supporting herbs , including Fructus aurantia ( six percent synephrine extract ) , thyme , oregano and eleuthero root for complete immune support.Andrographis has been used for centuries by many cultures . It is used widely in Ayurvedic medicine and is considered a “ cold property ” herb in traditional Chinese approaches ; it is used to rid the body of “ heat ” and dispel toxins . Andrographis supports the immune system by promoting both specific and non-specific immune-response functions as well as maintaining the muscles in the respiratory system . Other studies show that synephrine may be able to help maintain the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract and that thyme and eleuthero root both have beneficial properties. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Benefits : • Helps the body defend against seasonal changes . • Contains andrographis to help boost the immune system . • Helps support mucous membrane health .

"what is the order of the magnitude of the power of a light source so that the photons can knock me over ? To Skully : I often jump too quickly to answer a question , but it 's a bad habit . Solar sails and radiometers : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sailhttp : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes_radiometerIn fact , light is responsible for the motion of all electrons.As for the original question , I 'm going to assume that you 're a two meter long ( rather tall , actually ) 65 kilogram plank . Your center of gravity would have to be displaced about .25 meters ( off your feet ) to tip you over . Gravity exerts a maximum torque of about 80 N*m on you . At the top of your head , that torque produces 40 newtons . When it 's reflected , light exerts a `` pressure '' of 2*I/c where I is the intensity of light ( in watts per meter^2 ) . Multiplying both sides by area and plugging this into my calculator produces about 6 billion watts ( and remember , that 's if you wear a reflective surface on your head and it 's only enough to tip you over , not actually knock you down ) .

"where did Billie Holiday go to school ? Sounds like school was a big part of her life , if any.Born Eleanora Fagan , she had a difficult childhood which affected her life and career . Much of Holiday 's childhood is clouded by conjecture and legend , some of it propagated by herself in her autobiography published in 1956 . She was born in Philadelphia but grew up in the Fells Point section of Baltimore . According to her autobiography , her house was the first on their street to have electricity . Her mother , Sadie Fagan , was just thirteen at the time of her birth ; her father Clarence Holiday , a jazz guitarist who would play for Fletcher Henderson , was fifteen . Billie Holiday 's parents married when she was three , but they soon divorced , leaving her to be raised largely by her mother and other relatives . A hardened and angry child , she dropped out of school at an early age and , allegedly , began working as a prostitute with her mother . This preceded her move to New York with her mother sometime in the early 1930s.There is controversy regarding Holiday 's paternity . This stems from a copy of her birth certificate in Baltimore archives that lists the father as a `` Frank DeViese '' . Some historians consider this an anomaly , probably inserted by a hospital or government worker ( See Donald Clarke , Billie Holiday : Wishing on the Moon , ISBN 0306811367 ) . Clarence Holiday accepted paternity , but was hardly a responsible father . In the rare times Billie did see him , she would shake him down for money by threatening to tell his then-girlfriend that Holiday was his daughter .",0

Or how about you stand on some scales , take a picture of the display , scan it into a computer , then clone the display area so that you have a scale with 2 displays . So , if you are 120lbs there will be one display saying 120lbs and another display next to it saying 120lbs .

"how to cure a bruise around the soft tissue of ankle ? If it is already visibly bruised , it is too late for ice . Ice slows the circulation to the area to limit blood leakage from capillaries damaged during the injury . To Remove the dead blood cells and other debris that is causing the discoloration you need to apply heat to increase circulation into the area . A hot pad , on thirty minutes , off for thirty minutes . Do n't burn the area . It will also go away by itself . BTW , bruises do n't hurt , the damaged tissue from which the blood leaked is what hurts . If it is still tender , it is not yet healed .",0

This will slowly start to replenish you , though if you drank a lot , you 'll need more.Be sure to drink a lot of water throughout the day and eat some bread ( which will absorb some of the alcohol ) .

"Anyone give me a definitive answer about the origins of the term `` o.k. '' ? thanks ? The letters , not to keep you guessing , stand for `` oll korrect . '' They 're the result of a fad for comical abbreviations that flourished in the late 1830s and 1840s . Read buttressed his arguments with hundreds of citations from newspapers and other documents of the period . As far as I know his work has never been successfully challenged.The abbreviation fad began in Boston in the summer of 1838 and spread to New York and New Orleans in 1839 . The Boston newspapers began referring satirically to the local swells as OFM , `` our first men , '' and used expressions like NG , `` no go , '' GT , `` gone to Texas , '' and SP , `` small potatoes . '' Many of the abbreviated expressions were exaggerated misspellings , a stock in trade of the humorists of the day . One predecessor of OK was OW , `` oll wright , '' and there was also KY , `` know yuse , '' KG , `` know go , '' and NS , `` nuff said . `` Most of these acronyms enjoyed only a brief popularity . But OK was an exception , no doubt because it came in so handy . It first found its way into print in Boston in March of 1839 and soon became widespread among the hipper element . It did n't really enter the language at large , however , until 1840 . That 's when Democratic supporters of Martin Van Buren adopted it as the name of their political club , giving OK a double meaning . ( `` Old Kinderhook '' was a native of Kinderhook , New York . ) OK became the warcry of Tammany hooligans in New York while beating up their opponents . It was mentioned in newspaper stories around the country.Van Buren 's opponents tried to turn the phrase against him , saying that it had originated with Van Buren 's allegedly illiterate predecessor , Andrew Jackson , a story that has survived to this day . They also devoted considerable energy to coming up with unflattering interpretations , e.g. , `` Out of Kash , Out of Kredit , and Out of Klothes . '' Newspaper editors and publicists around the country delighted in coming up with even sillier interpretations -- Oll Killed , Orfully Konfused , Often Kontradicts , etc. -- so that by the time the campaign was over the expression had taken firm root nationwide .",0

"Why the pornography or pictures of genitals are forbidden on TV , but the scenes of blood and brutality are not Do n't get me wrong ! I do n't mean that pornography should be allowed , but I just wonder what are the criteria for forbidding the first but allowing the second . Is n't it hypocrisy ? Here in the USA , we have based our sociatal rights and wrongs on a christianic/judiac system of morals . In that , anything of a sexual nature is wrong , whereas things of violence can pertain to you following the precepts of your faith . whether its being ready to die for your beliefs or more likely , to kill for them . In the eastern/asian systems , violence is wrong , and things of a sexual nature are much more highly tolerated . Take japan , you can very easily have nudity in a pg , but much of any violence raises it to an R. its also historicaly bases as well . As americans we have not had any personal access to real violence . whereas in japan they literaly had war on their mainland within the last generation . memories of things like that can last .",0

"What are some symptoms to Manic Depression ? Bipolar Disorder ( Manic Depression ) Another type of depression is bipolar disorder , which was formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression . This condition shows a particular pattern of inheritance . Not nearly as common as the other types of depressive disorders , bipolar disorder involves cycles of depression and mania , or elation . Bipolar disorder is often a chronic , recurring condition . Sometimes , the mood switches are dramatic and rapid , but most often they are gradual.When in the depressed cycle , the person can experience any or all of the symptoms of a depressive disorder . When in the manic cycle , any or all of the symptoms listed under mania may be experienced . Mania often affects thinking , judgment , and social behavior in ways that cause serious problems and embarrassment . For example , unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is in a manic phase.A significant variant of bipolar disorder is designated as bipolar II . ( The usual form of bipolar disorder is referred to as bipolar I . ) Bipolar II is a syndrome in which the affected person has repeated depressive episodes punctuated by what is called hypomania ( mini-highs ) . These euphoric states in bipolar II do not fully meet the criteria for the complete manic episodes that occur in bipolar I. Depression Symptoms of Manic DepressionPersistently sad , anxious , or `` empty '' mood . Feelings of hopelessness , pessimism . Feelings of guilt , worthlessness , helplessness . Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed , including sex . Insomnia , early-morning awakening , or oversleeping . Decreased appetite and/or weight loss , or overeating and weight gain . Fatigue , decreased energy , being `` slowed down . '' Thoughts of death or suicide , suicide attempts . Restlessness , irritability . Difficulty concentrating , remembering , making decisions . Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment , such as headaches , digestive disorders , and chronic pain.Mania Symptoms of Manic DepressionInappropriate elation .

"was there a man named john appleseed ... ..and did he start out in illonoise ? Johnny Appleseed in real life was one John Chapman , born on September 26,1774 near Leominster , Massachusetts . Little is known of his early life , but he apparently received a good education which helped him in his later years . By the time he was 25 years old , he had become a nursery man and had planted apple trees in the western portions of New York and Pennsylvania . Some of the orchards in those areas were said to have originated with his apple trees.When the rich and fertile lands lying south of the Great Lakes and west of the Ohio river were opened for settlement in the early 1800 's , John Chapman was among the very first to explore the new territory . This was the Northwest Territory from which the states of Ohio , Michigan , Indiana , and Illinois were later formed . For nearly half a century Johnny Appleseed roamed his territory . When settlers arrived , they found John Chapman 's young apple trees ready for sale . In the years that followed , he became known as the Apple Tree Man , or Johnny Appleseed.His manner of operation was simple . He went into the wildreness with a bag of apple seeds on his back until he found a likely spot for planting . There he would clear the land by chopping out weeds and brush by hand . Then he planted his apple seeds in neat rows and built a brush fence around the area to keep out straying animals . His nurseries varied in size . Some were only an acre or so , others covered many acres.He did all of the work himself , living alone for weeks at a time with only the Indians and wild animals for companionship . He never carried a gun or weapon of any kind . He was a deeply religious man who lived by the Golden Rule and had no fear of man or beast . Indians accepted him as a friend , and he is reputed to have talked at times to the wild animals who watched him as he worked in his nurseries . Undoubtedly , they sensed his kind and gentle nature . Once , it is reported , he was caught in a snow storm and crept into a hollow fallen tree for shelter . He found it occupied by a hibernating bear and her cubs , but spent the night there nonetheless . There is no report , however , of how much space he kept between them and himself.John Chapman was a practical businessman as well as a sincere Christian . Somewhere , somehow , he had caught a vision of the winderness blossoming with apple trees , orchard after orchard of carefully nurtured trees , whose fragrant blossoms gave promise of a fruitful harvest for the settlers . Willingly he endured the hardships of his wilderness life as he worked to make his dream come true . His sturdy young trees lightened the hearts and lifted the spirits of many settlers , for there is a suggestion of a permanent and loving home when one plants fruit trees around a cabin.He sold his trees for a few pennies each , accepting any of the coins current on the frontier . Some had no cash , and from those he accepted a simple promise to pay at a later date . Few failed to keep their word . He sometimes accepted payment in used clothing.As he was a small man , his bartered clothing usually fit him poorly . This led to some of the humorous descriptions of his appearance in those early years . Like many of the settlers , he went barefooted a great deal because shoes were hard to come by and seldom fit his tough gnarled feet . As he ate no meat , he carried a stewpot or kettle with him . In this he could gather nuts or berries in season , carry water , get milk from a settler 's cow , boil potatoes , or drop a handful of coarse-ground meal into the boiling water to make an unpalatable but nourishing meal . He has been pictured wearing such a pot on his head , but more likely he kept it tied to his pack rather than let it bounce on his head.He preferred to walk , carrying his precious apple seeds and the simplest of camping gear on his back . He also used a boat , canoe , or raft to transfer larger loads of seeds along the many waterways . Customarily , he obtained his apple seeds every fall . At first , he",0

They are believed to be created by the eath 's magnetic field interacting with charged particles known as solar wind . To the extent that we believe the earth 's core responsible for creating the earth 's magnetic field , I guess the earth 's core has some relevance . As the solar winds encounter the earth 's magnetic field , the radiation becomes trapped within the field . They are repelled from areas of stronger magnetic field where field lines converge . Two alternative hypotheses have been proposed . Possibly the Van Allen Belts are lefor over from the aurora , and another argument is that they are the result of volcanic activity of the earth . Some scientists beleive that they may have a beneficial effect on the planet providing some protection from solar wind , and that weakening them would harm both electronics and living organisms . there has been a proposal to reduce the charge of the belts , which are a hazard to satellites .",0

"i am studying architecture and i am thinking to quit ... it 's to hard , and not filling me up.. ? my parent 's would kill me if i do so ... Architecture is difficult , and you may be very wise to think about it twice . The hours are incredibly long and it is hard to keep up with all the laws and changes , etc . It also is difficult finding a good-paying architectural position . Why do n't you look into closely related fields such as interior design , architectural rendering , etc . If you were drawn into studying architecture , you are most likely a very visual person - are you interested in art ? Listen to what your heart is telling you . Pay close attention to that because it is leading you , and do n't listen to people who call you a loser . It 's not true .

"where can i find electric field , magnatic field ? ? Where ever an electic charge is made to oscillate there will be electic field and magnetic field.Nowadays every one is familiar with cell phones.The cell phones receive the electric and magnetic field produced at the transmitting end.Radio , T.V are other examples of receiving electic and magnetic fields.Very very familiar example is the light which we see .

"Is there anything one can do to `` spice '' up what appears to be a dull relationship ( marriage ) ? We love each other , but , I do n't know ... it seems to have lost that magic after 14 years . We are more roommates now . Here 's a hint : Men like women to show initiative with romance and eroticsm -- too often in relationships it 's considered the `` man 's job '' to get things moving ! This will sound corny , but give it a shot : First , if you 've got kids , send them to the grandparents for the night in advance without him knowing ( say on a Friday ) . Next , turn off all the lights in the house and place scented candles in the bedroom and run a hot bubble bath just before he normally arives home . Have some wine and two wine glasses at the ready on the coffee table , and rose petals on the floor leading a trail to the bedroom -- or whereever you 're most memorable encounter that you can remember occurred . Personally , I like David Sanborn or some other smooth jazz playing in the background . Music is important to setting the mood , and if you 've got cable or a dish , you can tune it to the music of your choice . Just before he gets home , slip into a nice satin & lace nightie and cover it with a heavy robe . When he gets to the door , be there waiting to flash him and let him know what you 've got in store for the evening . Not in a crude way , mind you . Most importantly , take your time ... do n't rush . The anticipation of that which is to come will be as intense as the act itself . Hope that helps ! Peace , JayZ",0

"If jesus is Lord / God when he died on the cross who kept the universe in order ? Is the trinity false ? Excellent question . But unfortunately , I have yet to hear a good answer . God the Almighty Creator does n't even blink for a second , nonetheless die . If this were true and God died on the cross , then ALL existance would cease.Here 's what makes the trinity questionable : If you have a creature ( i.e . a created being ) , and a third of that creature dies while the other two-thirds are still alive , then that creature has n't really died . All parts would have to die for the creature to be considered dead . So if this applies to a created being , how can it not apply to the Creator ? If a third of God dies , but the other two-thirds are still alive , then that third did n't really die ; especially when he 's resurrected within a number of hours.The fact is that death in itself is a creation . Therefore the dimension of death can not be applied to an infinite entity which exists outside the realm of all creation . i.e . No creator , or any part of a creator , dies.What does that mean anyways ? What does it mean that a third of God has died ? ? ? This can only indicate that the trinity is not true ; it 's merely a pagan practice that has filtered down to blemish the noble message of Prophet Jesus ( peace be upon him ) . ( see link below ) For those who say angels , well who was sustaining the angels in God 's absence ? Did you really hear yourself say that ? ?",0

"what is biodiesel ? Biodiesel is a fuel that is made from either waste oil ( collected from restaurants ) or pure vegetable oil . It is often mixed with `` regular '' diesel . You can buy it at some gas stations , although it is n't common . The ratio of biodiesel to regular diesel varies depending on the vehicle and the season ( less biodiesel in the winter , for example ) . The benefits of biodiesel include lessening our dependence on foreign oil , increasing our use of renewable resources , especially those that are produced in our own country , and cleaner fuel both in use and in production . The US government 's standards for regular diesel are not as stringent as they are in other countries , although that will change in the next year or so . Right now , there are few American automakers who produce diesel passenger vehicles . You 'll find diesel trucks , but I do n't think there are any American made cars . This may change as the quality of diesel improves and as biodiesel becomes more readily available.Biodiesel is fairly easy to make . There are a lot of `` home brewers '' out there who collect waste oil from restaurants , filter it as necessary , and process it into biodiesel . My boss makes it in our shop and we use it in our company vehicles . Except for the occasional nasty smelling batch of cooking oil , it 's great . We 're greatly reducing our company 's fuel costs because the diesel vehicles have much better gas mileage , and we 're producing the biodiesel for less than $ 1.25 per gallon .",0

"How can I stop my computer speaker wires from picking up and playing a radio station ? I have n't identified the frequency of the radio station as yet . Perhaps your computer speaker wires can pick up a radio station because they form a good antena ( especially if the radio station is nearby ) . Think of any practical means of ruining the wires as antenas . A vertical radio antena ( mast ) transmits best to another antena that is vertical and therefore parallel . Avoid verttical speaker wires . Twisting the wires are making loops may confuse and cancel the signal . Antenas transmit radio AM waves of fixed wavelengths and receiver antenas work best when they are specific fractions of the wavelength ( such as half wave ) . Vary the effective length of your wires if there is any slack by gathering it up and securing it with twist wires . Perhaps it is possible to run a portion of the wire through steel pipe or tubing that would shield the wires ( or wrap steel wire around a portion ? ) .Of course , try the system with one speaker at a time and check for differences . You may be blaming the condition on the speakers when there is another internal cause . Long ago my sisters had a very simple 45 RPM record player that picked up taxi calls . Just the power cable can be at fault as an atena . Good luck .",0

"Has anyone lived in India ? What was your experience ? I want to visit but India is so vast and has so many appealing areas , that I would n't know where to begin ? Any advice ? it depends on what you want to do and see . I would n't say that I lived there , but I was there for 5 months . The longest period of time i was in one place was 2 months . Honestly i do n't even know where to begin describing what it was like . it was without a doubt a very positive , but sometimes stressful , experience . I think that everybody should travel to india at least once . I traveled only in the north , so that is the only area i can really give advice on . For the south i heard that Kerala , Hampi , and Pondicherry were the places to see , but I could n't tell you if that is true . To start with let me say that traveling in india is not as daunting as it seems . i started out with a program , but stayed on after its end when i realized that i would be able to get around on my own . unless you have about a year , you will probably not see everything , so do n't worry about seeing everything . You can probably get by just fine with only english , but it never hurts to know a little hindi or whatever the local language is , if only to see the shock on people 's faces . lol . The cost is very cheap , you can easily get by on $ 10 a day ( room , board , insurance , food , and maybe transportation ) . Sanitation is a big problem over there ( to us ! ) , but if you just use common sense you will be fine . it is a very safe country for the most part , but if you are a lone female you do need to exercise some caution . nearly every female traveller i came across had at least one complaint of minor harassment.the places that i saw that i really liked and/or you have to see are in the north : ladakh , dharamsala , manali , kashmir are all in the mountains and are much more relaxed than the cities in the central plains , although kashmir is not so safe in rajasthan : jodhpur without a doubt , jaipur is more popular with tourists but i did n't like it as muchin central india : agra of course , orchha ( near jhansi ) , varanasi ( stressful , but worth it for the sights and culture shock ) , khajuraho ( although they really go after tourists here ) , and delhi of course ( but it can be a bit stressful if you stay there too long ) in the east : darjeeling is a good place to chill , and i heard sikkim is amazingthe best advice i have , if you have n't already done it , is to get a guidebook ( i used lonely planet ) now and start looking at pics and reading about the places . i really hope that you get as much out of it as i did.if you do have any other specific questions , you can email me if you want : jeff32224 @ yahoo.comgood luck !",0

"Why does n't any one care about Africa ? First of all , I do n't think that 's a fair assessment . There are plenty of people who do in fact care very much about Africa and its people . UNICEF , Doctors Without Borders , CARE , and just about every AIDS group you can think of is involved over in Africa quite a lot.If you mean `` Why is n't Africa a higher priority for most of the world 's goverments ? '' then I think you are hitting nearer the mark . I 'm no expert on Africa , but I think there 's a couple of reasons why it does n't peg a bit higher on the attention-o-meter insofar as the US is concerned . Hitherto , Africa has n't had a whole lot to offer us . Sounds harsh , I know , but it 's the truth . We are forced to deal with the Middle East because they are a big energy source , but if the oil was n't there we would n't be either . African oil is starting to become a market player now too , so some of our attention may be shifting towards that region.The other main reason is the perception that Africa is a continent filled with people who simply can not get their collective sh*t together . It 's brimming with petty dictatorships , bloody coups , transient goverments , unending civil wars and ethnic violence . In the international arena there just is n't anyone reliable to deal with on a nation-to-nation level . Our news stories have left me at least with the view that Africa is a limitless sinkhole into which all the world 's largesse could be poured without doing much more than fattening up a corrupt few at the top and financing more armies to fight in the wars and/or commit the heinous genocides we read about all too often.Do the African people suffer ? Of course they do ! Most of those organizations I listed at the top are all about addressing the suffering on the individual 's level . But until Africa starts to produce more responsible goverments , not too much will ever be done geopolitically to help them .",0

( 4 is divisible by 2 and is the largest whole number that is less than or equal to 5 ) .5 / 2 remainder is 1.5 modulo 2 is 1.5 % 2 is 1.One way of expressing this in some programming languages is : a = 5 , b = 2remainder = b * ( ( a / b ) - int ( a / b ) ) remainder = 2 * ( ( 5 / 2 ) - int ( 5 / 2 ) ) remainder = 2 * ( ( 2.5 ) - int ( 2.5 ) ) remainder = 2 * ( ( 2.5 ) - ( 2 ) ) remainder = 2 * ( 0.5 ) remainder = 1",0
"Why is DSL never available in my area ? Why is DSL never available in my area ? DSL has a distance limitation , and this is most likely the reason it 's not available in your area ( it 's not available in my neighborhood either ) . For DSL to work properly you have to be less than 18,000 or so wire feet away from your telco 's central office . If you are too far away they wo n't offer it . There are technologies to extend it , however , most of the telco 's ( Verizon and AT & T ) are switching to fiber networks . Verizon is going to go with fiber to the home and AT & T with fiber to the node . When those roll outs are finally completed , you 'll probably be able to get vdsl ( very fast dsl ) in your area . Might take a few years though .",0
"Will road rage occur ? Traveling in a car at the speed of sound , you blow your horn at the car in front of you also traveling at the speed of sound . Will the car in front of you hear the horn ? Will he give you the finger if he does ? The sound will reach the car in front of you . Although it may seem as though it would not , considering that you are already traveling at the speed of sound , therefore you may think the sound waves go as the same speed as your car therefore not traveling any faster than you are and not getting to the car in front of you . However , this is not the case . This can be explained using Einstein 's theory of relativity . Einstein describes `` frames of reference '' and in your frame of reference , you are not moving ; everything else is moving . Everything in your car is stationary relative to everything else , this is why you do n't feel like you 're moving , and if you throw a book sideways , it does n't fly backwards with the speed your vehicle is moving , this is because the car , yourself , and the book are all moving with the same speed your car is moving . They are all stationary relative to each other . When the sound waves are created , they move in all directions at the speed of sound ( 331 m/s ) , so in your frame of reference , they would be moving at 331 m/s away from the car in all directions . This means from the frame of reference of a person standing outside of your car , the sound waves would actually appear to be moving at twice the speed of sound . This is just like if you threw a ball forward out from the car at 15 m/s , it would appear to an outsider to be moving at that speed plus the speed of sound ( well in a vacuum anyway , or before air resistance took over ) To use a better example of these frames of reference , you know that the earth is rotating . It is rotating at 1070 mi/hr at the equator , yet it seems not to be moving at all , it is our frame of reference when we are standing 'still . ' the speed of sound is no different traveling in different directions on the earth because of this rotation.and yes , he would probably give you the finger . I mean , he is going at the speed of sound , how impatient are you ?",0
"what is the relation between feng shui and architecture ? Feng Shui is a science , based in numerology among other factors as the 5 elements ( Fire , Wood , Water , Metal & Earth ) the 8 cardinal directions and the application of many other formulas.According to Feng Shui we all have a Kua number , this number is determined by your date of birth . Each kua number has 8 directions , we all have 4 good directions and 4 bad directions . Also the date of building is very important , that way one can know in which period the house is being built or was built , right now we find ourselves in period 8 ! Let 's say U want to built a house and your very best first direction is North , then U will orientand design your home plans according to these directions . A total Feng Shui house can be design by this Kua number and also with the help of different formulas e.g Land Scape Feng Shui,8 Mansions , Flying Star , Etc.Plan the layout of a house by identifying the good sectors and not so good sectors after examining the flying star natal chart of a house . Identify if there are any specials such as parent string combinations in your flying star chart , and plant to augment their good luck by incorporating an open-spaced concept within your house . Then work with shapes when activating the feng shui of the different sectors of your house.Actually Feng Shui is becoming more and more popular with the years and many architects are already working together with Feng Shui Consultants to design floor plans of a house , building or residential complex ! Many celebreties follow this science , e.g . Donald Trump ! If you would like more information please visit www.wofs.com You will finding both interesting and facinating.I am a Feng Shui Consultant , studied in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia with Lillian Too , one of the most famous Feng Shui Consultants and Best Seller author !",0
"I just bought my nephews a used stereo microscope ( AO 570 , 7x to 42x power ) . What are some fun things to view ? They are wanting a telescope , but at their age ( 10 and 11 ) , I thought they might have more fun looking at various things under a microscope . This scope has an excellent light ( 48 LED circle ) and the lenses are perfectly clear.I 'm afraid , though , that they might get bored pretty quickly if I do n't think of some things to have ready for them to look at . A coin at 42x is interesting , and so is a fly , but I need a LOT more things lined up if you have any suggestions . Wanting them to see things under the scope that they would never know about , even if it is `` everyday '' things.Thanks . Do n't forget that your samples must be small and THIN ( flat ) . If the sample is too big/thick then no light will pass through to the lenses.Most things are best viewed after mounting them in a drop of water under a cover slip.1 . Crystals of salt , icing sugar , etc.2 . Fibres of cotton , wool , synthetics , string , etc.3 . The torn edges of paper.4 . The individual dots of colour from non-glossy pictures . You will probably have to add a bit more illumination from above the sample for this by shining a light onto it ( e.g . desk light ) .5 . Leaf 'skeletons'.6 . Living leaves - from a potted plant ( e.g . a 'spider plant ' ) bend the leaf and clip it between two slides . ( Additional top illumination needed. ) 7 . The thin 'skin ' from between the 'leaves ' of an onion ( onion epidermis ) .8 . The edge of a razor blade or sharp knife ( with top illumination ) .9 . Strands of spider webs.10 . Dust.11 . By gently using a potato peeler you can make thin sections of all sorts of plant parts . Usually only the very edges of these sections are suitable for viewing . You might like to stain plant samples with a drop of iodine ( use instead of water ) under the cover slip.12 . If you have a wood-plane then make thin samples of different types of wood. ( P.S . Forgive my UK spelling )",0

Likewise , be sure to stick to darker demin and fabrics .",0

You stop seeing the advantage in being gone , in wanting to see others punished for not treating you as you think they should.And you start treating yourself as though you were someone special , someone that you really , really care about . You give them ( you ) the best of whatever you have - the best attention , the best potato chip out of the bag , the nicest clothes in your closet . You start telling yourself that you are someone special .

There is a lot of mixing of cultures there , so you will find whites , Hispanics , and people of Indian and Asian descent in large numbers . The west coast is also warmer climate-wise due to the proximity to the desert and the sea . More importantly , for some reason I found the people friendlier than anywhere else in the states . The food is also inspired by different cultures , but you can find a lot of authentic Mexican food there . One word of caution , the west coast is pretty expensive to stay !

Do they have Airforce ROTC at Louisiana Tech ? How do you receive a signing bonus for the Airforce ? Signing bonuses are generally offered to people who enlist as an incentive to do so . They vary based on which profession a person enlists for ( generally giving more money to `` harder '' professions ) and the length of the enlistment ( more money goes to those who enlist for longer terms ) . I do n't think enlistment bonuses are given to those who go through ROTC .,0

"WAt would reduce the resistance of a metal wire ? Increasing its thickness , temperature , or length ? ? Or would it be all of those 3 ? increasing thickness , decreasing temperature , and decreasing length would all reduce the resistance of a metal wire . so the only thing that reduces it by increasing is thickness.a good way to remember this is just to reason it out . if the wire is thicker , current can move more freely and with less resistance then a thinner , more constricted wire . the electrons in the current would have more space to move around . if you increase temperature , it would cause more resistance , because with temperature , comes heat , and heat just makes more resistance . lower temperatures allow the current to move more freely , which is why superconductors work really well at low temperatures . and length , well the longer the wire is , the more the resistance is going to build up along the whole thing ... the electrons are just encountering more resistance because the wire is longer..",0

"How do I install memory into my computer ? My computer savvy friend left me hanging w/ RAM she ordered for me via Ebay and no instructions.Have Gateway system bought secondhand . PLEASE , help me ! Installing Memory:1 . Open the case . You can leave all of the plugs in place and components attached.2 . Get grounded . Before touching the new memory or anything inside the computer , you need to get grounded . The easiest way to be sure that you are grounded is to use an inexpensive antistatic wrist strap that can be purchased at a local electronics or computer store . If you don ’ t have a wrist strap , touch the inside of the chassis while the PC is still plugged in ; this will ground you . Once you are grounded , unplug the computer from the wall.3 . Find the place to insert the module . Look for other memory like the memory you have just purchased . You will see empty slots next to the memory that is already in place.4 . Pick up the memory module by the side edges . Don ’ t touch the flat surfaces or the contacts along the bottom . Orient the memory to match the memory that is already installed . Insert the memory module in the first empty slot next to the currently installed memory . Different types of memory install slightly differently.a . DIMMs and most newer types of memory are simply inserted into the slot with a gentle downward pressure . The clips on both sides of the module must snap into place for the module to be properly seated.b . SIMMs are a slightly older type of memory found in most computers more than three years old . They are inserted at a 45-degree angle and then rotated to a vertical position . Again , the supporting clips will snap into place.5 . Replace the cover , plug in the computer , and turn it on . In some computers , you will see the amount of RAM scroll by , confirming that the computer has recognized the new memory . If the memory has not been installed properly , there may be error messages , or the computer may freeze . If anything seems abnormal , remove and reinstall the new memory . Once everything is running properly , you can hold down the ALT key while double-clicking on My Computer to see the System Properties screen which will confirm the amount of memory that your computer thinks is installed .",0

"Why is The ocean salty ? [ be specific ] ? All water , even rain water , contains dissolved chemicals which scientists call `` salts . '' But not all water tastes salty . Water is fresh or salty according to individual judgment , and in making this decision man is more convinced by his sense of taste than by a laboratory test . It is one 's taste buds that accept one water and reject another.A simple experiment illustrates this . Fill three glasses with water from the kitchen faucet . Drink from one and it tastes fresh even though some dissolved salts are naturally present . Add a pinch of table salt to the second , and the water may taste fresh or slightly salty depending on a personal taste threshold and on the amount of salt held in a `` pinch . '' But add a teaspoon of salt to the third and your taste buds vehemently protest that this water is too salty to drink ; this glass of water has about the same salt content as a glass of sea water.Obviously , the ocean , in contrast to the water we use daily , contains unacceptable amounts of dissolved chemicals ; it is too salty for human consumption . HOW SALTY IS THE OCEAN ? ... How salty the ocean is , however , defies ordinary comprehension . Some scientists estimate that the oceans contain as much as 50 quadrillion tons ( 50 million billion tons ) of dissolved solids.If the salt in the sea could be removed and spread evenly over the Earth 's land surface it would form a layer more than 500 feet thick , about the height of a 40-story office building . The saltiness of the ocean is more understandable when compared with the salt content of a fresh-water lake . For example , when 1 cubic foot of sea water evaporates it yields about 2.2 pounds of salt , but 1 cubic foot of fresh water from Lake Michigan contains only one one-hundredth ( 0.01 ) of a pound of salt , or about one sixth of an ounce . Thus , sea water is 220 times saltier than the fresh lake water . What arouses the scientist 's curiosity is not so much why the ocean is salty , but why it is n't fresh like the rivers and streams that empty into it . Further , what is the origin of the sea and of its `` salts '' ? And how does one explain ocean water 's remarkably uniform chemical composition ? To these and related questions , scientists seek answers with full awareness that little about the oceans is understood.Illustration : Sources of salts in the ocean.THE ORIGIN OF THE SEA ... In popular language , `` ocean '' and `` sea '' are used interchangeably . Today 's seas are the North and South Pacific , North and South Atlantic , Indian and Arctic Oceans and the Antarctic waters or seas.Scientists believe that the seas are as much as 500 million years old because animals that lived then occur as fossils in rocks which once were under ancient seas . There are several theories about the origin of the seas , but no single theory explains all aspects of this puzzle . Many earth scientists agree with the hypothesis that both the atmosphere and the oceans have accumulated gradually through geologic time from some process of `` degassing '' of the Earth 's interior . According to this theory , the ocean had its origin from the prolonged escape of water vapor and other gases from the molten igneous rocks of the Earth to the clouds surrounding the cooling Earth . After the Earth 's surface had cooled to a temperature below the boiling point of water , rain began to fall and continued to fall for centuries . As the water drained into the great hollows in the Earth 's surface , the primeval ocean came into existence . The forces of gravity prevented the water from leaving the planet.SOURCES OF THE SALTS ... Sea water has been defined as a weak solution of almost everything . Ocean water is indeed a complex solution of mineral salts and of decayed biologic matter that results from the teeming life in the seas . Most of the ocean 's salts were derived from gradual processes such the breaking up of the cooled igneous rocks of the Earth & # 39",0
"are chiropractors legitimate doctors ? I do n't understand what they do . How is what they do considered practicing medicine ? Chiropractors are doctors in a sense that they have earned a DC ( Doctor of Chiropractic ) . But they are prohibited by law to prescribe medicines other then natural herbs and things like that . They DO NOT have to take the MCAT , they DO NOT have to go through residencies . There are 2 types of fully licensed doctors in the U.S. which are MD ( Doctor of Allopathic medicine ) and DO ( Docotor of Osteopathic Medicine ) . A Chiropractor is limited in what they can and can not do . For example , they are prohibited to practice in a hospital , they can not perform surgery or treat mental disorders . But the choice of whether a DC is a legitimate doctor will be up to the patient , someone with a PhD . can call themselves a docotor also.In closing , my opinion DO , MD or DC , they all must work together to achieve the one central goal which is to help imporve one 's quality of life . Only then will the patient have the best chance to be free of sickness . But I prefer to go to a MD or DO .",0
"do other premenopausal women have incredibly painful high-flow periods after skipping two or three months ? Consider this ... It 's possible that your `` high-flow periods '' are not actual periods at all , but just your body becoming unable to hold all the blood that has collected in the uterus due to not having a period for two to three months . The body `` releases '' the blood , and then goes back to not having `` periods '' until there is again too much blood to hold . This is one of the experiences caused by an endocrine disorder called PCOS ( polycystic ovarian syndrome ) that can cause erratic or skipped periods , and can cause exactly the painful high-flow `` periods '' of which you speak . You should visit an endocrinologist and have the doctor check your hormone levels to make sure that everything is normal . PCOS can be treated with medication and diet . There are other symptoms to the disorder as well , and if left untreated , the disorder can cause long term health problems such as diabetes or heart disease .",0

"why does society say the skinnier you are , the prettier and more accepted you will be ? I think it 's based off of society valuing what influential and rich people that they iconize look like . The `` elite '' have the time and resources to devote to looking their `` best '' and usually that best is the opposite of what the average person in society looks like.In the US it 's hard to stay fit because most of us do n't have jobs that keep us physically fit ( or in the case of kids , they do n't `` get out and play '' as much as they used to ) . Also the cheapest food that is available is the worst for you but is the highest quantity that most people in the US consume which leads to so many people being overweight . So the opposite ( being skinny ) is what 's idolized . Mostly it 's wealthy people who have time to excersize and `` personal trainers '' and such to help them stay fit ... the rest of us are on our own.Back a few hundred years ago , if you were overweight it was a major status symbol because adequate nutrition was hard to come by , and if you had enough food to be fat , you must have been really well off . Again , what was attractive was the opposite of the average person who had to work hard at manual labor and probably did n't get enough to eat and so was skinny.Tanning is another example ... a while ago it was considered unattractive because if you were tanned it meant you were some serf working outside all day instead of being able to stay inside away from the sun . Now it 's the wealthy that have the most leisure time to spend outdoors so tanning is what 's considered attractive .",0

"What is the right age to get married ? Age is n't as important as maturity and so many other factors , like life goals , and personality compatibility . We all are at some stage in life .

"Will we ever evolve to Homo sapiens futuria as it has been predicted ? Is nature that predictable I would have to disagree with David to some extent . To evolve into a different species we would have changed enough so that different subpopulations of humans could no longer interbreed . Humans display a range of social and technological aptitudes and capacities throughout earth , the majority of which have n't even heard a dialtone let alone participated in any form of advanced travel or communications processes . However , none of these people are incabable of doing so if provided with the appropriate education needed . This suggest that there has n't been any change in our molecular ( genetic ) makeup that provides us with these advanced technologies -- which is where the changes are needed to happen for biological evolution to occur . Even if you wanted to argue that social evolution has distinguished industrialized man from our primitive brethern enough to warrant a new species distinction , I would argue that we still have n't met one of the key requirements for doing so , there are no subgroups of humans on earth that are incapable of interbreeding with one another . Until that happens , no we have n't evolved from Homo sapiens sapiens to Homo sapiens futura . However , we will evolve into someting different ! This is a certainty -- as long as our species does n't become extint before that can happen ! But do n't expect that Homo sapiens will evolve into just one different species . Depending on what our environment ( s ) dictates , humans could evolve into numerous other species . Through the process of evolution , it is inevitable , but at the same time it is not predictable .",0

A good way to track when you are ovulating and whether you are fertile or not is to chart your cervical mucus and temperature .

If this is the case , just hit the bars & you 'll find someone to warm your bed .

I 'm not trying to be hurtful in any way ; I 'm trying to honestly explain to you how your above approach might look to women . Me ?

"When people talk about their `` relationship '' with Jesus , what exactly do they mean ? By characterizing one 's faith in Christ as having a relationship with him , a person implies that that there is an ongoing dialog of sorts ( perhaps non-verbal ) between the believer and the Lord.I mean , if you 've been touched in some way by Jesus once in your life , would n't it be more accurately characterized as an encounter , or an introduction ? Perhaps even an acquaintance ? I recently went to a Starbucks in an unfamiliar town . I paid the girl behind the counter $ 1.70 for my cup of coffee , and left . I do n't believe I will ever see her again . Does that mean I have a `` relationship '' as well ? And if you 've maintained ongoing contact with Jesus , then certainly , you would have sufficient personal experience with your savior to no longer characterize your beliefs as `` faith . '' After all this contact with the Lord , should n't you regard it as `` fact ? `` Just wondering ... It is okay if you think I am nuts but here goes.I talk to God by prayer , sometimes silently and sometimes outloud . God talks to me occassionaly at His time frame , In other words I do n't have to be in a prayerful or spiritual mood for Him to speak . I can not explain it but when He speaks to me , it is not silent in my head and it is not audible so that others can hear it but it is clearly audible to me.So yes , I have a relationship with Him . I also can feel His prescense in my life.Look to John 8:47 , & 10:26-30 Jesus stated my sheep hear my voice and they know me ( Jesus ) and follow me . God may not communicate with everyone the same as He does with me but if you do not hear His voice in some manner then you do n't know Him . My relationship with Him indeed started out as faith but you are correct in the change that takes place . I can not prove this relationship to anyone but to me it is fact . You can not achieve fact without first having faith .",0

How come the Cro Magnons ; the ancestors of Homo Sapiens had larger cranial capacities than us ? I have read that they were more intelligent then us.Why is this exception in the evolutionary trends ? Probably they had taken a lot more meat than us . Eating meat does grow your brain . Predators do have bigger brains than preys.Their brains are bigger because of the need to calculate the risk and to overtake the preys . Cro Magnons had bigger cranial capacities could have been because they desperately need food especially meat to survive the weather . Their physiques had to adapt the condition and made them tacticians.Cro Magnons maybe were smarter than us in surviving the harsh condition of the world bare-handed but I think that they they were no smarter than us in using tools or making great tools . It 's like native humans or jungle people or whoever who lives in the wilderness who can bear harsh environment bare-handed compared to us living in cities with great facilities but lack experience in handling harsh conditions bare-handed .,0

"How come you never see dead pigeons ? From straightdope : '' You do n't see many dead city pigeons for a couple of reasons . The first is that scavengers make pretty quick work of them . Insects alone can reduce a deceased pigeon to a heap of feathers and bones in a week or two . Rats , dogs , or other animals may drag the carcass off into some secret corner for a late snack . City sanitation crews occasionally stir themselves to scoop up a couple.The other reason you do n't see dead pigeons is that old and feeble ones usually hole up in some out-of-the-way place so they wo n't be seen by predators . Nooks and crannies in and around buildings are always popular , but I 'd say the pigeons ' favorite spot is the ironwork underneath viaducts . I recently inspected one near the office of the newspaper that publishes my column . I found the surrounding area littered with decaying remains . Mostly these were former editors sleeping it off . However , there were a bunch of dead pigeons , too . Naturally , I paused for a moment of respectful silence . For the pigeons . I mean , pigeons and editors both do the icky on the stuff you cherish most . But at least the pigeons do n't think , `` Wow , now it sings . '' ''",0

I hope you do n't take this to be something of a cop-out answer . Light is itself an electromagnetic field that is carrying energy through space -- commonly called an electromagnetic wave or 'light ' . It is this wave that really makes things visible.Conversely , if you have no electromagnetic wave or one of an invisible wavelength , ( at least to the human eye ) then it wo n't bounce off of the object or if it does it wo n't be visible when it reaches you.The visible properties of an object are determined by how EM waves interact with the electrons near the surface of an object .

"How do we use the matter waves of the electrons in an electron microscope ? Teacher said electrons are waves ( DeBrolie ) and we computed wavelength of an electron moving fast . He said electron microscope use electron waves to see tiny things . I asked if the matter waves were electromagnetic . He said no they are matter waves . I asked if they are not electromagnetic how can we observe them in a microscope . He said ... he did not know . Could you please help me ? An electron microscope bounces electrons off of things , captures them as they bounce off and then resolves a picture from the distribution of electrons that have returned . This is the same way a light bounces off stuff and we capture the reflected photons to make a picture with our eye . We cant see electrons with our eyes , though , so we need a machine to collect the scattered electrons and a computer to put an image together based on how the electrons scattered . The reason electrons can be used to see smaller things is that they have a `` shorter wavelength '' than visible light . The debroglie wavelength is n't a complete description of the wave properties of an electron or pohoton , but it is a good way to approximate many things . The wave function that describes an electron or a photon , or anything else is NOT a `` matter '' wave . That is a poor description . The wave itself is related to the probability that you will find the electron at a certain point in space , or with a certain property like velocity or spin . Your teacher is correct in saying that the electron is a wave , this wave can tell you the probability of measurements coming out a certain way , but the electron does not have characteristics like position or velocity UNTIL you measure them . Back to your question . As you know the debrolie shortens when momentum goes up . A shorter debrolie wavelength means that the electron is generally more localized than photons , which have relatively small momementums . If you want to bounce particles ( electrons of photons ) off say , two atoms separated by 1nm , the particle your sending toward it needs to be localized enough ( have a short enough wavelength ) so that it hits only one , and not both of them . A green photon would come waving in , hit both , and as it came back , the wave would be spread out so much that you could find it anywhere , and you couldnt make a picture of the two atoms no matter how many photons you bounced off of them . If you use electrons though , their wave function could be localized to bounce of only one or the other and based on where you measured it when it returned , you could use the information to resolve an image of the two atoms . This same idea is why you cant ( I 'm pretty sure ) resolve the image of the lunar landar on the moon with visible light . By the time the photons get back here from the moon , their wave functions have spread out to cover too large an area , and we cant tell exactly where they came from , resulting in a fuzzy , non-detailed image .",0

IS IT TRUE THAT SEEING LIGHTNING WITH NAKED EYES AFFECT THEM ? It depends on the intensity of the flash . Have you ever looked at the flame/flash of someone who is welding ? The light is very bright and can produce spots in front of your eyes . Have you noticed that the people who are doing the welding are wearing dark goggles or a mask with a dark lens ? That 's the reason . They do n't want to get welder 's burn or flash burn of the eyes . Disjointed sight can last a long while if you are close enough to a bright enough light of any type .,0

"Since reparations has been given due to past crimes against humanity should n't African Americans receive also ? Due to slavery and 400 yr+ of oppression also the unequal treatment of blacks in America due to White supremacy and injustice . Reparations in the United States have generally been limited to the survivors of government harm . Watch your terminology , though - slavery was not a crime until 1865 , since the government permitted slavery and only outlawed it through the Thirteenth Amendment after the Civil War.For instance , the United States paid survivors of Japanese internment programs from WWII . The program , however , was limited to survivors . No survivors of slavery exist today.A current reparations program would be too bizarre to fathom . All African-Americans were not harmed by slavery , after all , since some immigrated to America after slavery , or since some have no slave ancestors . It would be virtually impossible to require proof of slave ancestry , and then to divide some sum proportionately.Additionally , the vague `` 400 yr+ of oppression '' is unhelpful in crafting legislation . Slavery ended . Segregation did exist also , that 's ended for over 50 years now . If you 're problem with `` White supremacy and injustice , '' then I 'm afraid that no amount of money will solve the problem . Instead , educating future generations and winning over hearts and minds is the most effective remedy to injustice .",0

"Help Me Please ! Algebra no understand ! ? How do you find the slope of an linear equation your help would be great ! The slope , as it was taught to me simply long ago is just this : `` The rise over the run . '' What this means is the distance of the 'y ' coordinate , divided by the distance of the 'x ' coordinate.To give an example that 's a little more easy to grasp , consider walking up a flight of stairs . Measure the distance from the bottom floor to the floor at the top of the stairs , that height is your 'rise ' . Now , measure the distance between the first stair on the flight and the last stair that was climbed horizontally , and that is your 'run'.Once you have those two measurements , you can calculate the slope by dividing the height of the floor above by the length taken up by the stairs to get there . Draw the stairs as a right triangle.The right side is the rise , the bottom is the run , and the 'hypotenuse ' is the square root of the sum of both . The 'slope ' , is the right side divided by the bottom .",0

"What is the best music creation software to use for a windows xp computer ? I want a computer program that lets me make new songs by adding beats and sounds and lets me make remixes to songs from my library on my computer . It depends on how much you want to program your own sounds verus leveraging pre-canned loops and samples culled from the songs you want to remix.I 'm still a big fan of Acid -- - Orignally from Sonic Foundry but now a product offered by Sony Music : http : //www.sonymediasoftware.com/products/acidfamily.aspAcid is excellent for working with loops -- it allows you to easily time-stretch loops and transpose them to work well with other loops culled from other sources . A lot of what makes people love Garageband ( Apple 's entry-level music software ) was first pioneered in Acid . The main limitation of Acid is that it has limited or no support for the creation of your own original sounds and sequences -- it 's more of a loop arranger.Another outstanding application is Propellerheads Reason 3.0 ( http : //www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/ ) Reaon gives you an entire virtual rack of synthesizers , samplers , and effects that you can intuitively connect with virtual patch cables . Every knob is designed to be twiddled in real time and the best thing is that all these modifications can be recorded for playback or fine-tuning.Finally , a third application you might want to check out is Ableton Live ( http : //www.ableton.com/index.php ? main=live ) Live is extremely popular among performing musicians today because it is optimized for live performance or on-the-fly creation/arranging of songs . The application is a bit like Acid in that it is mainly intended for working with building blocks of pre-created loops ( either instrument loops or sampled material ) with an interface and workflow that makes it very easy to add , subtract , and tweak stuff as the rest of the song plays back . Between the 3 applications I 'm sure you 'll find something that work for you . Best of all , you can download free trial versions of all applications to see for yourself . Happy remixing !",0

"Is there such thing as a 'Dixie-crat ' anymore ? Is there a public figure who you would consider to be one ? DixieCrat was n't just a term meaning southern conservative Democrat , it was a real party ( it 's official name was the `` State 's Rights party '' ) formed as a 3rd party in 1948 , with Strom Thurmond as it 's presidential candidate . ( here was their official platform in 1948 , including segregation- http : //www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/dixiecrat1.html ) it pretty much fell apart after the 1948 election.Basically , a dixiecrat is a person that stands by the old line democrat platform of segregationist policies ( the Democrats used to be the conservative party , and the Republican party was the progressive party- this started to change between the election cycles of 1932 and 1940 with FDR ) - the dixiecrats were formed in response to Truman 's integration of the armed services and the overall democrat civil rights plank.Basically in answer to your question , no there really are n't any people around anymore that believe in the Democratic party but are against it 's policies . Even `` yellow dog '' Democrats are no longer the type of people that support the party without supporting it 's causes . The death knell for the dixiecrats was when Thurmond switched over to the Republican party ... the rest fell in line behind him like dominos .",0

"Earth is a phenomena and a woman too is a phenomena .Man is part of this phenomena . Why GOD is called HE ? read Concept of God has emerged in the mankind after being born and based on the behaviour pattern of human beings alone.Religions have unable to convey the essence and existance of GOD which could unite every human being without doubts.Religions have created more doubts . However many followers , which kept dividing in numbers , according to technical interpretations , and , became politicl force.Reality of the ABSOLUTE got lost.Earth lost importance , motherhood too lost significance.What is reality ? A spermis a phenomena but is part of of a phenomena called Ovum.Mensurations periods of a woman are like monsoon periods on Earth which prepares itself for creating life all arround .Woman sheds her blood and earth the essence of blood , water.In stead of calling let us save this Earth , let Us say O ! mother Earth accept us with LOVE in YOUR WOMB .The GOD inside this phenomena will listen to your prayers .God is experienced in every mode of nature and not outside it as propagated by religion God is commonly referred to in the masculine sense because of the relationship that primarily judaism based religions wished to portray between god and mankind . God the Father , because at the time all the ancient religious texts for these religions were written a family was dominated by the father and rather than using the metaphor of the mother , which would imply at the time that there was some other superior to the God figure , they used a masculine term . This term has persisted due to a continuation of male dominance in society and through the institution of tradition which is now so ancient that many believe it would be heresy to alter it today . It is true that the relationship that many today share with god is much better described as female , but this too stems from the feminization of 'soft ' concepts such as love and procreation . Consequently calling God male or female is 100 % related to culture and I would like to answer your question with a question . Why try to personify god as male or female ? If you follow western society 's modern beleif that male and female are equal , or the more radical belief that there is no definite male or female but shades of gender ( see transgender ) , and if gender serves the sole function of procreation through sexual intercourse why attempt to place the all powerful being that is God within the restraints of a single gender . God does not need to procreate through sexuality as God is capable of creation without thought or effort . So , why call God she ? Why not just understand that God is God regardless of name or gender .",0

"who discovered the atom ? Democritus and Leucippus , Greek philosophers in the 5th century BC , presented the first theory of atoms ( see article atomism for more details ) . The Greeks believed that atoms were all made of the same material but had different shapes and sizes , which determined the physical properties of the material . For instance , the atoms of a liquid were thought to be smooth , allowing them to slide over each other . This theory was not founded on experimental evidence.In 1808 , John Dalton proposed that an element is composed of a single , unique type of atoms , and that whilst their shape or structure was immutable , atoms of different elements could combine to form more complex structures ( compounds ) . Through his experiments , Dalton discovered the law of multiple proportions - that is , if two elements form more than one compound between them , then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers .",0

"If you wanted to come out about an work relationship , how would you do it ? Would you tell everyone in the store were you worked at or just start with a few nice people ? I do n't think I would make an official announcement . I think it 's best , in a workplace , to just continue to act professionally , as you have been , and if someone asks if you 're seeing anyone , then you can say , `` Actually , yes , I 've been seeing Roger for six months ! '' Or , if someone says , `` Hey , is there something going on between you and Roger ? '' say `` we 've been dating for six months , actually .

We want to make sure everyone 's still comfortable . '' And then continue to act that way.The reason I say not to make an official announcement is that that is the most surefire way to get everyone gossipping ( even if you do n't think they will ! ) , and looking out for drama . Rather , if you just reveal quietly when asked , it 'll seem like `` no big deal , '' or , people will realize that you 've been acting so professionally , that 's why they 're surprised !

"best way to invest money ... risks doesnt matter for me ? It 's been mathematically `` proven '' that you can get high returns AND reduce your risk by buying diverse high-risk investments which have no correllation.Also , Equities ( Stocks ) have had some of the best returns historically , and are still considered a very good investment.Of course you do n't want to be STUPID about it and buy the riskiest stuff possible . Get some AGGRESSIVE mutual funds with low fees ( Vanguard has some ) . Spread your money around to highly aggressive funds that have little correllation . For instance , some Domestic High Growth , some Foreign aggressive growth , maybe some Real Estate Trust Funds , some High Tech , Some Health Care.Look at the historic returns of the sector and the fund . Look too at the risk vs. return . If , as you say , risks do n't matter , then go for high return funds , with a reasonable risk . And spread it around - but make sure you spread it around to different TYPES of investments - all that are aggressive , but some that move contrary to each other ( like foreign vs domestic , or REITs vs Stock )",0

"A New Binary Star system ?

It can be true that if mass of Jupitor or any other planet is merged with another very huge mass to reach to required strength it may start fusion , subject it has hydrogen . The reference of Jupitor for that matter is usually to help visuallize the size of the planet .",0

Yes , I know you can but it is n't wise to do so and I 'm certainly not going to tell anyone how to do it . Second when I worked in the OIT office at my college , anyone bypassing the firewall got a 24 hour access suspension , of course that was only for the labs , dorms and public areas have full access . Because they have free spirits . Firewalls block everything except allowed ports . And if an administrator does not allow a port for Skype or for Yahoo ! Voice you will trick him .

"Where did the wedding custom of the bride wearing white come from ? The tradition of wearing white at weddings began due to the choice of colour of the wedding dress of Queen Victoria at her wedding to Prince Albert . Queen Victoria was not the first royal bride to wear a white wedding gown , but the first of the modern era . White had been a traditional colour of royal mourning , and although not often utilized as such , white was not considered a suitable choice for a royal wedding . Victoria 's choice popularized the white gown as no other had before her . Previously , brides wore their best clothes or the most expensive new clothes they could afford . Gold or gold-threaded dresses became popular with royal brides ; the rank-and-file wore dresses that reflected their station . White was one of many choices , pastel shades were also popular .",0

"what is ... ? What is Scienctology ( sp.. sorry ) I just recently heard that term used for a type of religion , I was courious to know if anyone new what it was or what it is about ... thanks Hi , here are a few detailsScientology is a system of beliefs , teachings and rituals , originally established as a secular philosophy in 1952 by science-fiction author L. Ron Hubbard , then recharacterized by him in 1953 as an `` applied religious philosophy . `` Scientology is officially represented by the controversial Church of Scientology . The Church presents itself as a non-profit religious organization dedicated to encouraging development of the human spirit . Providing counseling and rehabilitation programs , the Church offers itself as an alternative to psychiatry , which Scientologists believe to be a barbaric and corrupt profession . [ 1 ] ( http : //www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/heritage/pg011.html ) Church spokespeople attest that Hubbard 's teaching ( called `` technology '' or `` tech '' ) has freed them from drug and alcohol addictions , depression , learning disabilities , mental disorders and other problems.Scientology , however , has been the object of many allegations that sharply contradict the Church 's self-description . Critics—including officials and the courts of several countries—have characterized the Church of Scientology as an unscrupulous commercial organization ; it has often been described not as a religion , but a man-made cult that harasses its critics and exploits its members . Many of the Church 's most controversial actions are , critics argue , a direct reflection of Hubbard 's Scientology teachings.Origins of ScientologyScientology was expanded and reworked from Dianetics [ 2 ] ( http : //www.neuereligion.de/ENG/Wolf/pg6.htm ) , an earlier system of self-improvement techniques originally set out by Hubbard in the 1950 book , Dianetics : The Modern Science of Mental Health . Immediately prior to this work , Hubbard was intensively involved with the occultist Jack Parsons in performing the occult rites developed by Aleister Crowley . Some critics have seen many similarities in Hubbard 's writings to the doctrines of Crowley [ 3 ] ( http : //www.xenu.net/archive/lrhbare/lrhbare08.html ) .By the mid-1950s , Hubbard had relegated Dianetics to being a sub-study of Scientology , although it is still promoted and delivered by Scientology organizations . The chief difference between the two is that Dianetics is explicitly secular , focused on the individual 's present life and dealing with physical and mental or emotional problems , whereas Scientology adopts a more overtly religious approach [ 4 ] ( http : //victorian.fortunecity.com/finsbury/124/last.htm ) focused on dealing with spiritual issues spanning multiple past lives as well as the present day.Hubbard was repeatedly accused of adopting a religious facade for Scientology in order for the organization to maintain tax-exempt status and avoid prosecution for false medical claims ; these accusations have dogged the Church of Scientology to the present day , bolstered by numerous accounts from Hubbard 's fellow science-fiction authors that on various occasions he stated that the way to get rich was to start a religion [ 5 ] ( http : //www.bible.ca/scientology-1million-start-a-religion.htm ) .The word scientology has a history of its own . Although nowadays associated almost exclusively with Hubbard 's work , it was coined by the philologist Alan Upward in 1907 as a synonym for `` pseudoscience '' . [ 6 ] ( http : //www.instinct.org/texts/bluesky/bs3-4.htm ) In 1934 , the Argentine-German writer Anastasius Nordenholz published a book using the word positively : Scientologie , Wissenschaft von der Beschaffenheit und der Tauglichkeit des Wissens , or Scientology , Science of the Constitution and Usefulness of Knowledge . [ 7 ] ( http : //www.scientologie.de/scientologie/index.htm ) Nordenholz 's book is a study of consciousness , and its usage of the word is not greatly different from Hubbard 's definition , `` knowing how to know '' . However , it is not clear to what extent Hubbard was aware of these earlier usages . The word itself is",0

"You Think USA will attack to iran or not ? US will not dare attacking Iran . Iran is n't like Iraq and is the biggest military power in the middle east .

US knows that it has several military bases in the range of Iranian missles and in the case of this war Iran can easily hit American bases specially in Iraq . United States knows that in the case of this attack Iran is n't the loser , because the people of Iran have always supported their country in the case of a war . Iran has some close allies in Iraq , Syria , and Lebanon each one of these allies can cause big damages to the American troops.Airforce is not an option . United States ca n't attack Iran with airforce because of the new anti aircraft and missle systems Iran has bought from Russia . Nuclear War is not going to happen.But we have seen many idiotic acts from the American Govt . so anything is possible .",0

"Considering that Iran threatened Israel to wipe it from map , should Israel bring about a preemptive attack ? Iran has threatened that way for about 30 years and actually nothing has happened.There are some facts that I give you about Iran and Israel , its on you to decide:1 . Its a historical fact , Iranian King Koorosh after conquering Babylon rescued a group of Israelis that was prisoned there , his name is in Jews holy book ( the last part I have heard from a Jew friend ) 2 . Lots of famous Israel leaders born and grew up in Iran , want a sample ? Netaniaho3 . Jews live freely in Iran , no one do any harm to them , they are accepted as a god based religion and they are free to do they rituals and business , even send money to Israel if they want to , they can leave Iran and go Israel but they don't4 . Iran and Israel have n't done anything against each other , maybe cursing is the worst act5 . Although everyone think Iranian is Arabs Iranian are not arabs and they almost hate them specially because of what they have done when conquered Iran , so Iran and Israel have a common enemy6 . Israel have done anti Iraq operations many times , Iraq was Iran enemy ( they were in war for years ) 7 . Iran Nuclear program was at progress for years , Israel could do an operation when Iran was really weak ( After Iran-Iraq war exactly at the time they attack Iraq ) Maybe they yell at each others but they totally love each other ; ) Many hidden strings in Iraq and Middle east are in Iran hands , although Neo Conservatism theories which are at progress specially by UK urges that Israel needs peace and UK is the leader of Middle east politics from old times.So decide yourself , these are the facts that I know .",0

Does he mean it would be ok to have low payment if he get a job ? ③Yeah , I think I 'm gon na have to go with the second rule of horse racing . Never beat a dead horse.What is the second rule mean ? 1 . He appears to be asking the man if he needs someone to look after his horses . He is suggesting that he would like to do take this job as he is keen to get back into training horses which is what he has done before.2 . Yes . He is saying that he would be willing to accept less money than normal to do the job.3 . Beat a dead horse ( actually the real expression is - Flog a dead horse ) is an expression which means to do something which has no point because it is already settled . For example , if a child asked his mother for something and she said NO and would not change her mind , then to keep asking can be described as - Beating ( Flogging ) a dead horse . In your example it possibly is referring to the pointlessness of asking for work when none is on offer . But it is also meant to be funny in this case because the subject is actually about horses : - ) The expression probably comes from the pointlessness of beating a horse ( to make it work harder ) if it is dead ! !",0

"Why do Life Savers candy make blue sparks when you bite them ? It works the best with `` Wintogreen , '' rather than peppermint , and should be done with a fresh pack ( the moisture makes it spark better ) . The spark that comes from the Life Saver is considered as a type of triboluminescence , which the sugar in Life Savers contain . Here 's an excerpt from my source site : `` Wintergreen sparking , it 's believed , is actually a three-step process . Step One : When you shatter the sugar crystals with your teeth , electrons ( which are negatively charged ) break free . As a result , the atoms in which the electrons were formerly embedded become positively charged . In what amounts to a subatomic game of musical chairs , the free electrons dash around madly trying to find a new home . `` Step Two : Meanwhile , as the sugar crystals disintegrate , nitrogen molecules from the air attach themselves to the fractured surfaces . When the free electrons strike the nitrogen molecules , they cause the latter to emit invisible ultraviolet radiation , along with a faint visible glow . `` Step Three : The UV radiation is absorbed by the wintergreen flavoring , methyl salicylate . This then emits the fairly bright blue light you see . Pretty complicated , I admit . Clearly the planners in the Pentagon were n't the first to be obsessed with high-tech gimcracks . ''",0

To answer your original question , it is because Islam will NOT hold their fellow Muslims accountable for their actions.When asked of a Muslim , why doesn ’ t the Islamic majority in the United Nation condemn the thousands of terrorist acts perpetrated by those of your faith ? The answer comes back , “ We can not judge our Muslim brothers . Only Allah can judge them. ” Yet when it comes to judging the infidel , there are no holds barred . Now , let us contrast this attitude with what the Bible teaches.1 Corinthians 5:11-13For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside ? Do you not judge those who are inside ? But those who are outside God judges.This is the polar opposite to Islam . The Bible teaches that the Christian is to judge the actions of other Christians and call them on the carpet if they are doing ANYTHING unbiblical . However , those who are NOT believers , the Christian is to leave alone , that only GOD will judge them.So there is the contrast . If Islam was really concerned about peace , and was a peaceful religion , they would do something to stop these violent people . But do n't hold your breath .",0

"Is Scientology the biggest scam of all time ? In his own spiritual life , Tom Cruise has continued to climb the `` Bridge to Total Freedom , '' Scientology 's path to enlightenment . International Scientology News , a church magazine , reported last year that the actor had embarked on one of the highest levels of training , `` OT VII '' — for Operating Thetan VII.At these higher levels — and at a potential cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars — Scientologists learn Hubbard 's secret theory of human suffering , which he traces to a galactic battle waged 75 million years ago by an evil tyrant named Xenu.According to court documents made public by The Times in the 1980s , Hubbard espoused the belief that Xenu captured the souls , or thetans , of enemies and electronically implanted false concepts in them to keep them confused about his dirty work . The goal of these advanced courses is to become aware of the trauma and free of its effects . Is Scientology posing a real threat to Christian America or summink ? This is the third or fourth paranoid question about that organisation in a week ! If they 're crackpots let them carry on cracking pots . You can ask a similar question about Christian ( blind ) faith . How on earth does a Jewish guy being murdered by the Romans on a cross save humanity either then or now - especially as Hebrew scripture forbids ( 1 ) human sacrifice and ( 2 ) the deification of a human sacrifice ? Some Christians find the real answer to that question and carry on believing in their faith . This is because faith is often the replacement or removal of rational reasoning , facts , evidence , and logic.Why is Scientology being held up to higher standards than other blind faiths ?",0

"How can there be many ways to God ? Let not your heart be troubled : ye believe in God , believe also in me .

May God bless you all for your answers..In Jesus Most Precious Name..EyeLovesJesus For those who say there are many ways because there are so many people I respectfully disagree . The is only one God and one Way . Do most know that the early church was actually called The Way ? Why because the followed the One who said there is only One Way that being Christ . How can there be many ways when they are all so different . Some say works , some sacrafice , some even say self reliance . But consider this if God is perfect can you stand before Him ? Can you say let me in for I am a rightous man on my own certinly not . So then we need to be perfect before the Father . Can we do anything to be perfect ? Certinly not . For being a christian will not get you into heaven , on the contary being a christian will get you no where .

"Why do prisoners get to `` plea bargain '' for the crimes they chose to commit ? The way I see it , a woman does not get to say , `` Look , I really do not want to be raped , so can you just fondle me ? '' The clerk at the grocery store who is being robbed does n't get to say , `` I do n't feel like getting a serious injury or dying right now , so instead of shooting me in the chest or head , can you just shoot me in the leg ? `` So why do the criminals get to `` bargain '' and get to have the charges for the crime they committed made to be less than what they actually did ? It 's a very provocative question with a very mundane answer . I do n't think it 's fair either , but prosecutors sometimes need information about someone further up the line . If a rapist , for instance , also works with and has knowledge of a white slavery ring and can give credible testimony that will put the leaders and their underlings in jail a prosecutor may offer a lighter sentence in order to stop a larger criminal enterprise.The other reasons are more disturbing . Sometimes a prosecutor 's office is so overloaded that accepting a plea bargain is a way to make a dent in the case load that the office is carrying . Ideally , that would only occur with non-violent , first time offenders , but sadly that is not always the case.Finally , some victims are reluctant to testify or are so traumatized by the crime committed against them that they are unable to testify well and the D.A . 's office does n't want to risk an acquital . In this same vein are cases that can mount a credible reasonable doubt defense and cases where the evidence is weak or tainted.It a'int perfect , but its a better system than most others .",0

"i need to know phisical chemical properties of sodium thiocyanate ? from the link below , which includes a lot more information : Cyanic acid ( also called fulminic acid ) is an unstable ( explosive ) , poisonous , volatile , clear liquid with the structure of H-O-C=N ( the oxoacid formed from the pseudohalogen cyanide ) , which readily polymerizes to cyamelide and fulminic acid . Cyanuric acid ( also called pyrolithic acid ) , white monoclinic crystal with the structure of [ HOC ( NCOH ) 2N ] , is the compound of polymerized cyanic acid . Cyanic acid hydrolyses to ammonia and carbon dioxide in water . Its salts and esters are cyanates ( or called fulminates ) . Esters of normal cyanic acid are not known . There is another isomeric cyanic acid with the structure of H-N=C=O , which is called isocyanic acid . Its salts and esters are isocyanates . Cyanates ( or Isocyanates ) are used in the manufacturing pharmaceuticals , pesticides , textile softener , lubricants and industrial disinfectants through the conversion to polycyclic compounds ( such as hydantoins and imidazolons ) They are used as plastic additives and as heat treatment salt formulations for metals . Thiocyanate is a salt or ester of thiocyanic acid ( HSCN ) . Aqueous solutions of thiocyanic acid , also called sulfocyanic acid , are very strong acids of the equilibrium mixture of thiocyanic and isothiocyanic . Thiocyanates are bonded through the sulfur ( s ) with the structure R-S-C¡ÕN or the isomeric R-N=C=S ( isothiocyanates ) . Thiocyanates are bonded through the sulfur ( s ) which replace for the oxygen ( O ) atom . Thiocyanates are the sulfur analog of isocyanates . Organic as well as metallic thiocyanates [ CuSCN , Ca ( SCN ) 2 , NaSCN , KSCN ] are very versatile compounds . They have wide range of applications including manufacturing industrial chemicals , pharmaceuticals and pesticides . It is used in freezing solutions , fabric dyeing , electroplating , steel pickling , printing , and corrosion inhibitor against acid gases . It is used in photography industry as a stabilizer or accelerator .",0

"when was asthma first discovered ? The word asthma is derived from the Greek aazein , meaning “ sharp breath. ” The word first appears in Homer 's Iliad ; [ 2 ] Hippocrates was the first to use it in reference to the medical condition . Hippocrates thought that the spasms associated with asthma were more likely to occur in tailors , anglers , and metalworkers . Six centuries later , Galen wrote much about asthma , noting that it was caused by partial or complete bronchial obstruction . Moses Maimonides , an influential medieval rabbi , philosopher , and physician , wrote a treatise on asthma , describing its prevention , diagnosis , and treatment . [ 3 ] In the 17th century , Bernardino Ramazzini noted a connection between asthma and organic dust . The use of bronchodilators started in 1901 , but it was not until the 1960s that the inflammatory component of asthma was recognized , and anti-inflammatory medications were added to the regimen . `` It was Hippocrates ( 460-357 BC ) , the Greek physician , who first described asthma and its resulting 'spasms ' . Galen ( 130-201 BC ) , a Greco-Roman doctor , discovered that asthma was due to bronchial obstruction . He treated it with owl 's blood in wine . `` Italian physician Bernardino Ramazzini described a link between his patient 's asthma and their jobs as far back as the early 1900s . `` Until the late 1800s , the most popular method of delivering asthma medication into the lungs was smoke . `` In 1864 , Dr.Henry Hyde Salter identified animal dander as an asthma trigger . `` In 1901 , a Japanese scientist , Jokici Takamine , purifies adrenaline , found in the suprarenal glands of sheep ( discovered in 1898 ) and develops the first effective bronchodilator . `` In the 1960s , asthma researchers discovered that asthma is an inflammatory disease , not just constriction of the airways , and that asthma sufferers have a sensitive immune system which reacts to airborne allergens . The first inhaled anti-inflammatory medication is born . `` In 1972 , inhaled corticosteroids hit the market . `` - Fraser Health",0

"I need to know the physics behind a helicopter 's flight. ? I need to know how a helicopter flies ( with equations , if possible ) and the possible problems a helicopter may experience in-flight . Thanks . Well , the physics of a helicopter is a very complex subject , but in essence it is only the blades of the helicopter pushing air down on the ground to lift it . The reason it starts to become complex is because the weight of the helicopter is thrown into the equation and the blades of it work in circular motion . The helicopter does have a coefficient of friction against it , which does not help the simplicity . The blades are angled to enhance the lift momentum . they´re 3 types of blades for helicopters and planes : BLADES WITH NO ANGLE ATACK , WITH SLIGHT ANGLE ATACK AND WITH STEP ANGLE ATACK.Also the blades spin in one direction , forcing the helicopter to actually spin in the other direction : Without the rear blade the helicopter would just spin due to Newton 's third law and action-reaction forces . The third law states that `` when one object exerts a force on a second object , the second exerts a force on the first that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction '' Action-Reaction forces means that for every force that the blades exerts , the body of the helicopter will spin proportional.The Rotor , blades in the rear , keep the helicopter going straight . They always oppose the force made by the blades.IN THE SOURCE PAGE I GAVE YOU YOU´LL FIND ALL THE EQUATIONS AND ANSWERS YOU NEED ABOUT THIS TOPIC .",0
"Why are celebs / other useless people paid so much ? Something I really do n't get.Why does someone that looks good ( in the right light and make up ) but does n't have two brain cells to rub together get paid millions for a movie deal ( even if they ca n't act ) ? Why do even dumber football stars get paid even more ? Double if they 've got a paternity suit or killed someone in the past ? Why also are teachers , nurses and other public servants that actually contribute to our quality of life paid so little ? My life is richer when I 'm not watching brainless celebs and sports stars on TV and I could live my life 100 % without any of them . I would not be living my happy comfortable life , however , if it was n't for teachers / nurses and other public servants.Someone help me understand why completely useless dreggs of society get paid so much . Please . A measure of the quality of life is not confined to the 'better ' things in life.Most people feel the need to relax , have fun and dream a little . Sometimes this is a reward for having done well , for others this may be an escape from not having everything they might wish.The argument for paying celebrities / sports stars huge amounts of money is fairly simple . Put those people on the screen / field and huge numbers will pay to watch , replace them with people with 98 % of their 'talents ' and hardly anyone will watch.A teacher or nurse touches the life of hundreds of people , celebs reach tens of millions . Another thing to remember is that having money through celebrity also has a burden . First , on a personal level public adoration is like an addiction , it is very difficult to deal with 'lows ' after the 'highs ' of performing . This is a major cause of the drug dependencies found in non-sports celebs - just look at rock stars.Secondly , 'people ' extract a price for their adoration . Celebrities become public property and have little or no private life unless they are very , very lucky.No celeb ( with any future ) will complain about stuff they need to do while in their public persona . Tom Cruise is a good example - will sign every autograph request at a premiere - he arrives hours early to do so . Julia Roberts explains that she makes movies because she loves it , the $ 25 million fees are for having to put up with the massive media and public intrusion.The intrusion into stars private lives is because of the insatiable appetite that the paying public has for coverage of their favorites.Only the very few very lucky or very litigious stars have a true private life.Finally , money is only function of how much people will pay - supply and demand.If the world only had a few thousand teachers , nurses ( I hesitate at public servants ; - ) ) perhaps they would be the superstars being paid the huge amounts of money ?",0

"What is the equivalant amount of rain for every inch of snow ? It depends on the density of snow . New snowfall is typically between 7 % and 12 % of the density of water , which means 1 inch of snow is equivalent to 0.07 '' to 0.12 '' of rain ; stated another way , it takes 8 to 14 inches of snow to equal 1 inch of rain.Wind exposure often increases the density to 20 % to 30 % ( 1 inch of rain = 3 to 5 inches of snow ) . Higher density ( heavier ) snow typically results from warmer temperatures and/or winds while lower density ( lighter snow ) usually results from colder air with less wind .",0

"Should there be a law concerning credit related lawsuits ? Now that congress has passed the new bankruptcy laws that do not allow credit obligations to be totally wiped clean , this has given creditors free reign to file lawsuits for bad credit . The amount of lawsuits are jumping high as it is forcing people to file bankruptcy which under the new rules forces them to pay regardless . This use to be bad policy for creditors as it created bad business for consumers . Do creditors have right to sue consumers with money they have made off of consumers ? Should credit be regarded as an investment made by a creditor to a consumer and if that investment goes bad to not cry about it ? Are in likewise manner people allowed to sue companies and stock brokers if our investments are lost for one reason or another ? So if that can not be allowed should corporations be allowed to sue consumers for their own bad investments ? Should this be allowed or should congress amend the law to disallow lawsuits for credit obligations ? Although we may like to think better of our society , credit card companies wield a tremendous amount of lobbying power . However , can you imagine knowing that you will be exonerated from your credit obligations ; what would be the incentive to pay . The government has a difficulty time in screwing with the constitutionally protected freedom to contract , so by virtue of such they will not willingly excuse the debtor for breaching that obligation .",0

"As a Christian , how do you find balance between ... . ( see the details ) ? In my life , God has put a large number of persons in my life from a vast array of Christian Cults ... some whom I know and love very much . However , I find it very difficult to deal with this group of people . I accept people of separate belief systems without this challenge . Mostly , because Christian cults are preaching something that parallels Christian beliefs , but unfortunately is still wrong . I feel the sense of urgency to debunk what they are saying so as to prevent the young and impressionable ( in the Faith , etc ) from falling in their trap and being lost . Yet , Jesus tells us not to throw the Gospel at these people to be trampled upon . Where is the balance in this ? Anyone found a useful text or exercise on this ? Obviously Prayer and reading the Word come first ! Any particular scriptures you find helpful ? Anyone else had to deal much with these troubles ? I would love to hear from Schneb on this if anyone has him on speed dial . : -p People mean well ( though they do harm ) when they approach potential converts to Christianity by , abrasively , reminding them of their sinful standard of living.In the beginning of witnessing such 'ministering , ' my reaction was vexation of spirit because Jesus was never harsh with hurting people . The woman caught in adultery was not condemned by Jesus.When people surrounded her to carry out the brutal punishment of death by stoning , I can only imagine the fear of having a crowd of people on a mission to kill me for bad judgment ... for a bad call ... for a bad ( correctable ) choice . I can also imagine her relief to hear the noise of the crowd diminish as they listened to a lone , quiet voice of hope ( gently calling attention to their times of bad judgment ) and how they escaped punishment.True believers have to be that lone voice of hope , ( that balance ) to potential new converts subjected to the noise of those who do not minister in meekness . Paul stated in I Timothy 2:24 `` And the servant of the Lord must not strive ; but be gentle unto all men , apt to teach , patient , :25 In meekness instructing those who oppose themselves ; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth ; :26 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil , who are taken captive by him at his will . `` Therefore , as a Christian , when my thoughts lean toward harsh rebuke of those who mean well ( but do harm in their zealous ministry ) , I understand they need more instruction on how to minister in meekness . Lifting them in prayer and supplication to God ( that they become more sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit ) grants me peace from the torment of a vexed spirit .",0

"More Question to Muslim ? I am sorry this is just for My Knowladge.I do n't mean to provoke anything.Thank for a good answer.==========================What is women in Islam think about poligamy . I made some studies in Modern Muslim country it look like they do n't like poligamy.At what age Muhammad married Aishah ( Hope I am writting correctly ) and how many wife he have ? ? Why and what is the reason behind that . Dear SellCar , i really hope you got a good reason behind those questions , anyways ill answer your question.i read some strange answer above ; ( , so i hope i can make it clear Ofcourse every woman hates polygamy , God created woman to hate anyone that shares her love , but in Holy Quran it says and made it clear for men that they should not take more than one wife unless they have their reasons , like for example some wives dont have the ability to be pregnant , its no body 's fault of course but as a man everyone likes to be a father , therefore he can marry another wife.another reason for men might be that some men need more than one woman and he is not getting enough , therefore he could make sin with other woman which is bad for Islam teachings and social life and reputation , or he can marry another woman that will give him more pleasure and in the same time he is not making any sin.Moreover , if you now make a study you will find that number of men is much more less than number of women in the world , years ago in Germany they where surprised to find that 1 man is being borned for every 4 women ! ! for a reason that no one knows except God he knew that this will be the case , therefore he authorised to have more than wife , or else we will have more than half of the woman not married for the rest of their lives . ( speaking about Islam societies only , western countires men and woman stays with no marriage usually for the rest of their lives ) God authorised polygamy for more better reasons ofcourse , but i only know these.and of course there is no polygamy for men in Islam ; ) , because at that stage we cant know who is son or daughter of whom.and for a man being with a legal woman is ofcourse much better than being with a new woman everyday or month ; ( Islam makes a great social life by its teachings.============i really dont know the exact age of Muhammad ( PBUH ) when he married Aisha , but i think in 40's.God didnt authorise for muslims to marry more than four wives and in a certain conditions , but for messenger of God ( Muhmmad PBUH ) he authorised for him to marry more , i do know one reason now for this is that Mohammad ( PBUH ) wanted to make links with the arab tribes across arabia to spread Islam , and as a messenger of God marrying one of the women in a tribe it was a very good impression to make for those tribes , which later he made friendship with them and they followed Islam teachings , therefore marrying more than one wife helped the spread of Islam at that time , and it made for Islam a good base in Arabia .",0

The Patriot Act makes suspects out of honest people , and violates the rights of innocent people , the people that laws are supposed to protect . The Patriot Act is a perversion of the law . The President and all the rest of these public servants who act more like they are our rulers took an oath to uphold the Constitution , not disregard it , and not pass whatever laws they want as if the Constitution did not exist .

We 've managed to prevent some terrorist actions as a result of it ... although at the expense of diminishing the authority of the U.S. Constitution.I 'm a believer in slippery slopes so I imagine the logical end to all of this is to preempt every potentially illegal action by putting the entire population of the country into prison ... just to be on the safe side .",0

"When buying DVD Movies , what is the difference between full frame and wide screen movies ? The difference is due to something called `` aspect ratio '' . Widescreen movies have a 16:9 aspect ratio , meaning that they are more rectangular than square in the shape of the screen ( the screen is wider than regular , hence the term `` widescreen '' ) . The difference in the picture is that with widescreen , you see more on the edges of the picture . For instance , if there were 100 trees in a shot , with full frame you might only see 70 of them because the edges are cut off a bit . To me , this makes a difference in the movie , but not so much that you would have a different understanding of the film . Moving forward , I would say that you should buy your movies in 16:9 or widescreen format because more and more TV 's are now in that format .",0

"What are the differences between Communism and Socialism ? I want to know the basic differences . And please , do n't make this up . The quick 'n ' easy way to remember the difference between Socialism and Communism is : Socialism is `` from each according to their ability , to each according to their DEEDS , '' whereas Communism is `` from each according to their ability to each according to their NEEDS . '' Socialism is the stage between Capitalism and Communism . It builds upon the previous system ( Capitalism ) by nationalizing the `` means of production '' ( i.e . corporations , resources , banks , etc . ) , but not by making everyone equal . In other words , people will be paid wages based on several factors ( social need , difficulty , amount of schooling required , etc . ) , so not everyone will make the same wage -- as is often a misinterpretation of Socialism . Communism is the point where the state `` withers away . '' In other words , it 's quite a few years in the future . If I had to guess , I 'd say at least 10 generations of established Socialism has to occur before people evolve enough to realize that hurting others or the system ends up hurting themselves . As Communists we advocate Socialism because it is the next necessary step to get to Communism . In other words , it 's not that we 've given up on building a house , we just realize there is a need for a sturdy foundation first . Communists believe in human evolution . We evolve in accordance to the system we live within . Capitalism has allowed us to evolve out of our feudalistic ways ( for the most part ) , and slavery does not exist in our country anymore ( for the most part ) . But Capitalism , which is driven by the need to always increase profits , founders a `` dog eat dog '' mentality . This is not a sustainable system , either for humankind or for the environment . Under Socialism people will evolve to the point where they care about each other regardless of their location or race or whatever . If we are to survive as a species , we need to evolve . That 's one of the many reasons I 'm a Communist . Finally , one misconception people often have about Communism is that we are looking to make everyone poor . On the contrary , we want everyone to enjoy as much as possible the fruits of our vast wealth .",0

"Is it legal to publicly rate medical doctors ? In the US and other countries.e.g . could I create a web site where I say that I rate Doctor X 70/100 and Doctor Y 75/100 , without any other explanation ? What if I do provide an explanation ? What if I rated mechanics instead of medical doctors ? NOT LEGAL ADVICE : As long as you make it clear that you are offering your opinion , then your ratings will be protected by the US Constitution 's 1st Amendment protection for free speech . ( You are in the US , right ? ) If you falsely or misleadingly indicate that your rankings are based on something other than your opinion , then there may be liability for libel or even fraud . However , if the rankings are based on some criteria other than your opinion , and you are explicit about the basis for the rankings and truthful about the results , you are similarly protected . Should n't be a difference for medical or mechanical rankings . But , keep in mind that if people rely on your endorsement and then something goes wrong , they may seek to hold you liable . The best protection against this is to be explicit about your sources ( opinion , etc . ) and have a lawyer advise you.Good luck !",0

"what is an interrupt ? There is a good summary of what an interrupt is at the sources listed below . Cutting and pasting the content from one link : A signal informing a program that an event has occurred . When a program receives an interrupt signal , it takes a specified action ( which can be to ignore the signal ) . Interrupt signals can cause a program to suspend itself temporarily to service the interrupt . Interrupt signals can come from a variety of sources . For example , every keystroke generates an interrupt signal . Interrupts can also be generated by other devices , such as a printer , to indicate that some event has occurred . These are called hardware interrupts . Interrupt signals initiated by programs are called software interrupts . A software interrupt is also called a trap or an exception . PCs support 256 types of software interrupts and 15 hardware interrupts . Each type of software interrupt is associated with an interrupt handler -- a routine that takes control when the interrupt occurs . For example , when you press a key on your keyboard , this triggers a specific interrupt handler . The complete list of interrupts and associated interrupt handlers is stored in a table called the interrupt vector table , which resides in the first 1 K of addressable memory .",0

"Why is Ram for Dell computers so expensive it is called Rambus ram . ddr ram is cheap in comparison to rambus ? excerpt : Samsung Electronics , the world 's largest maker of computer memory chips , pleaded guilty Wednesday to a charge it participated in a worldwide price-fixing conspiracy that damaged competition and raised PC prices.Prosecutors said Samsung , which is based in Seoul , South Korea , and other companies conspired in e-mails , telephone calls and in-person meetings to fix the price of chips used in personal computers and other electronic devices.The outcome of the investigation also is expected to help fuel a private antitrust case filed by Rambus Inc. , which licensed a memory technology that had been embraced by Intel Corp. , the world 's largest maker of the microprocessor brains of computers.In 1996 , Intel chose Rambus technology to help speed up systems running its then-upcoming Pentium 4.But the chip makers did not want to pay Rambus royalties .

"I am preparing a speech on the importance of faith in God , can anyone tell me why they believe ? THE REASON FOR MY QUESTION IS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT GOD EXISTS , THE PROOF IS ALL AROUND US . AND YET THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO REFUSE TO GIVE GOD THE PRAISE HE DESERVES , CAN ANYONE SHARE AS TO WHY THEY BELIEVE AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO GIVE ANY TESTIMONIES YOU MAY HAVE . I AM PRESENTING A SPEECH IN MY PUBLIC SPEAKING CLASS ON HOW IMPORTANT BELIEVING GOD IS AND I WOULD LOVE TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS FROM REAL EVERYDAY PEOPLE THAT LOVE CHRIST JUST AS I DO . THANK YOU . I became a Christian when I was 14 . My grandma was living with us and had Alzheimer 's disease . There was a lot of fighting in my family . I was watching TBN and Jan Crouch invited me to give my life to Christ . She said that God wants to take me from where I am and do something amazing with my life . I just have to trust Him . So right then and there I bowed my head and asked Christ into my heart.Since then , God has done amazing things in my life . Today , I 'm a college graduate and will be pursuing a Master 's degree in Special Education . I was on my college newspaper and won a first place award in the entire state for my Opinion writing . I give all the glory to God for my accomplishments.God even rescued me from a cult . I joined a cult when I was in college , and my spirit began to cry out for God . Late at night , I went to the Christian church where I 'd been baptized originally . The ( huge ) church was completely empty as far as I could tell , but I saw a light under one door . I put my hand on the door handle , opened the door , went in and prayed with the pastor in there . After that I became active in the church again and seeing me later the pastor told me that the door I 'd walked through was acutally locked -- he checked after I left , but I 'd opened it like it was open . I know a miracle happened there and God opened the door for me.On an intellectual level , I 've come to understand that God is more real than we have ever imagined . I 've read books such as `` More than a Carpenter '' by Josh McDowell , `` The Case for Faith '' by Lee Strobel and the information on the website of the Institute for Creation Research at http : //www.icr.org As I 've gotten older I 've come to believe in God on an intellectual level as well as in my heart .",0

"what impcat of personal computers does it have on correspondence ? Personal computers introduced a more efficient form of asynchronous communication . Synchronous communication is when both parties are talking , communicating at the same time . This is like a chat room , or a telephone conversation . The difficulty that this can cause arises with the different time zones , schedule conflicts , etc.Asychronous communication is when both parties need not be present , thereby eliminating the difficulty of time zones and other scheduling difficulties . Prior to personal computers being used for correspondence , mail was used . Because of the delays between writing a message , a letter , and the recipient getting the letter , this was not very efficient . The telegraph sped up the process a bit , but could be expensive , and did not allow for long and detailed messages . Fax machines helped speed up the process , but , for a long time , you needed specialized and expensive equipment . E-mail introduced a very fast , and inexpensive , means of asynchronous communication , and because personal computers are becoming more and more common , more people are able to use the process .",0

"Is it ever okay to get a divorce in the eyes of God ? What if you married an aethiest or an agnostic ? What if your husband beats you to a pulp continuously ... and there are kids involved ? What if your husband is cheating on you ... and wo n't stop ? Are you just supposed to stick it out because of the vows you took ? ( This really is n't a personal experience question so I do n't need advice on how to go to a woman 's shelter or anything ) . Although I am answering from a Catholic perspective , the theology is fairly universal.Jesus forbade divorce , except in cases of adultery . However , a divorce also implies that there was a marriage . This tends to be the angle that the Catholic church approaches the breakdown of a legal marriage , and that is , `` was it even a marriage ? `` Marriage is , as Jesus puts it , `` when two become one flesh '' , people whom God himself has `` joined together . '' A sacramental moment of that magnitude requires that people enter it with full consent , and that consent requires both the personal maturity to give that consent as well as having all the information needed to make that consent . Take abuse , for instance - abuse implies a kind of marital fraud . Nobody would knowingly start dating someone who they knew was going to beat them , right ? An abusive person is always going to put their best foot forward at first and hide that aspect of themselves until a time when they feel safe to let it out . This is a fraud - and if a person marries such a person , they are n't doing it with that full consent of the will necessary for a marriage to truly exist.So a civil divorce may not always be a wrong thing to do , if it really is more of an annulment of a marriage that never truly was.Also - the other thing to keep in mind , is that what Jesus specifically condemned was divorce and remarriage , not divorce alone . So even if the marriage was valid in the eyes of God - i.e . abuse , lies , fraud , alcoholism were n't part of the breakdown , it was a valid marriage - it is only remarriage that he 's actually condemned.An aside : marriage was not created by the state . It long predates the state . Marriage was deeded to the state by religion ...",0

However if 60 % of all accidents that involve alcohol are caused by the sober person , if everyone quit drinking and driving if you go by the stats supplied by MADD , the amount of accidents would actually rise around 30 % . From a purely mathematical perspective , you 're right . But of course this would eliminate using the proper logic that the lack of alcohol intake makes for fewer impaired drivers that would be unable to effectively avoid an accident.Either way , do n't drink and drive ... you might spill your drink .",0

It 's less reliable than TCP , but it 's a simpler protocol and works well for the zillions of tiny packets that make up a phone call .",0

"Respiratory Therapy -- can you tell me what the job is like ? I 'm wanting to go back to school for Respiratory Therapy , but would like some input into what the job is like . I have been a registered respiratory therapist for 17 years now . The job can be very stressful depending on which type of facility that you work in . You must have a strong stomach because some of the things that we do can be quite disgusting ; such as tracheostomy care and suctioning sputum . The job can also be extremely tiring physically because of all the standing and walking within the hospital . The nursing field pays a little better . One thing that does bother me is that the nurses seem to have some direction over the therapist when it comes to the patient and sometimes try to overide our decisions . Overall , it has been a good career but I do n't think I would go back into the field again if I could do it over .",0

Just because a few in the minority feel it is `` ok '' with them , is not a reason to grant easy sentences for the illegal activity.Face it ... Pot is still illegal and until it is legalized , prison time for offenders of the written law is deserved.Prisons are over-crowded , but this is not an excuse to let people off . The prisons are over-crowded because too many in today 's society think that their opinion is greater than the masses or greater than the law .

"what etiquette , respect and rules does one need to follow as a tourist in Dubai , united Arab Emirates ? Hi - I 've only been to the airport in Duabi , but here are some pointers I found : DressAlthough the UAE is very liberal in many respects , the correct dress code is important in order not to cause offence . Conservative clothes that cover the body and limbs are preferable to casual shorts and sleeveless tops for both sexes , especially in rural areas where tradition is important.Indeed , long , loose clothing can be much cooler and more comfortable than smaller items that expose the skin to the hot sun.The Arab national dress worn in Dubai is made especially to keep the wearer cool during the hottest of weather . Men wear the kandoura or dishdasha , a white , ankle-length garment which is a loose fit and very effective in the hot and cold.Women wear an abayah , which is a black , long-sleeved , full-length robe . Both men and women wear head coverings to protect their heads and faces from the sun and windblown sand.Traditional garments are also ideal for when the temperature drops sharply at night.PhotographyNormal tourist photography is acceptable , but it is considered offensive to photograph Muslim women . It is also courteous to request permission before photographing men . Always avoid taking photographs of anything even remotely military , such as buildings , perimeter fences , vehicle convoys , checkpoints , airports and so on.TippingTipping practices are similar to most parts of the world . Where no service charge is included , 10 % is adequate.BargainingBargaining is an expected part of buying in the souk and elsewhere . Traders will usually drop their prices , often quite substantially , particularly for cash sales , but it is important to be polite at all times and not feign anger or disgust.RamadanDuring this month of fasting , pious Muslims will not eat anything during daylight hours , with most conforming to the injunctions . Foreigners are not expected to follow suit , but it is considered impolite to smoke , drink or eat in public during Ramadan . In general , I 've heard that it 's a fantastic place to go for so many reasons ! I 'm envious - have a great time .",0

"Best way to get into Voice Over work ? Where in the name of heaven do I find job postings for voice over work ? It seems to be a very insular community . Is the only `` in '' through taking high-priced classes ? Maybe I do n't know the best way , but my father is a Voice Actor , and is very successful . He offers great work shops in the L.A. area and often takes serious aspiring voice actors under his wing . I 've noticed that in his field there are some tricks . 1 . Of course you have to have a good agent . He works with a well known agency . 2 . You have to understand the trends of the business . When I was younger , he worked on a lot of cartoons like Duck Tales , Gummi Bears , Bearnstien Bears , Snorks , and a bunch of other ones . But these days , the younger voices seem to be a trend . He has had to tailor his work in a new way to get into the right realm of voice acting again . Good thing he has a great agent . 3 . This is the most important in my opinion . You have to be honest and HARD WORKING . I noticed that a lot of people in entertainment are ego-centric . They wo n't take a job unless it has a great image attached to it . When my father got his job , he took any and every job he could get . The side product was that he became extremely good at it . He has more practice than anybody , and he now bears the nick-name `` one-take Brian '' to most of his collegues in Hollywood . So when a commercial is done and they need to lay the VO tracks on the video ... he 's the man they call in crunch time because they know he 'll get it done fast . He saves sound engineers money on reduced studio time too . So I guess hard work and integrity pay off in a business where there 's a lot of less honest and less hard working people . It 's a great business and he loves it . It 's very lucrative for him too . However , I 've seen a lot of people fail at it . Get out there.. make demos , get your name known , practice your trade , and take what you can get . I hope it works out . If you live in the L.A. area and are interested in a good contact or his workshops , contact me . He has a good repetoire of well known roles and he knows most of the famous Voice Actors out there from Jim Cummings to Gary Owens .",0

"What is better NonCommissioned Officers or Commissioned Officers ? ( follow-up question.. ) It all depends on what you mean by `` better . '' The officer corps are the managers of the military and are granted that rank by the President ( at least indirectly ) . Usually they are better educated , normally requiring a college degree . Have completed some sort of military training such as Officer Candidate School , the Military Academy or ROTC . This is followed by several months , typically , of training in their branch of service . The pay for officers and the breadth of their responsibilities are normally greater than those of NCOs.If the officers are the brains of the military , NCOs are the backbone . They are more specialized in their jobs and typically have less overall responsibility . However , they have worked up through the ranks and know how things work . For this reason , they supervise soldiers on a day-to-day basis to ensure objectives of 'management ' are met . They will typically have more experience than the newly commissioned lieutenant and the wise officer will solicit their input . Personally , I had more fun and a lot less politics as an NCO.Another category , between NCO and Officer , is Warrant Officer . This is a highly specialized individual normally with expert technical skills but lacking a normal commission . Examples may include some pilots . I have n't been one of these , but that seems the way to go ; - )",0

There are several reasons why these glands ( called salivary glands ) might not work right.Some common causes of dry mouth are : * Side effects of some medicines . More than 400 medicines can cause the salivary glands to make less saliva . Medicines for high blood pressure and depression often cause dry mouth . * Disease . Some diseases affect the salivary glands . Sjögren 's Syndrome , HIV/AIDS , diabetes , and Parkinson 's disease can all cause dry mouth . * Radiation therapy . The salivary glands can be damaged if they are exposed to radiation during cancer treatment . * Chemotherapy . Drugs used to treat cancer can make saliva thicker , causing the mouth to feel dry . * Nerve damage . Injury to the head or neck can damage the nerves that tell salivary glands to make saliva .",0

"Can a state to state relationship turn in to a life long relationship together. ? Yes , it can . It depends on how hard you work at it , and how much they are working at it . You have to keep your commitments of calling when you promise , being on line when you promise , of coming down when you promise , and vice versa . Sometimes starting out in long distance relationships actually make them better . One reason is that you know from the beginning it is going to take work and are ready to take that on . Second , you learn to communicate verbally with each other on every topic , and that will last through your relationship if it leads to marriage . Also , it forces you to take things slow , and really get to know the person over time . Sometimes if we can see the person every day , we fall too fast , and fail to recognize the warning signs that we would see if there were some distance put between us . I know of a couple that dated from Scotland to Canada for two years , and just got married . You know what ? They would n't have traded the past two years for anything , because now they talk to each other every day about everything , and it has taught them a lot about confiding in each other and trusting in each other . I hope it works out for you . : )",0

"When is it morally acceptable to break the law ? I do n't want to hear never , because I believe there are some situations , such as in Nazi Germany , or early 19th century america ( slavery ) , when people have a moral right to defy the law .

I 'm not asking this because i 'm planning to revolt or think that it would be a good idea , just curious about what people think . lol . I think it is usually acceptable to break the law if , by not breaking it , someone would suffer bodily harm or death . Also , if the law is fundamentally designed to discriminate , I think that at the very least some people need to break it in order to be able to argue against it in the Supreme Court , for example when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat .",0
"how do you prevent drying/cahpping at the corner of the mouth ? Stay hydrated by drinking six to eight glasses of water daily . Use a humidifier to help add moisture to indoor air . Stop smoking , which evaporates natural oils off the lips . Cover and/or moisturize your lips to protect them from the drying effects of the wind , and don ’ t forget that your lips need sunscreen , too . Check with your pharmacist or physician about medications that can dry out your lips , particularly if you ’ re taking acne medications . Eliminate any skin care products that may be triggering an allergic reaction . Apply lip balm frequently to keep lips moist .",0
"Opinion of Marijuana v/s Alcoholic Beverages ? Should both be illegal or legal ? What are the differences to you ? Have you used both in your lifetime ? I find that alcohol seems to take whatever mood a person is in and magnify it ; so a person who is drinking in celebration becomes more exhuberant , the person who is drinking out of anger becomes more beligerant , and the person who is drinking out of depression sinks even lower . On the other hand , Marijuana typically mellows a person regardless of their mood going into it . It is common for people to become paranoid when using pot , especially with ongoing use . Both are used most often to relax and unwind ; but can become misused as a means to avoid problems . With both , the user builds a tolerance to the substance , so more and more is needed to have the desired effect with continued use . Both will alter the user 's perception and judgement.My opinion is that as long as cigarettes and alcohol are legal , there is no reason why marijuana should n't be -- it is no worse than either of those drugs . I do n't know from a medical/research standpoint , but it seems to me that alcohol is actually more harmful to the body than pot , and I believe that it is socially more harmful , because of the effects I 've observed that I noted above . If marjuana were legal , I would use it on a weekend night before watching a movie or something . In the past , I went through phases when I would smoke daily -- and it really saps motivation from a person . I used to drink , probably the most before I was of legal age . I got sick plenty of times . Now I do n't like the taste , and many alcoholic beverages actually give me a sinus/allergy attack . So it is rare for me to use either of these things now .",0

"box and whisker plots ? how do you pick out the numbers to use with a box and whisker plot when you have all the quartiles , and smallest and largest numbers ? A box-and-whisker plot can be useful for handling many data values . They allow people to explore data and to draw informal conclusions when two or more variables are present . It shows only certain statistics rather than all the data . Five-number summary is another name for the visual representations of the box-and-whisker plot . The five-number summary consists of the median , the quartiles , and the smallest and greatest values in the distribution . Immediate visuals of a box-and-whisker plot are the center , the spread , and the overall range of distribution . The first step in constructing a box-and-whisker plot is to first find the median , thelower quartile and the upper quartile of a given set of data . Example : The following set of numbers are the amount of marbles fifteen different boys own ( they are arranged from least to greatest ) .18 27 34 52 54 59 61 68 78 82 85 87 91 93 100 First find the median . The median is the value exactly in the middle of an ordered set of numbers . *68 is the medianNext , we consider only the values to the left of the median : 18 27 34 52 54 59 61 . We now find the median of this set of numbers . Remember , the median is the value exactly in the middle oa an ordered set of numbers . Thus 52 is the median of the scores less than the median of all scores , and therefore is the lower quartile.52 is the lower quartileNow consider only the values to the right of the median : 78 82 85 87 91 93 100 . We now find the median of this set of numbers . The median 87 is therefore called the upper quartile . 87 is the upper quartile ( *If you 're finding the median in an ordered set with an even number of values , you must take the average of the two middle numbers . For example : 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 . Add the two middle numbers . 5 + 7 = 12 . Divided 12 by 2 to get the average . 12 / 2 = 6 . Therefore 6 is the median for the ordered set of 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 . ) You are now ready to find the interquartile range ( IQR ) . The interquartile range is the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile . In our case the IQR = 87 - 52 = 35 . The IQR is a very useful measurement . It is useful because it is less influenced by extreme values , it limits the range to the middle 50 % of the values.35 is the interquartile rangeplease review these pages .",0

"How do you convert an annual compound return to an annual total return ? Hmm ... not sure if this question is answerable . Not sure where the term `` annual total return '' comes from . Annual compound return is really only useful if you 're talking about periods over more than a year . Assuming that you mean to compare `` total % return '' and annual compound rate , you can use : Total % Return = ( 1 + ( Annual % Rate ) ) ^ ( Years ) Assume a 5 % annual compound return , then after 10 years you would have ( 1 + .05 ) ^10 = 1.62You would have 162 % of what you started with , so if you started with $ 1 , you would have $ 1.62 .",0

"What are charter schools ? Charter schoolCharter schools are semi-autonomous nonsectarian public school choice educational alternatives that operate with freedom from many of the regulations that apply to traditional state schools . Generally they are organized by educators , parents , community groups or private organizations with an express purpose or philosophy , and controlled independent of any local school district . Charter schools are generally financed by the same per-pupil funds that traditional state schools receive.In the United States , laws governing charter schools vary from state to state . The legal charter establishing each such school is a performance contract detailing the school 's mission , program , goals , students served , methods of assessment , and ways to measure success . The length of time for which charters are granted varies , but most are granted for 3-5 years . Charter schools are accountable to their sponsor—a local school board , state education agency , university , or other entity—to produce positive academic results and adhere to the charter contract . The basic concept of charter schools is that they exercise increased autonomy in return for this accountability . They are accountable for both academic results and fiscal practices to several groups , including the sponsor that grants them , the parents who choose them , and the public that funds them . Charter schools can be closed for failing to meet the terms set forth in their charter.OverviewThe term `` charter school '' started in the U.S. , but many of the related ideas such as granting greater autonomy to local schools , independence from local school boards , and operating under a charter , have existed in and out of the U.S. for some time . Charters allow publicly funded schools to act and operate more like private schools , but still have public obligations that private schools do not have . Some charter school advocates believe that competition from charter schools provides choices to families , which will force the other public schools to perform better.The concept of public charter schools was first proposed by the Citizens League , a Minnesota political lobby group . The first charter school opened in Minnesota in 1991 , and as of the 2005-2006 school year , more than 3,600 charter schools are in operation in 40 states and the District of Columbia , enrolling more than 1 million students ( National Charter School Directory , The Center for Education Reform ) . Charter schools reflect their founders ' varied philosophies , programs , and organizational structures , and serve diverse student populations.Charter schools are commonly founded as schools for students that may not be served well by traditional public schools in their communities ( such as pregnant teens or teen parents , drop-outs , and other at-risk populations ) or those with special educational needs . Some provide a `` niche '' education , providing a strong focus on dual languages , technology , or the arts.Critics of charter schools claim they may siphon off the best students and leave regular public schools worse off . Supporters argue charter schools have been more likely to serve disadvantaged student populations . Many charter school administrators and parents argue that charter schools serve those students who are not getting their fair share at public schools . Most charter schools in big cities focus on Title I students.Opinions vary as to the success of charter schools , in part because of the philosophical outlook taken , and in part because—as may be expected—such schools vary one from another in quality , competence , and effectiveness .",0

"My cousin goes to a liberal arts school but wants to pursue marketing , what 's a good path ? My cousin is a freshman at Dartmouth and she 's expressed an interest in marketing as a career . Dartmouth does n't offer Marketing as a major so she was wondering what would be a good liberal arts degree to segue into marketing ? She 's also looking at some internships possibly after her sophomore year so any strategies for that would be welcome as well . From looking at the catalog , it seems like a combination of econ + cognitive science might be a good fit ... any thoughts ? I was in marketing for a few years , and my major in college was Communications with an emphasis in Business Administration . Many aspiring marketing people chose this major . Other relevant majors are English , Psychology , History , and Cog Sci . Whatever she takes , it will really help to minor or double-major in Business .

"How did Dinosaurs died ? So much of them around the world . How could all of them die in one sweep ? Why did all of the remaining dinosaurs die out suddenly at the end of the Cretaceous period ? There is a short answer and a long answer to this question . 2 Here is the short answer . No one knows for sure . 3 Here is the long answer . There are a number of theories . Some are scientific , and some are ridiculous . Most scientists believe in one or two main ones , but no one knows for sure . 4 The reason no one knows for sure is because the whole thing happened about 65 million years ago . No one was around to see or hear what was going on back then , and no one was around to keep records . 5 What we do know comes mainly from fossil records . Scientists study the fossils themselves , and they study the rock in which the fossils are found . Fossil records have n't given us definite proof for any one theory . This is because there are some problems with fossil records . For one thing , most fossil evidence of dinosaurs has been found in North America . We do n't know as much about dinosaur activity on other parts of the earth . Another problem is that it is very hard to date fossils . Dating fossils means determining how old they are . 6 One really interesting thing about the big dinosaur question is that scientists from many different fields are working to solve the problem . Astronomers , physicists , geologists , paleontologists , ecologists , chemists , geologists and others are all gathering evidence , experimenting , and researching to try to solve the puzzle . 7 The most popular theory is called the Alvarez Hypothesis . This hypothesis says that , 65 million years ago , a big asteroid hit the earth . This asteroid crash scattered dust high up into the atmosphere . It blocked much of the sunlight and caused the earth to become cooler . The crash also started huge fires , high winds , and violent storms that killed some of the dinosaurs . The lack of sunlight and warmth caused many plants to die . This shortage of plants for food caused the rest of the dinosaurs to die out . 8 The second most popular theory says that activity on the earth itself caused the extinction . As the supercontinent of Pangaea was breaking up , movement of the earth 's giant land plates caused volcanoes to erupt and the climate to change . These changes affected the earth 's atmosphere and temperature , and the dinosaurs died out from the cold or from lack of plants to eat . 9 Other theories suggest that dinosaurs became so big that they could n't move , or that there were too many dinosaurs and they ate up all of the food .",0

"Should the Phil . invest money donated by western countrries on developing on agri . area 's into industr'l zone ? *Economic Impact*Social and physiological needs*psychological impact*Advantage and disadvantage Investing money to develop agricultural areas into industrial zones is good -- -partly though.First of all , the Philippines is an agricultural nation . Perhaps some agricultural areas should be developed , but not all . Since it is an agricultural nation , it derives its economy from agriculture . If these areas will be developed into industrial zones , a good part of the economy will be crippled.Second , people who depend on agriculture for a living will lost their jobs . If their skills are only limited to agriculture , where will they go once these areas are industrialized ? Lastly , and this is just my opinion , if agricultural areas will be turned into industrial zones , and considering that the money comes from Western countries , the Philippines will then have a debt of gratitude to these nations . Meaning , its government will do whatever these nations will tell them to do . Another form of colonization , eh ? Industrialization is not bad as long as it is done with responsibility -- -which I doubt the Philippine government has . Yeah , I am disillusioned . I 'm a Filipino too .",0

"What is a good start for a man over 40 , weight traning and cardio plan ? I am in fairly good shape . Matt , I would recommend that you start with a check-up with your doctor , just to make sure you are in otherwise good shape . Having done this you are good to go . Although not widely known , weight lifters normally have better cardio systems than runners , just not the lung capacity . At 40 , I would recommend starting with a moderate weight lifting routine on machines . Later you can switch to free weights as you get stronger . Free weights are better in some respect in that you have to control the weights . However , most modern machine weights are designed to give you a workout throughout the complete range of motion . Make sure you get plenty of rest between reps and do n't over do it to start with . Also add moderate stretching and decent nutrition . You do n't have to give up all good foods , because as you add muscle your body will consume more calories , even at rest . Sometimes the muscle aches caused by the minor tears in the muscle during working out do n't appear for 48 hours . The tears rebuild and realign into stronger muscle tissue . Take your time . Normally about 3 weeks of moderate weight lifting will begin to show results . A little weight gain can be expected if you are n't also dieting , but the weight gain does not mean size gain . Muscle is denser , so a pound of muscle is not as big as a pound of fat . Good luck ole boy and welcome to the over 40 club . By the way . Since I turned 40 I have dated women ranging in age from 19 to 56 , so if you are n't married , it 's a whole new world out there .",0

"Does anyone know anything about Linus Pauling any written work ? ? ? Pauling , Linus Carl ( 1901-1994 ) , American chemist and physicist , whose investigations into the structure of molecules led to discoveries of how chemicals bond.Pauling was born in Portland , Oregon , on February 28 , 1901 , and educated at Oregon State College and the California Institute of Technology . He began to apply his insights into quantum physics as Professor of Chemistry at the institute , where from 1927 to 1964 he made many of his discoveries . By devising techniques such as X-ray and electron diffraction , he was able to calculate interatomic distances and the angles between chemical bonds.During the 1930s Pauling introduced concepts that helped reveal the bonding forces of molecules . The Nature of the Chemical Bond , the result of these investigations , has been a major influence on scientific thinking since it was published in 1939 . Pauling also investigated the atomic structure of proteins , including haemoglobin , and discovered that cell deformity in sickle-cell anaemia is caused by a genetic defect that influences the production of haemoglobin . He was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work . In later years Pauling fought ardently against nuclear weapons testing , warning the public of the biological dangers of radioactive fallout , and presented a petition to the United Nations in 1958 signed by over 11,000 other scientists . In 1962 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , becoming the second person , after Marie Curie , to win two Nobel Prizes.Throughout his scientific career , Pauling followed his creative hunches , no matter how controversial they were . In 1970 , for example , he advocated large doses of vitamin C to treat the common cold—a belief , however , that few medical authorities have endorsed .",0

"how do I date a woman and make her feel confortable with me ? As to how you date , it depends on your culture . In the US , you ask her to go to dinner and a movie . Meet her parents , make polite conversation for 5 - 10 minutes , tell them when you will be home.Feeling comfortable is a matter of not pushing . Do n't try to [ hold hands / kiss / have sex ] on the first night , for instance , again depending on your culture . Ask her about her interests instead of talking about yours.Depending on your age and experience , she will probably be as nervous or not nervous as you . Two 16-year olds are ALWAYS nervous .

"why are you a Christian ? honestly I was introduced to Christianity growing up , but that is n't why I 'm Christian . It is very obvious to me that someone had to create the world and universe . So many wonderful miraculous things happen to people that can not be explained by logic , or natural order . Even the complexity of natural order is too vast to be by impossible chance . This led me to know that there is a Supreme Being.As for why Christianity , there are a couple of reasons . The Bible has never been proven inacurate , which supports the fact that it is divinely inspired . Some good/interesting books about this topic are written by Lee Strobel `` The Case for Christ '' `` The Case for a Creator '' and a couple more . Even when the Bible has n't been believed , someone has come across ruins that disproves man 's theory , and inforces that the Bible is right . Creation interpretation of data makes sense to me , and having the world be ~6000 years old gets rid of lots of problems ( like there should be billions more people on the earth if it has been around for millions of years , the fact that trees that are buried in layers supposedly thousands of years apart should have rotted , not nearly enough fossils- let alone NONE that are inbetweens , etc ) . These are physical external reasons to me.There is also a much more important internal aspect to why I allow Christ to rule my life . Reading His Word , applying His principles ( which never contradict each other ) , and knowing that someone always loves me no matter how much I screw up has made a difference in my life . This change is so real that I can be certain of God , His Son , and the Holy Spirit . I now never have that 'does anybody care ? ' empty feeling , or the 'why am I even here/what is the point of existance ? ' attitude . This does not mean that I have the perfect life , and all is sunshine . I sometimes have down days , I still get frusterated at times and ask why , but there is always an instruction manual to go to , and He is always with me . That is a very comforting thought , that the God of the entire universe specifically loves me , cares about me , listens to me whenever I take the time to talk with Him , and can change my attitudes and bless me . How wonderful !",0

"How to Exercise without Losing Breast Fat ? Is there anyway you can workout and tone your body without losing your breasts ? There is no such thing as spot toning , it is a fitness myth . Any reduction in fat will result in a slight loss from all parts of the body . As humans we tend to gain weight from the center out , thus you generally notice weightloss in the face first .

"what is human relation in business psychology ? The human relations movement was initiated by psychologists and employment experts in the United States in the 1920s . The movement viewed workers in terms of their psychology and fit with companies , rather than as interchangeable parts.This view was advanced in reaction to the efficiency focus of Taylorism in the early 1900s . Though human resources have been part of business and organisations since the first days of agriculture , the modern concept of human resources was codified by advocates of a human relations view.This movement grew throughout the middle of the 20th century , placing emphasis on how leadership , cohesion , and loyalty played important roles in organizational success , and on the value of participatory management . Although this view was increasingly challenged by more quantitatively rigorous and less `` soft '' management techniques in the 1960s and beyond , human resources had gained a permanent role within the firm .",0

"pls give at least thing that the sun can do to all living things . and what is the importance of sunlight ? The sun provides energy to living organisms of the Earth . There are autrophs and heterotrophs . Autotrophs ( like plants ) use sunlight to turn CO2 and Water , which can not be further oxidized as fuel into GLucose , which can be burned by a cell as a source of fuel . Low rung food chain heterotrophs eat autotrophs ( these are herbivores ) and get their calories ( food is a source of chemical potential energy ) from the glucose ( and some other chemicals ) made by autotrophs . Higher level heterotrophs eat the lower level heterotrophs , getting their calories from proteins and fats of the herbivores they are eating . The calories contained in the proteins and fats of the herbivores is derived from the calories of the autotrophs . In essence , the calories from food on this planet are derived from energy from sunlight that plants have converted to chemical form .",0

"What should I eat or not eat to help prevent a herpes outbreak ? Lysine is one of numerous amino acids that the body needs for growth and tissue repair . It is classified as one of the nine `` essential '' amino acids because you need to get it from outside sources such as foods or supplements -- in other words the body ca n't make it on its own . Researchers are exploring the value of lysine supplementation and the consumption of lysine-rich foods for lowering cholesterol , improving athletic performance , and enhancing recovery after surgery.Some nutritionally oriented physicians and dentists recommend taking lysine during an outbreak of canker sores to speed healing . The exact cause of these tiny but quite painful mouth ulcers is unclear , but most research indicates that a virus is responsible . However , there have been almost no clinical trials using lysine as a remedy for canker sores.The most promising application of lysine is its use in managing and preventing painful and unsightly herpes sores caused by the herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) .Specifically , lysine may help to : # Prevent and relieve cold sores ( herpes ) . Exciting research over the past several decades suggests that lysine may be helpful in controlling herpes simplex-related infections . There are two types of this virus : type 1 , which typically causes cold sores or fever blisters around the mouth , and type 2 , which tends to cause genital sores . However , both forms can cause eruptions around the mouth or on the genitals . Once infected with the virus , you have it permanently . It may lie dormant , but it does n't go away . Outbreaks are usually painful and unsightly , as well as contagious.A few years ago , researchers discovered that in order to grow ( replicate ) , the herpes virus needs arginine , another common amino acid . ( Foods high in arginine include chocolate , peanuts , almonds , seeds , cereal grains , gelatin , and raisins . ) Lysine competes with arginine for absorption and entry into tissue cells . And when lysine is present , it inhibits the growth of HSV by knocking out arginine.This makes a diet high in lysine and low in arginine a useful tool in managing HSV infections . In a recent study , participants consumed large amounts of lysine ( about 1 gram three times each day ) while restricting food sources of arginine . A significant number of participants ( 74 % ) noticed an improvement in their HSV infections and a decrease in the number of outbreaks.-As a side note , broccoli is also one of the better vegetable to help your body in keeping outbreaks at bay .",0

"information about light ? Light , form of electromagnetic radiation similar to radiant heat , radio waves , and X rays . Light consists of extremely fast oscillations of an electromagnetic field in a particular range of frequencies that can be detected by the human eye . Different colour sensations are produced by light vibrating at different frequencies , ranging from about 4 × 1014 vibrations per second for red light to about 7.5 × 1014 vibrations per second for violet light . The visible spectrum of light is usually defined by its wavelength , ranging from the smallest visible wavelength for violet , about 40 millionths of a centimetre ( 16 millionths of an inch ) , to 75 millionths of a centimetre ( about 30 millionths of an inch ) for red . Higher frequencies , corresponding to shorter wavelengths , comprise ultraviolet radiation , and still higher frequencies are associated with X-rays . Lower frequencies , which are at longer wavelengths , are called infrared radiation , and still lower frequencies are characteristic of radio waves . Most light comes from electrons that vibrate at these high frequencies when heated to a high temperature . The higher the temperature , the greater the frequency of vibration and the bluer the light produced.Light is emitted from a source in straight lines and spreads out over a larger and larger area as it travels ; the light per unit area diminishes as the square of the distance . When light strikes an object , it is either absorbed or reflected ; light reflected from a rough surface is scattered in all directions . Some frequencies are reflected more strongly than others , and this gives objects their characteristic colour . White surfaces scatter light of all wavelengths equally , and black surfaces absorb nearly all light . Image-forming reflection , on the other hand , requires a highly polished surface such as that of a mirror.Defining the nature of light has always been a fundamental problem in physics . The English mathematician and physicist Sir Isaac Newton described light as an emission of particles , and the Dutch astronomer , mathematician , and physicist Christiaan Huygens developed the theory that light travels by a wave motion.It is now believed that these two theories are essentially complementary , and the development of quantum theory has led to the recognition that in some experiments light acts like a series of particles and in other experiments it acts like a wave . In those situations in which it travels in wave motion , the wave vibrates at right angles to the direction of travel ; therefore light can be polarized in two mutually perpendicular planes ( see Optics ) .III VELOCITY The speed of light was first measured in a laboratory experiment by the French physicist Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau , although earlier astronomical observations had yielded approximately the right velocity . By the 1970s the speed of light had been measured very precisely as 299,792,458 m/sec ( 186,282.397 mi/sec ) in a vacuum , and could be used to measure large distances by the time it took for a pulse of light or radio waves to reach a target and return . This is the principle of radar and sonar . Accurate knowledge of the speed and the wavelength of light also permits accurate measurement of length . In fact , in 1983 the metre was redefined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second . The velocity of light in air varies slightly with wavelength , averaging about 3 per cent less than in vacuum ; the speed in water is about 25 per cent less , and in glass , 33 per cent less.Light has an important effect on many chemicals . Sunlight , for example , is used by plants to carry out photosynthesis , and the exposure of certain silver-containing chemicals to light causes them to turn dark in the presence of other chemicals , as is the case in photography .",0
"why is there no light in space ? There is light in space . After all , the light we see on Earth from the Sun , the moon , and the stars travels through space to get here . The big difference between Earth and space is that our atmosphere reflects the light that goes through it . So it makes our surroundings seem brighter . Since space does n't hold an atmosphere there is nothing to reflect the light and it just passes through.So basically light is always travelling through space but it does n't get reflected ( which makes it dark ) .Hope that makes some sense .",0

Each core runs at 2.0GHz , which is the same speed as the 90 nanometer process Athlon 64 3200+.For about the same price , the best single core processor is the Athlon 64 4000+ , with the San Diego core . It has 1MB of L2 cache . This is likely a better gaming processor than the X2 3800+ , because it has has a 400MHz speed advantage in one thread . It also has a 1MB L2 cache.Currently , all mainstream games are single threaded , meaning that they ca n't utilize the capabilities that dual core processors have . The dual core processor will perform very nicely in the environment of your operating system , but it wo n't have an advantage in gaming . Most people predict that multi-threaded PC games will become more common in the next few years , but there is a good chance they will do nicely on older single threaded systems at lower speeds.When it comes to games , your graphics card is far more important than the speed of your processor . Normal multitasking benefits most from the processor.Overall , I would recommend the Athlon 64 X2 3800+ .",0

"How to deal with my 10 yrs old daughter that is always late and seems she does n't understand that time goes by Some people do not have good concepts of time regardless of what others tell them . It might be in part due to ADD or some other cognitive issue or that they might become so present in each moment that they are unable to think about anything else mundane and necessary such as time and that they have to conform to it 's limits . ADD can have bizarre opposites like not being aware of or focused enough to notice something like time , but then being so focused on what you 're doing that you are unaware of time ... Contrary but it occurs . But please do n't rush to drugs if you find they have ADD . Drugs are n't always the answer and can have horrible side effects , ritalin is just pharmaceutical speed . Awareness and education and remaining involved in an activity they love is the best bet for ADD-like issues.Talk to her nicely about it . Explain that unfortunately in this modern world , one we do n't have much of a choice about living in unless we want to live in the woods , have to conform to a little to be able to get along and function well in . Help her understand what the consequences of time management are about and the downfalls of it to herself and to others . Nicely of course . No pressure but engage her conscience so that she feels responsible for the affect she has upon another person when she is late . You can also enlist tools such as a large clock that she can understand with hands/dials or digital numbers . Help her practice what time she begins something , how long she will be at it and then when she will stop that activity to begin another ... etc . Or a timer that she can set for a distinct amount of time so that when it goes off she knows she has something she has to get ready for next and allows her time to plan . Ask her what her beliefs are about time and her responsibility to others is in regards to being on time . Ask her what 's going on , engage her opinion even if she has to figure it out as you go . It will help her become conscious of the situation beyond your frustration and into her role in it.Look into different methods in the educational department or section for kids with learning disabilities ( even if she does n't have one ) . The resources are good and you can use them to your advantage , like I said even if she does n't have one . Good luck !",0

"How 's apoptosis related to the development of the fingers ? the way apoptosis make the fingers form ( scroll to `` > > > > > > '' ) For every cell , there is a time to live and a time to die . There are two ways in which cells die : They are killed by injurious agents . They are induced to commit suicide.Death by injuryCells that are damaged by injury , such as by mechanical damage exposure to toxic chemicalsundergo a characteristic series of changes : They ( and their organelles like mitochondria ) swell ( because the ability of the plasma membrane to control the passage of ions and water is disrupted ) . The cell contents leak out , leading to inflammation of surrounding tissues.Death by suicideCells that are induced to commit suicide : shrink ; develop bubble-like blebs on their surface ; have the chromatin ( DNA and protein ) in their nucleus degraded ; have their mitochondria break down with the release of cytochrome c ; break into small , membrane-wrapped , fragments . The phospholipid phosphatidylserine , which is normally hidden within the plasma membrane , is exposed on the surface . This is bound by receptors on phagocytic cells like macrophages and dendritic cells which then engulf the cell fragments . The phagocytic cells secrete cytokines that inhibit inflammation ( e.g. , IL-10 and TGF-β ) The pattern of events in death by suicide is so orderly that the process is often called programmed cell death or PCD . The cellular machinery of programmed cell death turns out to be as intrinsic to the cell as , say , mitosis . Programmed cell death is also called apoptosis.1 . Programmed cell death is as needed for proper development as mitosis is . Examples : The resorption of the tadpole tail at the time of its metamorphosis into a frog occurs by apoptosis . > > > > > > > > The formation of the fingers and toes of the fetus requires the removal , by apoptosis , of the tissue between them . The sloughing off of the inner lining of the uterus ( the endometrium ) at the start of menstruation occurs by apoptosis . The formation of the proper connections ( synapses ) between neurons in the brain requires that surplus cells be eliminated by apoptosis",0

"how does computer work ? A computer is an information-processing machine that works by converting all kinds of information into binary numbers ( ones and zeros ) and then using simple mathematics to make decisions about , or to rearrange , those numbers . There are two things essential to understanding the basics of how a computer works . One is that a computer treats any type of information ( not only numbers but also letters , words , dates , and so on ) as if it consisted simply of binary ones and zeros . For example , a computer can translate the letter “ A ” typed into its keyboard into a string of ones and zeros , such as 1000001 . One reason to do this is that once in binary form , the information can be stored and moved about more easily .",0

I 've been searching all over , but the websites i find are always using terms and acronyms that i 'm not sure i know the meaning of . can someone help me out ? I agree with VaTreasures - the best thing you can do when using a credit card is to discipline yourself to pay off your balance on time . If you get into a habit of not paying on time you start to acrue more and more interest fees ( I know all about it ) . Paying back on time will also avoid any missed payment penalties.Apply for a credit card with an interest free period , this will cut down on costs . Getting an interest free period is important.If you are unhappy with the idea of running a credit account , then I would recommend a prepaid card or direct debit card . Prepaid cards can be loaded with funds so you can not overspend , which keeps your finances in good shape . Debit cards withdraw funds from your bank account instantly when you make a purchase , again these do not require managing a credit account and help discipline your spending.More helpful tips from round the web :",0

"Can you ever win an argument with an athiest ? It depends on what the exchange is addressing.If you are attempting to convince an Atheist as to the validity of religion or faith , then likely not . That would be particularly true with an Atheist who stands on a foundation of Determinism.Any other subject would be fair game and most Atheists I know are open to new knowledge and more then willing to develop new conclusions , but you will have to present arguments bast on solid provable facts.By the way , I have been a Deterministic Atheist for nearly 50 years .",0

"On my mobo I have a 4pin power plug and a 20pin power plug , which do I use ? My 450watt PSU has the 4pin plug for the motherboard but does not have the 20pin . It does have a 24pin though which I can not figure out what it goes on.Any suggestions ? Do I NEED both of them or just the 4pin ? You do need both . The power supply you have is a later version of the ATX form factor . Basically , your power supply has more pins because it 's made with the later standard . Your motherboard is probably fairly old and/or basic . In any case , you should be able to plug the 24-pin plug into the the 20-pin socket without a problem ( it should only fit one way ) . If you do n't feel comfortable doing this , there are adapters available . Here is a link to buy one : http : //www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp ? Item=N82E16812101122",0

Oh , and if you go out with each other is there so way we can be freinds afterwards ? ! Sticky situation . But u have to decide whether u would want her to be your Girlfriend or just a 'Friend ' . u have something to lose both ways . If she accepts you will gain a Girlfriend but will lose a friend ( confusing as it seems , its true ; somehow girlfriends are not like ur friends , believe me I know ! ) and if u do n't u will feel having lost out on a important and beautiful relationship . Or even otherwise it could all go down.If u do want to tell her , take her out on a walk/stroll around the neighbourhood/park/whatever and tell her about ur feelings in straight terms , use something romantic if u have to . Do whatever , but do n't come on too strong , otherwise she 'll do a rethink . And do it before the other guy does !

"When someone treats you bad , can they still love you ? Read the details. ? Even though someone treats you bad , can they still love you ? Can you still love them because you have fooled yourself into believing it ? If so , how do you `` unfool '' yourself ? I see mostly women answering this one , so here 's my take : There is always going to be somebody else that is better . These sort of things happens to guys as well ... I am one of those guys , and I left when it got bad . Bad enough that she decides to call the cops on me when I broke up with her , purposely made a few marks on herself , and I do an over-nighter . That was 5 years ago . Now I finished school ( college ) and got an awesome job , now I need someone to share my new life with , and I know she is out there . Bottom line is this : You can do just fine w/o the abuse , probably better ... and when you find yourself where you want to be in life , try again ! Best wishes to ya !",0

"what is `` strain ? '' ? Strain describes the % change in length of an object in the same direction of the load . Strain is almost always used with the word stress which is the reason there is strain . Stress is a force distributed over an area . If you take a 1/2 '' diameter steel pin and it is 1 '' long and you put 100 lbs on one end and the other end on the ground , you put 100lbs/.20in*in or 500 psi into the pin . Now visualize the pin being crushed under this load . The 1 '' distance between the end faces is no longer 1 '' . Say a measurement shows that under this load the pin is 0.998 '' . The strain , measured in inches per inch , is the change .002 '' divided by the length . In this case .002/1=.002 inches per inch . So the strain would be .002 in/in . ( In real life , the strain from a 100 lb load on a steel 1/2 '' pin would be very difficult to measure . ) See Poisson 's ratio which specifically deals with the different strain rates based on material properties .",0

"What if you are wrong ? Like the song says , What if you are wrong and Christ is the son of God who has died for you and is the only way to the Father . Are you be willing to take that risk without at least searching for the truth ? Is your eternity worth looking into ? But I am not wrong , unless you think the Bible is wrong ! And if the Bible is not wrong , then you should examine your beliefs , and you will come to the conclusion you should convert to Judaism.The place i look to see what i should believe , and to check against to see if other beliefs are wrong is the Bible , the Hebrew Scriptures , and when i check i check in the original Hebrew.Here is what it says , in contrast to Christianity : : : The Christian understanding is that the Messiah , Jesus , died for the sins of the people . The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin.But we are taught in our Torah that no one can die for the sins of another . In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death forthe fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin ( eesh b'chet-o yumatu ) .In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself to atone for the sins of the people . To be written out of Gd 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . Gd 's response is No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : Exodus 32:30-35 And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Etrnl ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Etrnl , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Etrnl said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book . The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for Gd 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd will forgive us.So , the Bible is clear , no one can die for the sins of another , and this means that Jesus can not die for anyone else 's sins.Christians also believe that one needs a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin , that one who does not have such a blood sacrifice will die in their sins , and go to hell , except for the sacrifice of Jesus.This , too , is UnBiblical . The Bible describes blood sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin in the Book of Leviticus . But it is in Leviticus itself , in the middle of the discussion of the sin sacrifices , that we are taught that we do not need a blood sacrifice to be forgiven for our sins . Offering a blood sacrifice was an expensive thing to do for the family offering the animal . Was forgiveness then , to be only for the rich ? No , because if one could not afford a blood sacrifice then one who sins could bring flour , which has no blood and no life as their sacrifice , and Gd forgave them ! Leviticus 5:11-13 ; But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering ; he shall put no oil upon it , neither shall he put any frankincense thereon : for it is a sin offering.Furthermore , read the Book of Jonah . In Jonah , the People of Ninevah do three things in order to be forgiven by Gd . They fast , they pray for forgiveness , and they stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgave them ! This is exactly what we do on Yom Kippur , we fast , we pray for forgiveness , and , hopefully , we stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgives us . And what book do we read on Yom Kippur afternoon ? The Book of Jonah ! Jonah 3:7-10 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Ninevah , by the decree of the King and his noble",0
"Why is this Alito guy such big news ? I 've been reading about this Alito guy but I do n't understand why is such big news . From what I understand he 's being interviewed for Judge of the Supreme Court . Is there a piece of information I 've missed ? Why is that such big news ? It just seems like a regular political process . It is a regular political process . True , the parties are bickering as usual , but there has always been controversy surrounding new Supreme Court justices . If everyone 's political party was swiched ( Bush would become a Democrat , for example ) , the exact same ranker would be going on . Justices are the top echelon of the legal system , so they are very important . Also , they are appointed for life , so you had better make sure you 're picking the right guy . Unfortunately , Mr. Alito is being confirmed during a particularly nasty period of political polarization , so many of the questions and issues are n't real questions , they 're sensationalist propaganda from both sides of the isle . In case you missed the memo , abortion is NOT the only legal question of the day , yet that seems to be what most of the fuss is about . Lastly , since they are appointed for life , this man has the potential power to influence American jurisprudential thought for perhaps the next 30 or 40 years . Needless to say , he 'll be making rulings long after Bush is gone , and the next guy , and the next guy . He 'll also survive Republicans losing their majority in Congress , then gaining it , then losing it , etc . So essentially , theres a big fuss because they are getting ready to install someone who is going to effecting law ( and by extention politics ) for many years to come . I personally think the Court will be fine with Alito because , unlike the talking heads on CNN and FoxNews who seem fixated on abortion and other trivial matters , I 've been watching the hearings live and reading the transcripts ( I 'm a law student ) , and he actually seems less polarizingly conservative and more qualified than even Republicans are admitting to .",0

First , we dont call out Bible the 'Old Testament ' because we dont believe there is a new one.However , yes , the Orthodox Jewish community still follows the laws you describe above.By the way , this means that for roughly 2 weeks each month , a Jewish couple who follow this law will not have sex as an issue between them . It means that for half of each month , they must relate to each other as platonic friends , and this makes the relationship far stronger , and is one reason given for the very low divorce rate throughout the history of the Jewish People .

"Why do people have five fingers instead of six or seven ?

Yet { some early vertebrates ] had 7 toes ... .8 toes ... .6 toes . ... My tentative guess is thatin those early times the different species really did benefit from their respective numbers of toes ... Later the tetrapod limb design hardened at 5 digits because some internal embryonic process came to rely upon that number .

"who killed fernand magellan ? Death of MagellanHeading northwest , the crew reached the equator on 13 February 1521 . On 6 March , they reached the Marianas and on 16 March , the island of Homonhon in the Philippines , with 150 crewmen left . Magellan was able to communicate with the native peoples because his Malay interpreter could understand their language . They traded gifts with Rajah Kolambu of Limasawa , who guided them to Cebu , on April 7 . Rajah Humabon of Cebu was friendly to them , and even agreed to accept Christianity.The initial peace with the Philippine natives proved misleading . Magellan was killed in the Battle of Mactan , against indigenous forces led by Lapu-Lapu , on April 27 , 1521 . Antonio Pigafetta , a wealthy tourist who paid to be on the Magellan voyage , provided the only extant eyewitness account of the events culminating in Magellan 's death , as follows : Monument in Lapu-Lapu City that marks the site where Magellan was purportedly killed '' When morning came , forty-nine of us leaped into the water up to our thighs , and walked through water for more than two cross-bow flights before we could reach the shore . The boats could not approach nearer because of certain rocks in the water . The other eleven men remained behind to guard the boats . When we reached land , [ the natives ] had formed in three divisions to the number of more than one thousand five hundred persons . When they saw us , they charged down upon us with exceeding loud cries ... The musketeers and crossbow-men shot from a distance for about a half-hour , but uselessly ... Recognizing the captain , so many turned upon him that they knocked his helmet off his head twice ... An Indian hurled a bamboo spear into the captain 's face , but the latter immediately killed him with his lance , which he left in the Indian 's body . Then , trying to lay hand on sword , he could draw it out but halfway , because he had been wounded in the arm with a bamboo spear . When the natives saw that , they all hurled themselves upon him . One of them wounded him on the left leg with a large cutlass , which resembles a scimitar , only being larger . That caused the captain to fall face downward , when immediately they rushed upon him with iron and bamboo spears and with their cutlasses , until they killed our mirror , our light , our comfort , and our true guide . When they wounded him , he turned back many times to see whether we were all in the boats . Thereupon , beholding him dead , we , wounded , retreated , as best we could , to the boats , which were already pulling off .

"why do farts smell ? So why do farts smell ? Fermented food produces different types of fumes , some of which smell . Flatulence contains odorless gases , such as nitrogen , carbon dioxide , oxygen , and methane , but it also contains the `` oh-so-nasty '' hydrogen sulfide , which causes the smell . If you have not noticed by now , some of the aforementioned fumes are flammable , like methane and oxygen , so you can , in fact , burn farts . Yes , you can set them aflame ; it is not a myth.How much odor is produced also depends on the food you eat . Vegetarians might fart as often as meat-eaters , but their farts do not smell as much because vegetables produce less hydrogen sulfide . The more sulfur rich the foods you eat , the more your farts will stink because bacteria will generate sulfides and mercaptans as they break down the nutrients . Beware : even though cauliflower is a vegetable , it also makes you stinky , so watch out !",0

"How can I start a prison ministry in my church and have it remain safe for children ? Your church should already have guidelines of who should be allowed to be near the children .

Also , Jerry was said to have attended many NLCR shows in Cali . In David Dodd 's book , there is a semi-confirmation of this theory from Robert Hunter .",0

"How can we use a robot to sew something ? Visit website addressed below : www.ingora.com `` Robot '' comes from Czech robota meaning compulsory service , work ( Webster ) . Now it means any automatic device that performs functions ordinarily ascribed to human beings , or operates with seemingly human intelligence .

"how do you get rid of pregnancy nausea ? Cinnamon tea , an old herbal remedy may help and it does not cost much to try it if you like and can drink cinnamon tea . Steep 2 � tablespoon cinnamon bark or powder in boiling water for ten minutes . Strain , add honey to taste and drink � cup three times a day before meals . You may also buy herbal cinnamon tea bags available at most supermarket.Pregnancy is such an exciting time in life , but for some it is marred by the discomfort of morning sickness or nausea . This is most unpleasant at best and if severe , dehydration can cause multiple problems . None of this is necessary as there is an effective way to relieve the nausea with Myofascial Trigger Point Therapy ( Applied pressure to trigger points in a muscle area ) .Although it has not been proven , the ongoing theory is that hormonal changes trigger spasm in the Pyloric Sphincter ( the muscle surrounding the opening that leaves the stomach ) . Because Myofascial Trigger Point Therapy can relieve muscle spasms of all sorts , it can also relieve the Pyloric Sphincter spasm causing morning sickness , known in the medical field as Hyperemesis Gravidarum . The nausea can start about the 4th week of pregnancy up until the 12th week and for some into the 2nd trimester.However , I have discovered an easy method to eliminate morning sickness . During this stage , the trigger points in the Pyloric Sphincter area are very tender , usually painful and just too uncomfortable to put pressure on one self ; therefore you will need a friend or your husband to help you . You may feel nauseated right afterwards but do not feel discouraged there will be relief a bit later . You may need to repeat this every 3 hours if the nausea returns . If the trigger points are too tender to repeat every 3 hours , repeat every 6 hours . This way you can at least get some food and fluids down to maintain good nutrition.If the nausea is severe , try eating only food , ( omitting liquids ) at meal times and take your fluids between meals . Milk just brought to the boil and then refrigerated is quite pleasant and a good food source.Let me explain why it works and how I discovered it . I am a Registered Nurse and have worked many years in the anti-partum unit at a good size hospital in Orange County . This unit treats patients with difficult pregnancies . One of the common problems is dehydration due to severe nausea called Hyperemesis Gravidarum . Most doctors prescribe intravenous fluids and medication for nausea . This does not always work and the nausea and vomiting often continues which puts the patient in a starvation situation forcing the treating doctor to order Hyper alimentation fluid . A complete nutritional fluid given intravenously that costs approximately $ 500 a bag and is given over a twenty-four hour period . The patient is still nauseated and vomiting but is fed nutritionally and may need this feeding for 2 to 3 weeks and sometimes more.Now I found that if I used an easy method of helping the pregnant mom and taught her husband how to help his wife , when she was first admitted and given some intravenous fluid she would go home in a day or two . However if I was not on duty and and the patient had been started on the Hyper alimentation fluid , my method did not seem effective . The patient would still suffer nausea although she would receive adequate nutrition.So if you are pregnant , fear nausea and want to make sure you feel good all the time and not have to go through all this hospital suffering , you may want to print this health tip . Have your husband help with the procedure even before you experience nausea , just as a preventative measure.NOTE : This procedure may also bring some very quick relief from gastric problems when they are caused by spasm of the Pyloric Sphincter.FOLLOW THIS EASY METHOD : Xiphoid Process.gif ( 7811 bytes ) 1 ) Have the mother lie flat on her back with her helper to one side.2 ) Start two inches below the Xiphoid Process which is the bottom tip of the S",0

"what is Tourette Syndrome ? Tourette Syndrome Gilles de la Tourette syndrome ( Tourette Syndrome or TS ) is a neurological disorder which becomes evident in early childhood or adolescence between the ages of 2 and 15 . Tourette syndrome is defined by multiple motor and vocal tics lasting for more than one year . Many people have only motor tics or only vocal tics . The first symptoms usually are involuntary movements ( tics ) of the face , arms , limbs or trunk . These tics are frequent , repetitive and rapid . The most common first symptom is a facial tic ( eye blink , nose twitch , grimace ) , and is replaced or added to by other tics of the neck , trunk , and limbs . These involuntary ( outside the patient 's control ) tics may also be complicated , involving the entire body , such as kicking and stamping . Many person report what are described as premonitory urges -- the urge to perform a motor activity . Other symptoms such as touching , repetitive thoughts and movements and compulsions can occur . There are also verbal tics . These verbal tics ( vocalizations ) usually occur with the movements ; later they may replace one or more motor tics . These vocalizations include grunting , throat clearing , shouting and barking . The verbal tics may also be expressed as coprolalia ( the involuntary use of obscene words or socially inappropriate words and phrases ) or copropraxia ( obscene gestures ) . Despite widespread publicity , coprolalia/copropraxia is uncommon with tic disorders",0

"Who do you like better Green Day or Linkin Park ? I like Linkin Park . Linkin Park and Green Day ( exept for the album `` American Idiot '' ) are pretty much all I listen to . Here 's why I like Linkin Park the best : > No cussing ( the s-word was on the song `` High Voltage '' , but that 's still not as much as Green Day ) . > The lyrics are much deeper , by far. > The music videos are very creative > So far , Linkin Park has n't had to do any covers of old songs to use as filler on albums , whereas Green Day has done , like , 10. > The musicians themselves are interesting and well rounded people . Mr. Hahn directs the videos , Mike draws/creates album art and can play piano and guitar , as well as write great songs and do his thing as emcee , Phoenix can play violin and cello as well as do his thing as bassist for the band.On , a personal bias , Linkin Park is better because they are ! Plus , they have Chester Bennington . He has a huge vocal range ( whispering > whining > singing > shouting > screaming ) , and could probably sing a song from any musical genre . Of course , he 's a complete psyco , but that makes him an interesting person . And , I can completely relate to some of their songs ( which sometimes freaks me out , on certain songs ) . Also , the songs are louder and more in-your-face than Green Day 's . Sometimes , I like to kick back with a little bit of Green Day , because they 're my second favorite band ( although I ca n't explain why ... ) .",0

Did it hurt using a tampon for the first time ? the best advice is that when trying out tampons for the first time you need to relax ... your vagina is controlled by a muscle and if you 're tense that muscle can tighten up and make it a little uncomfortable to insert the tampon ... I agree plastic applicators are the kind to start out with ... make sure you insert the tampon in fully ... other wise you will feel the tampon and it will feel uncomfortalbe ... it should not hurt you the first time or any time after,0
"Is it true that an ex-boyfriend ca n't be friends with you ? So like this guy that used to like me , were just friends now , but he imed me last night and told me that we could n't be friends anymore because I brought up some feelings he had for me . Should he be able to just drop our friendship like that ? What should I do ? It depends on the two of you . I know a ex married couple that stayed friends after 24 years of being divorced . Thats a long time and a rare occassion . They are my parents lol . Now if you ended on bad terms and are trying to get along then probably not . Or maybe he is still into you and just wants to end it before he gets caught up into the feelings all over again knowing that you can never be together .",0

"Why does my new computer suddenly run very slow when CD-R is accessing data ? ( This is a new problem. ) ? Even when Winamp is playing an mp3 from the hard drive , it will suddenly play very slowly if the CD-R reads something on a CD for another program . It did n't do this when the computer was new ( 3 months ago ) , but just started . instead of ripping CD audio at 18X , it is around 7X now . It 's hard to say what could be the exact cause of the problem , but most problems with speed on a computer somehow tie back to Spyware issues . Many times spyware/adware programs that are running in the background ( depending on which type ) will try to access all your drives ( not only the CD drive , but the HDD as well ) and decrease your machine 's performance . The other possiblity could be a hardware issue , as a technician , I 've seen many times data cables go bad or CD motors fail . You could be running out of RAM , Since the machine is only about 3 months old , i doubt very much it 's hardware ( but i 'd definitely suggest getting the Laser cleaned with a CD laser cleaner ) . The problem is most likely software related ( either spyware or a settings issue ( like a DMA setting or something ) ) . Either way , since you 're more than likely to be under some kind of mfg . warranty , i 'd take advantage and call them up , for some kind of support .",0

"What are the roots of the words in Esperanto ? The grammar itself is extremely easy , although it could have been easier . vocabulary from Romance and Germanic languages ; phonology from Slavic languages As a constructed language , Esperanto is not genealogically related to any ethnic language . Esperanto can be described as `` a language lexically predominantly romanic , morphologically intensively agglutinative and to a certain degree isolating in character '' The phonology , grammar , vocabulary , and semantics are based on the western Indo-European languages . The phonemic inventory is essentially Slavic , as is much of the semantics , while the vocabulary derives primarily from the Romance languages , with a lesser contribution from Germanic . Pragmatics and other aspects of the language not specified by Zamenhof 's original documents were influenced by the native languages of early speakers , primarily Russian , Polish , German , and French.Typologically , Esperanto has prepositions and a pragmatic word order that by default is Subject Verb Object and Adjective Noun . New words are formed through extensive prefixing and suffixing.Esperanto is written with a modified version of the Latin alphabet , including six letters with diacritics : ĉ , ĝ , ĥ , ĵ , ŝ and ŭ ( that is , c , g , h , j , s circumflex , and u breve ) . The alphabet does not include the letters q , w , x , y except in unassimilated foreign names .",0

"War ? Why ? The real reason please . To force a way of life on the conqured ? Or for power and economic gain ? From the earliest history of humanity , war has always been about only two things - for power , and for resources , and many times it is for both - and many other times it is a war for power cloaked under a war for religion or resources . Hitler claimed he attacked poland for resources - he claimed he needed land for the German people , but that was really for his own power . Religious wars have been fought and are fought for power . For the power that those at the top of religion have over thier people . The best way to consolodate your power over your own people is to unify them against an enemy . That goes for political power as well as religious . The religious leaders of Europe fought the holy wars for thier own gains , claiming it was religious duty , however those at the top weilded the power over thier people by sending them to war . The warriors fought for god and religion , but those in power facilitated this . War will never go away because there will never be equity - someone will always have what someone else has . If by some miracle of technology , anyone can have anything , there will still be wars for power - power is the one thing that ca n't be fabricated . If you look at the current muslim extremists , they are not fighting for thier gods , they are fighting for power , and indirectly for resources . They want to create a muslim world , where they will have the power , and by having the power , they will get the resources . If you look at the heart of any conflict , you 'll see it - resources and power . Those are the core reasons for ANY war . However , since it takes two to make war . The Allies could n't stand aside while Hitler took over Europe and killed millions - wars are started by those who want resources and power , but are ended by people who fight for the defense of themselves and others . Wars are rarely started for honorable reasons , but they are often ended by honorable people , who sacrifice themselves to stop the greedy , the evil , and the powerhungry . However , sometimes , those who fight the evil and powerhungry have dishonorable motives of thier own , but they can claim the moral highground because they did n't start the war , and they will benefit from defeating the ones who started it , and maybe because they destroyed a greater evil , it is accepted . Sometimes you have to trade a great evil for a lesser evil.This also goes for society on the small scale as well - Christians claim homosexuals are evil sinners in order to strengthen thier own group - any group gets stronger with a common enemy . There is no better way to facilitate group cohesion , and this group cohesion in this case leads to even more power for those at the top . Life is a power struggle .",0

"Why is marijuana illegal while tobacco continues to kill and get rich ? `` Until 1937 , consumption and sale of cannabis was legal in most American states . In some areas it could be openly purchased in bulk from grocers or in cigarette form at newsstands , though an increasing number of states had begun to outlaw it . In that year , federal law made possession or transfer of cannabis ( without the purchase of a by-then-incriminating tax stamp ) illegal throughout the United States . This was contrary to the advice of the American Medical Association at the time . Legal opinions of the time held that the federal government could not outlaw it entirely . The tax was $ 100 per pound of hemp , even for clothes or rope . The expense , extremely high for that time , was such that people stopped openly buying and making it.The decision of the U.S. Congress was based in part on testimony derived from articles in the newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst , who was heavily interested in DuPont Inc . Some analysts theorize DuPont wanted to boost declining post-war textile sales , and wished to eliminate hemp fiber as competition . Many argue that this seems unlikely given DuPont 's lack of concern with the legal status of cotton , wool , and linen ; although it should be noted that hemp 's textile potential had not yet been largely exploited , while textile factories already had made large investments in equipment to handle cotton , wool , and linen . Others argue that Dupont wanted to eliminate cannabis because its high natural cellulose content made it a viable alternative to the company 's developing innovation : modern plastic . Still , others could argue that hemp could never truly compete with the high strength and elasticity of synthetics , such as nylon . Furthermore , hemp would have been an easy target due to its intoxicating effect , while no rational justification could have been made for outlawing cotton , wool , or linen .

"does anyone know if my boss can fire me ? please see details ? i have been at my job since oct 07 2005 i have never called out or been late my wife is going to be having a baby on the 26th of this month i am going to need four days off from work to take care of our other baby can he fire me for taking this off ? Fathers are allowed to take paternity leave so I do n't think you can get fired . But , I am not sure about that . You can check with your state 's labor dept . to confirm this . Your boss might not like the fact that you will need 4 days off for paternity leave especially since you are a relatively new employee . You will probably not get paid since you most likely have n't accrued sick or vacation time . You should give your boss as much advance notice as you can so he can plan accordingly . If you work for a company that has a Human Resources Dept . you might want to check with them to see how many days you can take ( it may be more than 4 ) and whether you have any sick time that would pay you while your out . You can also go to www.laborlawtalk.com and see if you can get an answer to your paternity leave questions .",0

"How often should you get your well water tested ? We tested it over 8 years ago and it had some pesky little buggers in it so we ca n't drink it . The pump went bad and we fixed it and added clorox to the well like your supposed to . Do the organisms change over time ? Whether the organisms change over time depends on the origin of the microorganisms . If the contamination resulted from surface water intruding into the well , the conditions may have changed.Since you suspected the well water to cause allergic reactions , I 'd advise you have it tested on microorganisms again . The chlorox was added to the water after the pump , or to the bottom ? The intervals of microbiological testing depend on the amount of water you draw and the use you put the water to . If it gets into contact with food or cutlery , I 'd advise intervals of 3 to 5 years . If the chlorox treatment has rendered it drinkable , regular repeats are necessary , also in order to manage the dosage .",0

Ok , I 'm a boy , but hope this will give you a hint . For Valentine , chocolate is a must . If that is not enough , accompany the chocolate with other things , like wine , candy , or cards . You can even give an overkill expensive chocolate , like a branded-brandy-chocolate.Actually , it will be better if you make the chocolate by yourself ( you better make it delicious ) , but I think boy just ca n't do it . If you can , however , make it ( and make it sweet , as sweet as your love ) ! ! Btw , do n't make it sweet if you know that your GF really HATES sweet ^_^ ...

"compare Sabine 's equation with Eyring and Millinton-Sette 's equation ? All of these people worked on models to aid in acoustical design of ampitheatres ( or any space where clearly hearing sound is important ) . The three equations that you listed all take the same general form , and the latter two are subsequent improvements in Sabine 's original work. '' W.C . Sabine carried out a considerable amount of research in this area and arrived at an empirical relationship between the volume of an auditorium , the amount of absorptive material within it and a quantity which he called the Reverberation Time ( RT ) . As defined by Sabine , the RT is the time taken for a continuous sound within a room to decay by 60 dB after being abruptly switched off and is given by : RT = ( 0.161V ) / Awhere V is the volume of the enclosure ( m³ ) and A is the total absorption within the enclosure ( sabine ) . `` `` Several different approaches have been used to derive equations which give values of reverberation time in better agreement with measured results from less reverberant rooms . One of these , the Norris-Eyring formula , assumes an intermittent decay with the arrival of fewer and fewer reflections . This gives the following formula : '' RT = ( 0.161V ) / ( -S ln ( 1-a ) ) '' where S is the total surface area ( m² ) and a becomes the average absorption coefficient . `` `` When the materials of a room have a wide variety of absorption coefficients , the best predictions are obtained by the Millington-Sette equation . This is simply a matter of substituting an effective absorption coefficient ae = -ln ( 1-ai ) into Sabine 's equation to give : '' RT = ( 0.161V ) / ( sum ( -Si ln ( 1-Ai ) ) where Si is the surface area of the ith material , and Ai is its actual absorption coefficient .",0

"Confusing riddle.. who 's who ? At a local bar , three friends , Mr. Green , Mr. Red and Mr. Blue , were having a drink . One man was wearing a red suit ; one a green suit ; and the other a blue suit . `` Have you noticed , '' said the man the blue suit , `` that although our suits have colors corresponding to our names , not one of us is wearing a suit that matches our own names ? '' Mr. Red looked at the other two and said , `` You 're absolutely correct . `` What color suit is each man wearing ? If we apply logic to this , we can assume that since Mr. Red LOOKED at the man with the blue suit , so hence , Mr. Red is n't wearing blue , and since he ca n't wear his own color , then he must be wearing green . Following this , then , the man in the blue suit has to be either Mr. Green , or Mr. Blue . And since no one is wearing their own color , then Mr. Blue can not be the man in the blue suit , so that leaves Mr. Green to be wearing the blue suit . With only the red suit left to figure out , we then assume that Mr. Blue is the one wearing it !",0

"What does sexual side effect mean ? Personal Side Effectsof StatinsImpotence , Loss of Libido and Erectile Dysfunction The pharmaceutical industry would lead us to believe that rapidly bottoming out our natural cholesterol levels through the use of their highly touted statin drugs is a relatively innocuous process of definite benefit to society . But as we learn more each day of this ubiquitous and unique cholesterol substance , we must question the veracity of their medical advisors . Cholesterol is perhaps the most important substance in our lives for we could not live without an abundant supply of it in our bodies . Researchers everywhere are learning how extraordinarily complex and often surprising are the pathways that produce and metabolize cholesterol . Cholesterol is the precursor for a whole class of hormones known as the steroid hormones that are absolutely critical for life , as we know it . These hormones determine our sexuality , control the reproductive process , and regulate blood sugar levels and mineral metabolism . This same substance that society has been taught to fear happens to be our sole source for our hormones , androgen , estrogen and progesterone .",0

That we are all supposed to be the same and teats down people who accept those distinct difference ? Western culture treats us as equal because of the ERA , womens rights movements , and feminist groups that demand equality . Unfortunately , there seems to be an either/or side-effect .

"Are there other active geysers in the world besides Yellowstone 's Old Faithful ? Here is an excerpt from a great reference on Geysers : A geyser is a hot spring that periodically erupts , throwing water into the air . Though that sounds simple , geysers are extremely rare . As of December 2005 , the total of active geysers on earth number approximately 1000.Conditions must be just right for geysers to occur . Three components must be present for geysers to exist : an abundant supply of water , an intense source of heat , and unique plumbing . Water is common in nature , heat can come from volcanic activity , but the plumbing is critical . For water to be thrown into the air , geyser plumbing must be water- and pressure-tight . Geyser scientists and observers have identified the volcanic rock rhyolite as being particularly effective at hosting geysers . Rhyolite is high in silica , which can deposit a water-tight seal along the walls of the geyser plumbing . Most of the geyser fields in the world are found in rhyolite or similar silica-laden rocks ( like ignimbrite ) . The mixture of water , volcanic heat , and plumbing is exceptional at Yellowstone National Park . Over one-half of the world 's geysers are located within the park 's boundaries.It is increasingly apparent that geysers must possess a fourth characteristic to exist : remoteness . Within the last fifty years , volcanic heat and abundant water have been increasingly harnessed to turn turbines for electricity production . Geothermal energy can be produced at any site where volcanic heat and water are readily available . Unfortunately , geyser fields are ideal for this type of energy production . Geothermal energy production steals the geysers ' water , and destroys geyser activity ( for example , Wairakei , New Zealand ) . A growing threat to geysers stems from mineral extraction . Hot groundwater may precipitate gold or other valuable minerals , and extraction may require removing the geyser plumbing itself . For example , in May 2003 , mineral exploration at South America ’ s second largest geyser field ( Puchuldiza , Chile ) , caused cessation in the field ’ s geysers . Few realize the actual rarity of geysers . As a result , many geyser fields have been destroyed and many others are being threatened . LocationsYellowstone National Park ( USA ) Valley of Geysers , Kamchatka Peninsula ( Siberia ) El Tatio ( Chile ) North Island , New ZealandIcelandBeowawe Geyser Field , Nevada ( USA ) Steamboat Springs , Nevada ( USA ) Umnak Island , Alaska ( USA ) Other World GeysersAt least a dozen additional locations worldwide are known to contain between one and fourteen geysers .

"To Christians- Who created God ? If God created man , animals , and everything else , then who created God ? I believe that is the same type of question as where did the matter in the big bang theory come from ? In accordance with the physical laws of this universe , it is impossible for the matter in the big bang theory to have come out of nothing or to have just always existed . It is impossible for something to come out of nothing ... I 'm sure you agree with this . Also , the universe is expanding , which indicates that it had a beginning point in time . So you 're question appears to be , `` If it is impossible for the earth to have always been in existance , how is it logical to believe that God has always been in existance ? `` The thing is , we know that the earth had a beginning and that it is impossible for it to have just come about on its own by the physical laws of this world . But if God created everything ( which I believe He did ) , then He is not bound by the laws He created . He made up the laws of physics . How could He be limited to those laws ? We can not think of God in terms of our physical world . God made up the rules , therefore God is not under the rules . He is eternal . The world which He created is not . Here 's another thought I 'm just going to throw out here , even though it does not go right along with your original question . If you believe that you have a soul or a spirit , or if you believe in any type of spirit beings , how could these have come about by purely by physical means ? Can spiritual things come from physical things ? If this world only came about by matter and not by God , how could matter produce spiritual things ? `` For by Him [ Jesus ] all things were created : things in heaven and on earth , visible and invisble , whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities ; all things were created by Him and for Him . He is before all things , and in Him all things hold together . '' Colossians 1:16-17 ( [ Jesus ] was added by me for clarification of the pronoun Him . )",0

"how does global warming work ? The principle behind global warming is the same as the process that warms the interior of a greenhouse .

These frequencies do n't pass back up through the atmosphere easily but instead are retained by the atmosphere , thus warming it .",0

Math question-Is ln ( a+b ) = lna + lnb ? The trick to remembering the log rules is that they are the same as the exponent rules since logs are just rewritten exponents .

"i 've seen alot of shoes left on the side of the street , some people say it 's a sign for some thing , what is it ? Some of the reasons for this which I have noted : Thieves drop stuff on the road they do not want and are trying to get rid of , often at night or early morning hours . I have even seen many boxes of very expensive cigars.Dogs play with shoes left outside or in trash.People who are drunk lose shoes.People who are struck by vehicle , sometimes shoe ( s ) come off.Stuff falls out/off vehicles while people are moving.Kids throw things out of cars.Some people throw things out of windows.Sometimes you see brand new boot or shoe , but seldom both left and right.Generally I think it is mostly a sign of carelessness and trashiness . Found in big city/environs much more than elsewhere.In Philadelphia I saw a huge difference between burroughs where there was a fine for littering and those where not.The trashiest city of all my extensive travels is Detroit , hands down the big winner.You can actually see people driving and flinging all fast food remnants and garbage out virtually any day . And lots of beer bottles 11pm -- 2am.So , I think it is trashiness and careless sign . In that regard it also reflects societal deterioration away from the desired norms of responsibility , care and cleanliness.The best solution is more of the latter . But that is also difficult to enforce . Nevertheless , I am for at least a $ 50 fine in urban areas , with an alternative of two days of participation in a clean up team . On second offense , both . On third offense , one month of weekends , same for fourth thru sixth . If someone does not reform after all that , I do not know what to do . Prison is too much a drain on taxpayer .

"Could inteligent life have evolved from a different animal group , such as reptiles , birds or even insects ? Does higher intelligence ( such as humans have ) require some quality that only mammals have ? The fact that female mammals produce milk for their young means that at birth a mammal can have a relatively large brain , although they are relatively helpless . Other animals have to be able to at least get around.Brains do n't grow as much as other parts of the body , which is why babies seem to have large heads.The obvious counter-example is birds , where the young are stuck in the nest and depend on their parents for food . However , flight puts a limit on how heavy a bird can be , and so how heavy its brain can be . But flightless birds are a possible candidate.Amphibians and reptiles are cold-blooded , which seems as though it would rule out our sort of intelligence . On the other hand , perhaps an intelligent crocodile would think of slowing down when the temperature drops much as we think of sleep . Remember that a large brain would mean a large egg ( and you have to fit the rest of the body inside the egg as well ) .",0

"When I read Isaiah 53 , I see the saving death of Jesus perfectly described there . Why do n't the Jews see Him ? It is not that the Jews are blind , it is that Christians see the Hebrew Scriptures through Jesus-colored glasses . Since they read the Christian 's New Testament first , then the TaNaCH , they see the TaNaCH through the lens of Christianity . If read on its own , with no knowledge of , or belief in , Christianity , the Hebrew Scriptures would not be seen as being about Jesus.Jews dont see the Christian interpretation in Isaiah 53 , because it contradicts what the Hebrew Scriptures , the Bible says , clearly and consistently , in at least 3 places : In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself as an atonement for the sins of the people . To be written out of God 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . God 's response was `` No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : '' Exodus 32:30-35And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Eternal ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Eternal , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Eternal said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book ... nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the father . Every man must die for his own sin.The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for God 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and God will forgive us . Nowhere in this chapter does it say that we have to have a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins.Ezekiel 18:1-4 ; 20-24 ; 26-27 ... ..Behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul that sinneth , it shall die ... .The soul that sinneth , it shall die . The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father , neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son : the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him , and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him . But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die . All his transgressions that he hath committed , they shall not be mentioned unto him : in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live . Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die ? saith the Eternal God : and not that he should return from his ways , and live ? So , either Deuteronomy 24:16 , `` Every man must die for his own sin '' does not mean that 'every man must die for his own sin , ' and the Christian interpretation of Isaiah 53 is correct , or the Christian interpretation of Isaiah 53 is not correct , and Deuteronomy 24:16 , 'Every man must die for his own sins ' means exactly what it says.Furthermore , Jews read Isaiah up to ( and including Isaiah 53 ) and Isaiah repeatedly refers specifically to the Jews as Gd 's servant . Read Isaiah 41:8 ; Isaiah 44:21 ; Isaiah 45:4 ; Isaiah 49:3 ; Isaiah 44:1 ; Isaiah 48:20 and Isaiah 49:7 Lets concentrate on Isaiah 43:10 : :Isaiah 43:10 `` You are my witnesses , saith the Etrnl , and my servant whom I have chosen : that ye may know and believe me , and understand that I am he : before me there was no Gd formed , neither shall there be after me .

"gay marriage ? Earlier today I read answers to a question that went something like `` if you had only a month to live what would you do ? '' One of the responses was from a gay man who referred to ( among other things ) making sure his accounts etc . were set up so that his `` husband '' had financial security after his death . It is obvious that , although he loves his partner dearly and considers him his husband , he does not enjoy the same rights and privileges that heterosexual married couples take for granted.I would like to hear from gay couples detailing the disadvantages they face due to not being allowed a legal marriage . ( personal experiences only , please - I can do a google search and find the HRC website on my own ) When I got sick and my husband took me to the emergency room , I had to state that I wanted him to go with me because he is not 'family ' and we are not married . I had to state over and over that I wanted him in the room each time a nurse would enter and have something they needed to do . We found out when getting car insurance for both of our cars that if we were married we would get a discount , but because we are not and because our State does not recognize our union , we could not receive those discounts.At work when filing out my medical insurance information ... part of the benefits of my job ... I was not allowed to list my husband as a beneficiary because the term 'spouse ' is defined as being someone of the opposite gender whom you are married to . Had we any children I was informed that I might not have been able to include them either since the State I reside in only allows for one person in a same-sex union to adopt , the other person is n't allowed to adopt that child . When listing whom I wanted as the beneficiary of the life insurance , I could not list my husband with the same benefits a married couple would receive . He would receive much less if I died than he would have if he had been married to a woman . That was upsetting.My husband is Native American . In his tribe while they do not have any laws stating that same-sex marriage is illegal , when he inquired he was told that it is against traditions and that there is no way two people of the same-sex could be recognized in the tribe as a married couple . When asked about adopting children , he was told that adopted children are not considered a part of the tribe and can not participate in tribal activities . When asked if he had a child , surogate , with a woman that was biologically his and adopted by me if the child could still participate in tribal activities he was told that the child could not because it did not reside in a heterosexual married union ... and that also because I am not part of the tribe.We have talked with lawyers about all the legal things we can do . It would all costs far more money than we have , would require a great deal of court time , and even then there is no guarantee that the courts would honor our requests nor is their a guarantee that the legal documents would be honored by our families ( who could dispute them ) . Perhaps the one thing that bothers me most is n't so much all the legal aspects , it 's that people do n't take seriously our commitment and love for each other . When amongst other people when we refer to each other as husbands there are many people who are quick to remind us that we are n't really husbands ( from heteros and homos both ) . It is n't unusual for people to say things about our relationship that they 'd never say to or about a married couple . There is a big disrespect towards us done each time others invalidate and belittle our commitment , our relationship , and our love for each other . That hurts a lot more than the legal issues , but it often underlies the very problems of why such legal issues are n't resolved.And for the record , we are in our mid-twenties , so while many people seem to think that only 'old ' gay people are dealing with these issues ... They 're not .",0
"According to news sites , the Earth 's rotation slows only 2 milliseconds each 100 years . So why the heck are ... so why the heck have we added like over 21 leap seconds in the past 30 years ? ? ? ! ! ! ! Something is not right . If the Earth only slows 2 milliseconds each hundred years , why not just add 2 milliseconds to the clock each century ? ! ! ! nothing to do with daylight savings . Daylight savings is a human invention , not a natural phenomenon ... .because leap seconds are not being added to compensate for the Earth 's rotation slowing down.The amount of time it takes for the earth to revolve around the sun is 365.2425 days.Even that is an approximation , the decimal digits can keep going on.So initially , the calendar was divided evenly in 365 days . But about every 4 years , you 'd be off 1 day . A century later , you 've drifted off by a whole month ! So , leap years came into effect . Febuary has another day every 4 years . But now you 've approximated a year to 365.25 days , when in reality , its 365.2425 days.Every century , you 'll be off 1 day.So that 's where the next rule comes into play : `` If the year is divisible by 4 , but not by 100 , its a leap year . `` Now we 've approximated it to 365.2425 , but because its always going to be an approximation , our calendar days are always slipping . All because the earth does n't take exactly 365 days to go around the sun.This is why leap seconds are added , and not to account for the slowdown of the earth 's rotation.As to why days are divided in exactly 24 hours , I 'm not sure . But I would think the time difference is WAY less than 20 minutes , or we 'd notice that soon enough , its dark at noon ! : ) Time was divided a long time ago , and a simple system was sought for keeping track of it , so the minuts/hour/year thing is a nice division thats easy to do math with . The lost time , if its accounted for by leap years and such , could be easier to manage.First , I never said the earth is not slowing down . I said its not why leap seconds exist . And ok , I can entertain my explanation may be wrong , but that 's no reason for your condescending tone , Jolly Roger . But look , your link brings me to a christian science evanglism site , where is the evidence that my answer is incorrect ? You have n't bothered to explain his original question . If leapseconds account for the slowdown of the earth 's rotation , why are there leap seconds and not leap milliseconds ? If you want to append to your answer , at least try to do so while respecting the other users on this site , and not insult their intelligence.This has piqued my curiosity , if there 's anyone out there that has a source that says my explanation is incorrect , I mean an actual science website , you know , one that steers clear of religion , please let me know .",0

"what are treadmills good for working out ? what do they tone up ? They 're good for your lower torso and your legs . That 's pretty much it . If you want a good OVERALL body workout , you 're going to have to incorporate your arms into the motion on the treadmill - light weights would work , or if it 's a NordicTrack - those work GREAT ! Of course , I 'm a bit biased , because I used to work at NordicTrack ... but I have to admit , I worked OUT when I worked there ; and I DID see improvement in my entire body . Thing is , most treadmills , you use your legs only . If you really want a great workout , and to really tone up your muscles ( meaning to lose baby fat , get ripped , no spare tire , no water retention , etc. , etc ... . ) you need an overall cardiovascular workout . While a treadmill is good for that , you should consider a workout that encompasses the entire body for that will tone you up so much faster than if you did it halfway.Besides ... when those exercise videos say they can help you tone up your abs , or build up a certain body part ... DO N'T fall for it ! ! It does n't work THAT way ! In order to lose weight from a CERTAIN area of your body , you have to lose it EVERYWHERE on your body !

"little white lies and white magic ... why is white perceived as 'good ' ? black magic relates to destruction and sacrifice , but 'white ' magic is the work of growth and creation . a little 'white ' lie is usually regarded as okay , but lying in general is looked down upon . in both cases , why is 'white ' perceived as good ? where did this way of categorizing things come from ? is there a religious reason for this ? First of all little “ white ” lies are only acceptable to some in the general population . Many still believe that all lies are contrary to best behavior . But as an example , I get your point.The association of white with good and black with bad predates recorded history . This generalization is almost universally true in all cultures.The best possible answer goes back to the time before artificial nocturnal lighting . Humans are visual creatures . We tend to rely upon and believe what our visual system records . The eye itself has two kinds of receptors . These are called Rods and Cones . The Rods are more sensitive and give us the shades of gray in “ night vision. ” The Cones respond to colors and are more active during the day . Humans see more clearly and with better spatial acuity during daylight hours.White is a mixture of colors and is only perceived during the day . Daylight = Better vision = Good . At night , when the rods take over : Night = Poor vision = Bad.For a very detail report on vision , try the site below :",0
"in connectiom to my last question , Who gave us the knowlegde to be able to attain this said evolution ? Erin pls answer this one ... . all can answer ... . Thats the problem , we dont have to ask who created the creator because we are told that God just `` is , was , and always will be '' . The arrogance of man to think that we are smart enough to understand everything is our greatest downfall . Ever hear people say that when they think they know everything , they learn that they know very little ? Virtually everything that we know today was once unreasonable to the abilities of our brain . Just like no one knew about gravity until it was discovered and able to be measured . People thought the Earth was flat , and when they were told it was round , it took many years before they realized the person was right . Then they discovered later it was somewhat oval . Just because the most intelligent scientist in the world can not understand supernatural things , dont mean they dont exist . Maybe someday someone will discover a way to `` see '' these things too , so that everyone will have the knowledge . Just because it hasnt happened yet dont mean we are at the end of all learning , and it wont.The fact that we are the only animals on the planet that aspire for greatness , desire things that we dont need , and have learned how to create things ourself is proof that God created us in His image . We dont question why we have the ability to learn and evolve , we just take it for granted.Mankind has in effect became gods , because they forgot and no longer appreciate what created them . They believe as long as they can invent and create new things that now they are gods . This has been prophesied in Revelation . Part of being marked with the mark of the beast is man becoming their own god .",0

"what is your definition of myoelastic-aerodynamics ? ? ? Myoelastic-aerodynamic TheoryEarly voice researchers in the 1950 's and 1960 's explained vocal fold oscillation with the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory . According to these theories , Bernoulli forces ( negative pressure ) cause the vocal folds to be sucked together , creating a closed airspace below the glottis . Continued air pressure from the lungs builds up underneath the closed folds . Once this pressure becomes high enough , the folds are blown outward , thus opening the glottis and releasing a single 'puff ' of air . The lateral movement of the vocal folds continues until the natural elasticity of the tissue takes over , and the vocal folds move back to their original , closed position . Then , the cycle begins again . Each cycle produces a single small puff of air ; the sound of the human voice is nothing more than tens or hundreds of these small puffs of air being released every second and filtered by the vocal tract . Let 's further examine the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory . Myo- means muscle ; the vocal folds , after all , are mostly comprised of muscle tissue . The -elastic suffix serves to remind us that the vocal fold is elastic and that we have active control over its elastic properties . Aerodynamic means that the theory deals with the motion of air and other gaseous fluids , and with the forces active on bodies in motion ( such as the vocal folds ) in relation to such fluids .",0

"What do you think of President Bush sellin our ports to Arabs ? Update : `` He became aware of it over the last several days , '' McClellan said . Asked if Bush did not know about it until it was a done deal , McClellan said , `` That 's correct . `` First of all , I just want to say that it 's obvious not `` all Arabs are terrorists '' and objection to this port deal is not suggesting in the least bit that they are . You see a lot of the educated Congressmen , of both parties , objecting to the sale of these ports to a UAE company . These are intelligent , educated people and you think that they are objecting to this deal because they believe that all Arabs are terrorists ? I think not . The first perons who answered this question is the one who needs to get educated.It is justifiable to say that giving control of these major US ports to a company in the UAE poses a threat to national security . This situation is comparable to the notion of `` probable cause . '' If a police officer sees a person driving dangerously and erratically he has reason to believe that this person might be intoxicated . If two of the September 11 hijackers came from the UAE and money used to fund those attacks went through UAE banks , we have reason to believe that giving control of major ports to a UAE company is an added threat to security.There is no argument against the fact the UAE is located in a region of the world where anti-Western sentiment is strong . UAE control of these ports gives people a greater opportunity to act of these feelings.Sorry to say , but there is a difference between a British company operating these ports and a UAE company operating these ports . I am a strong supporter of President Bush on 95 % of the issues , but I do not know where his head is regarding this issue , if he really did know about this before the deal was made .",0

"Why do people say `` God bless you '' after one sneezes ? The custom of saying `` God bless you '' after a sneeze was begun literally as a blessing . Pope Gregory the Great ( 540-604 AD ) ascended to the Papacy just in time for the start of the plague ( his successor succumbed to it ) . When someone sneezed , they were immediately blessed ( `` God bless you ! '' ) in the hope that they would not subsequently develop the plague . All that prayer apparently worked , judging by how quickly the plague of 590 AD diminished . It is also interesting to note that it is impossible to close your eyes when you sneeze , so everytime I sneeze , I try to say a little prayer .",0

"What is nesidioblastomia ? It 's disease of some kind , but I am not sure what it is . nesidioblastosis Nesidioblastosis is a controversial medical term for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia attributed to an abnormal microscopic appearance of pancreatic islet development . The term was coined in the first half of the 20th century . The abnormal histologic aspects of the tissue included the presence of islet cell enlargement , islet cell dysplasia , beta cells budding from ductal epithelium , and islets in apposition to ducts.By the 1970s , nesidioblastosis was primarily used to describe the pancreatic dysfunction associated with persistent congenital hyperinsulinism and in most cases from the 1970s until the 1970s , it was used as a synonym for what we now refer to as congenital hyperinsulinism.The term fell into disfavor after it was recognized in the late 1980s that the characteristic tissue features were sometimes seen in pancreatic tissue from normal infants and even adults , and is not consistently associated with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia . Most congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by different mechanisms than excessive proliferation of beta cells in a fetal pattern.A small number of case reports have purported to describe nesidioblastosis in adults",0

I have a bad cough , it always produces a mouth full of mucus . It pockets in the back of my throat . It has gotten so bad that it disrupts my sleep . I take a cloth to bed each night to clean my mouth . If any one has ever had this problem , please let me know what you did for relife . I have spent a small fortune on doctors and medicine . As of now , no help . Thank you . I had the same problem , I could n't breathe through my nose because , my nose and mouth were constantly full of mucus and I was constantly spitting out this gunk . Sometimes , I would be choking and gagging in my sleep . A relative sent me a print-out of the side effects of the medication I was taking . It included breathing problems , mucus buildup , nodules ( which I now have exactly where my sinuses are ) and a lot of other dangerous side effects . I went off the med . and while I still have some mucus production it is no where near what it used to be . My doctor tried to get me to go back on the same med . even after I told him about the mucus problems it caused . He said it did n't do that . When I insisted that it did , he looked it up on his computer and then said `` if that happens again , you can always go off it '' . Needless to say , I refused to take it . Also , on one exam , the nurse told me I had polyps in my nose . She told me to see an ENT and have them removed ( surgically ) . I am glad I did n't . I just saw an M.D . on tv who said that when polyps in your nose are removed , they usually will come back . He said a safe non-surgical way to get rid of them is to use Nasonex twice a day and it is safe to do that . I think I 'll take his advice and try it . I do n't know why some doctors first advice is surgery especially if there is a non-surgical way to remedy a problem . I hope you find a solution to your problems .",0

"Which is better , AMD or Intel ? I know for a fact that AMD is much better than Intel ! AMD 's processors run a lot faster and cooler . A cooler running processor is important . Not only does it mean that AMD processors have a faster clock speed than comparable Intel products but AMDs also have a longer life expectancy as well . Plus AMD costs quite a bit less than their Intel counterparts . AMD is also ahead on the technology curve as well . They were the first company to introduce the 64-bit PC processor many months ahead of Intel ’ s 64-bit processor . This is why I believe that AMD will possibly out live Intel.I 've had both brands and nobody can even come close AMD ’ s speed and power ! I am running a newer AMD Sempron 3000+ with 512 MB of memory and Windows 2000 Professional SP4 for my operating system and this combination works great.From now on AMD , is the only processor for me . This is just my honest opinion . And no , I do not work for or get any gratuity from AMD for saying this .",0
"Is Intel Better or AMD ? Can anyone tell me whether AMD computers are better or the Intel ones . I was told by somebody that even AMD Sempron does not require any additional graphic card and could play any type of game however high graphics the game may have . The graphics built into the motherboard is what controls the graphics , not the cpu . Having a fast processor helps , but to play games like half life 2 you would probably still need to buy a separate graphics card . Your computer is only as fast as the weakest link so do n't overspend in one area ( cpu ) and leave another too slow ( memory or graphics ) . For processor speed comparisons check out the link . Look for the benchmarks at the end . The site reviews many different computer parts .",0
"Are political ideologies still relevant ? pls provide current and relevant examples ... ..include only the three major ideologies namely : conservatism , liberalism , socialism yes . perfect example was harriet miers ' nomination to the supreme court . this is a perfect example of how the conservative base influenced our elected officials ( president bush ) . conservatives believe that appointed judges should interpret the law only . not legislate from the bench . i.e . roe vs wade . there are other examples . but , i think this one speaks volumes about the ideoligical right having an impact recently . as far as liberalism and socialism ... i 'm not sure exactly what the difference is . i think that any candidate for national election always moves to the right to campaign . then , tries to govern from the left . look at hillary clinton right now . she is trying to move to the right to position herself as a moderate . it 's a real dilemma for a known liberal . she is running the risk of alieanating her base , in order to grab some swing votes . i 'm sure she 's done a lot of focus groups on this . but , i believe the american people will see through this in 2008. i believe the american people , in general , are conservative . running and governing from the right works every time it 's tried . it 's only when president bush or members of congress try to appease their rivals on the left , that their mandate is mitigated .",0

"What is the best way to get better abdominal muscles ? First and foremost , stay away from any ab machine.For the upper abs , focus on crunches which effectively work the abdominals better than sit-ups or any machine on the market.For the lower abs , keep in mind there is very little muscle tissue there so decreasing levels of body fat is the most effective way to bring out the best in this area . Hanging leg raises , v-situps and reverse curls are among some of the best exercise for this region . Always make sure your pelvis curls up to maximize lower abdominal contraction during these exercises.As far as fat loss and getting ripped goes , cardio , cardio , cardio . In the morning , on an empty stomach at about 70-80 % of your maximum heart rate for about 30-45 minutes .

Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea ! for the devil is come down unto you , having great wrath , because he knoweth that he hath but a short time . 12:13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth , he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child . 12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle , that she might fly into the wilderness , into her place , where she is nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent . 12:15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood . 12:16 And the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth . 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman , and went to make war with the remnant of her seed , which keep the commandments of God , and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .",0

The petition filed by advocate M.D.Tahir for the said reason was sent to the Chief Justice , requesting him to reconstitute the bench.The petition pertains to 0.24 million people who fought shoulder to shoulder with Pakistan army in East Pakistan in 1971 war and were got stranded in Bangladesh after Dhaka Fall . Living in 66 camps and on 1-Kg atta per individual per month , they still await their return to Pakistan , which had promised to bring them home.The petitioner says i salaute biharies for sacrifies they made in 1971 for sake of pakistan.But i am telling u a harsh fact about pakistani attitude toward biharies Punjab accepted large number of muslims from east pakistan because they were punjabies.Pakistan had to accept 3 million afghans because their kinsmen pathans were present in Pakistan.indian muhajirs in sindh have conflict with local pathans and sindhis because they are not related to locals.same is the case with biharis , no province is ready to accept them.As for as governament is concerned it had taken few small steps in the past which were failures . i hope biharies get right place for living in future",0

Because being obese is more than just being a few pounds overweight , people who are obese have usually been getting more calories than they need for years .",0

"Which is the world 's oldest religion ? ? The world 's oldest religion , atleast chronologically from a historic perspective is Hinduism ( Sanatana Dharma ) . However , please keep in mind that everyone of every religion considers their religion to not be 'new ' . Christianity is seen as a fulfillment of prophecies based in Judaism . Baha'i is based upon prophecies in Islam . So as far as Judaism , Christianity , Islam , and Baha'i , if you ask a member of this religion they can each point backwards through the Abrahamic traditions to how each 'fulfilled ' other areas , thus keeping them within the same line . THe same can be said of Buddhism , Jainism , Sikhism , etc . So when asking this question it is best to be aware of what exactly you are wanting to know . As one Christian I know said `` Jesus was a part of God in the begining , thus Christianity is the oldest religion because Jesus was always a part of God , but it is young if you only compare it from a historic chronological perspective . '' I think that is well said.Thus from a Historice Chronological Perspective from oldest to youngest the religions go : HinduismZoroastrianismJudaismJainismBuddhismTaoismConfucismShintoChristianityIslamSikhismBaha'iNeoPaganism*Please note that many in the NeoPagan movement claim direct connection to the Pagan past and often direct it to a specific ancient culture/civilization , but not all . Some state that theirs is a new religion based upon a revitalization of ancient religions , but not the ancient religions themselves . So one has to be careful in this area , too . Native American beliefs and Shamanism are not listed , nor did I name Unitarian-Universalism , Rastafarianism , etc . I mainly listed major world religions . ( UUs do not necessarily view themselves as a religion in itself , but rather an approach to religion with many in a UU congregation holding a wide variety of beliefs from many of the worlds religions . There are some UU , though , who would claim that as their religion so no offense to those who do ) .",0
"intense , sometimes burning abdominal spasms ? i get intense , sometimes burning abdominal spasms for a few minutes after urinating or having an orgasm . i dont have an STD or an UTI ( recently tested for both and never had either ) . i 've been to an urologist , internist and gynocologist and they have n't found the root of my problem . at first i thought it was a bladder infection but that was n't it . then i checked the uterus and even had a DnC procedure ( due to a possible polyp ) but nothing was found . the urologist tested me for a small urethra , cystitis , etc . and simply gave me some pills to call down the spasms after i pee . it 's become a chronic issue and i 'm getting nowhere with the doctors . has anyone had this sort of problem ?

"Not including Apple , what company makes the best labtops and why ? Thank you. ? I am looking to buy a new laptop and i know very little about them or computers period for that matter . I 'm looking for reliabilty more than anything else . I dont want to be fixing the damn thing up every two weeks . No screen problems , no crashing motherboards , no excessive overheating . I hope you guys can help ! ! ! Thanks again . Also if you could give me a crash course on computer specifications and what exactly they mean . ( gigahertz , pentium , celeron ) what is all that a measurement of , and how should it affect me when i go to buy my notebook . What should i be looking for . I 'll be using the notebook for internet and typing papers . Thanks guys ! ! ! I work on an HP Compaq NC6000 that work supplied me and I like it . I 've had it over a year . It 's been reliable and fast . My wife has owned a Toshiba for over three years.I surf the internet , play music on it , write technical papers , send e-mails , write programs , and run numerical analyses on it.Battery life could be better . I can only go for about an hour and a half before the battery depletes.If you are going to be taking notes in classes , you may want to get two batteries for it so you can get several hours of uptime without connecting to a power supply.The rest of it ... Gigahertz , Pentium , Celeron , AMD really does n't matter these days . Almost any laptop will play DVDs ( with a DVD player ) , CDs , etc plenty fast.In fact , the lower the Gigahertz ( the clock rate which at which the processor ( AMD or Intel ) ticks along ) , the longer your batter life may be . Slowest Gigahertz you should go with is about 1.5GHz.I would make sure that the notebook has at least 512MB of memory , preferably 1GB . This is important if you run several programs at once ( e-mail , internet , music player , and word processor ) . If you do n't , things can slow down and wear down battery life faster as data is moved on and off disk.I would go with a 15 '' LCD . 17 '' is better if you are at your desk all the time , but if you are carrying the thing around a lot , the smaller display makes for a more compact laptop . To each his own.Any brand-name laptop ( HP , Dell , IBM , Toshiba ) should do well to meet your requirements .",0
"name the us possessions and territories ? A History of United States Insular Areas : How the Relationships Began From 1899 to 1941 , Guam was under U.S . Naval Administration . At the outbreak of World War II , the Japanese seized Guam and occupied the island for two and a half years . American forces recaptured Guam in July 1944 , and the U.S . Naval Administration resumed responsibility when peace returned.In 1950 , the U.S. Government enacted the Guam Organic Act , conferring U.S. citizenship on the people of Guam and establishing local self-government . Under the Organic Act of 1950 , the Secretary of the Interior assumed administrative responsibility for Guam , formerly vested in the Secretary of the Navy.The United States purchased the Virgin Islands for $ 25 million from Denmark in 1917 . The Virgin Islands were placed under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy until they were transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1931.Interior 's relationship with other U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands stemmed from a post-World War II trusteeship . The Northern Mariana Islands , the Marshall , Palau , Yap , Kosrae , Chuuk and Pohnpei Islands were grouped into the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands ( TTPI ) by the United Nations in 1947 . Under the Trusteeship Agreement with the U.N. Security Council , the United States exercised administrative jurisdiction over the TTPI.The Navy administered the TTPI until 1951 , when that authority was given to the Secretary of the Interior . During those initial years of authority , the Secretary of the Interior exercised broad administrative authority in all the insular areas . Chief executives of the insular governments were appointees of the President or the Secretary and the Secretary had the legal authority to supervise and give binding directions to them.However , this is no longer the case . Popularly elected legislatures ( Guam-1950 , USVI-1954 , American Samoa-1961 , and the CNMI-1979 ) and governors ( Guam and USVI 1971 , American Samoa 1978 , the CNMI , 1979 ) were established . Each of the U.S. insular areas has become responsible for the administration of local government functions . Although the Congress has placed with the Secretary , certain continuing budget and program coordination authority and responsibility concerning U.S. insular affairs , the local governments are not entities of the Department , nor are they agencies or instrumentalities of the Federal Government.Except for CNMI , which became a commonwealth of the U.S. , the remaining TTPI entities chose a dramatically different political status.On May l , l979 , the United States recognized the Constitution of the Marshall Islands and the establishment of the Government of the Marshall Islands ( RMI ) . The United States recognized the Federated States of Micronesia ( FSM ) constitution in 1979 and establishment of the Government of the FSM , both national and state levels . FSM created the 4 State levels from the islands of Yap , Chuuk , Pohnpei and Kosrae.On October 1 , 1994 , the Compact of Free Association between the United States and Palau entered into force , ( U.S. Public Law 99-658 ) . The Compact entered into force for the Marshall Islands on October 2l , l986 , ( Presidential Proclamation No . 5564 ) . The FSM Compact was fully implemented on November 3 , 1986 ( Presidential Proclamation No . 5564 ) .Under the Compact , the status of free association recognizes each Freely Associated State as a sovereign state with the capacity to conduct foreign affairs consistent with the terms of the Compact . The Compact places full responsibility for defense with the United States . The Compact also provides grant funds and Federal program assistance , principally through the Department of the Interior.Under the Compact , the State Department is responsible for government-to-government relations , while Interior is responsible for the oversight and coordination of U.S. programs and funding assistance.District of ColumbiaAmerican SamoaGuamPuerto RicoNorthern Marianas",0
"Signs of jealousy on the 2nd date ? does this indicate a dificult person ? It indicates either a insecure or controlling person . Not good traits for a good relationship . A insecure person will always think that he is not good enough for you or you are cheating on them because they are not good enough.A controlling person will slowly cut you off from your friends , family and co-workers . It will start off with little comments of how stupid that friend is and grow from there.It is better to not be with someone of either of these personality traits .",0
"How do people steal and live with themselves ? Do n't you know you are the bottomfeeders of the earth ? There are two questions you ask.1 . ) -- Conciousness is strong feeling ( nature of which , by the way is impossible to describe from atheistic perspective ) which hardly gives you a break . Therefore it is hard to live if you steal . However , if someone repeats crime over and over again his conciouseness get used to it more and more so he/she lives pretty good with stealing. -- Also , ( it is not excuse though ) , people can steal for a different purposes ... self-preservation most powerful probably ... 2 ) -- Second question I do n't uderstand .

The problem I seem to be haveing is the `` THEFTS '' happened in California , yet I live in Colorado . What problems will I have if I prosecute in Colorado compared with California ... compared with a federal case .

You should contact your credit card company to follow up and ask what they 'll do to press charges against the one who defrauded you , if they know who he is . It 's more up to them to decide at this point , since they hold the information and the control , and since it 's mostly in their best interest .

"what do you do yourself to cut down your appetite ? The basics of most nutrition booksDon ’ t starve yourself . That ’ s the worst thing you can do in a diet because it slows down your metabolism and your body starts getting more fat from your food intake since , fat is the bodies fastest and easiest type of nutrition [ not the healthiest though ] . The reason this happen is because this helped us when we were no doing so good as hunters and gathers to keep us alive a bit longer . Before I continue let me explain protein , carbohydrates , and fats.Protein is easiest described as anything that comes from or was an animal such chicken , fish , sirloin , and milk . Carbohydrates [ carbs ] can be found almost in anything else even apples.Good carbs : Apples , wheat bread , sourdough bread , grains , and wheat Bad carbs : White bread , hamburger buns , hotdog buns , Doritos , and sodas ! Good fats : Avocados , pecans , almonds , and peanut butter The ratio in your diet varies but I think a good starting point is something like [ 50 % Protien:40 % Carbs:10 % fat ] This can sound meaningless . So in plain terms consume only good fats [ portioned ] and you should be okay . Something like a handful of almonds , or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [ separately . not consecutively ] . The reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because you are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [ Proteins are 4 calories , Carbs are 4 calories , Fats are 9 calories ] so theoretically if you eat less fats and more proteins you will have a less appetite because you will eat more . Another nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself . That ’ s how the Adkins basically works . If you consume more proteins and less carbs you will lose weight . I leave to you to decide if this is good you.I would also advice you to split up your day into 5 meals . [ warning : it will feel weird because you are not used to eating this decreased amount . Just keep in mind that you will eat in 3 hour and you will quickly noticed that you will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry ] if you do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla.You are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [ if you have been starving yourself or if you don ’ t exercise ] .",0

I seem to remember reading somewhere that in the old sled/carriage days that if a fellow teamster had to bail you out of trouble , you traditionally gave them your sleighbells as a thank you ( or mark of shame ? ) . Ca n't find that reference any more . Direct quote from http : //www.rootsweb.com/~genepool/meanings.htm : `` To be somewhere with `` bells on '' refers to a practice peddlers had when they roamed the area west of the Appalachians selling wares . To avoid Indians , they traveled as silently as possible until they reached a settled area . Then they unmuffled bells hung around their horses necks to announce their arrival to outlying cabins . Hence , `` I 'll be there with bells on . '' The peddlers ' arrival was a much anticipated major event in the mostly tedious and hard lives of settlers , not only for the goods they sold , but also for the news , letters , and messages they carried from the outside world .

"How does the cold make you cough ? What 's the connection between bad weather and microbes inside us ? It 's simple . Our bodies system , especially the defense system , work best on a range of temperature . When the temperature outside ( that will affect the inside body temperature ) is changed , it changed the whole things that happened in our body , such as hormones , blood pressure , and especially , the lifosit ( the body 's defense `` army '' ) . Sure , if the lifosit ca n't work well , so does the entire body 's defense system . But why microbes still can live at its best ? Simple , because the microbes ' temperature tolerance is higher ( or `` cooler '' ) than our body.So in short , when our body is in cold , it 's just like a snow hurricane winter to our body 's defense system , but still a summer springtime for the microbes . When the microbes spread over the body , it then attacks the part of the body that it loves , such as the brain ( so that it makes you dizzy ) , the defense system ( and the body reacted with rising your body temperature to reactivate the lifosit ) , and the sponge organ within our neck ( that 's their fave place ) . That 's the reason why if you get cold , wearing a syal or drinking hot tea makes better .",0

"what is the meaning of `` voyager 2 '' ? The Voyager 2 spacecraft was launched in 1977 . It is identical to its sister Voyager program craft , Voyager 1 , but Voyager 2 followed a somewhat different trajectory during its Saturn encounter , bypassing a close encounter with Titan to take advantage of a gravitational slingshot to travel on to Uranus and Neptune . It thus became the first and so far only probe to visit those two planets and the first spacecraft to make the Grand Tour of Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune . This was possible only due to a rare geometric arrangement of those four planets that only occurs once every 175 years [ 2 ] .",0

"i need to present a rememberence speech for a friend that died.. can u help ? I did that once , and it was so hard , but worth it . The best thing you can do is include an aspect from every group of people whose lives they affected . This paints a whole picture of the person and allows everyone to take part in the experience . But definitely pick those things which meant the most to you personally . It allows you to say those things you never got to say before . And whatever you say about them , pick many things that will bring smiles out of the people you are talking to , it eases the pain a little , and if you believe they are present after they pass , I 'm sure they do n't want everyone to suffer .",0
"define ergonomics elobrately ? Ergonomics ( or human factors ) is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system , and the profession that applies theory , principles , data and methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance ( definition adopted by the International Ergonomics Association in 2000 ) .Ergonomists contribute to the design and evaluation of tasks , jobs , products , environments and systems in order to make them compatible with the needs , abilities and limitations of people ( IEA , 2000 ) .DomainsThe IEA divides ergonomics broadly into three domains : Physical ergonomics deals with the human body 's responses to physical and physiological loads . Relevant topics include manual materials handling , workstation layout , job demands , and risk factors such as repetition , vibration , force and awkward/static posture as they relate to musculoskeletal disorders ( see repetitive strain injury ) .Cognitive ergonomics , also known as engineering psychology , concerns mental processes such as perception , attention , cognition , motor control , and memory storage and retrieval as they affect interactions among humans and other elements of a system . Relevant topics include mental workload , vigilance , decision-making , skilled performance , human error , human-computer interaction , and training.Organizational ergonomics , or macroergonomics , is concerned with the optimization of sociotechnical systems , including their organizational structures , policies , and processes . Relevant topics include shift work , scheduling , job satisfaction , motivational theory , supervision , teamwork , telework and ethics.HistoryItalian Bernardino Ramazinni ( 1633-1714 ) became the first physician to write about work-related injuries and illnesses in his 1700 publication , `` De Morbis Artificum ( Diseases of Workers ) '' . Ramazinni was ostracized by his fellow doctors for visiting the workplaces of his patients in order to identify the causes of their disorders . The term ergonomics ( from the Greek words ergon [ work ] and nomoi [ natural laws ] ) first entered the modern lexicon when Wojciech Jastrzębowski used the word in his 1857 article Rys ergonomji czyli nauki o pracy , opartej na prawdach poczerpniętych z Nauki Przyrody ( adapted from a previous version of this page ) .Later in the 19th century , Frederick Taylor pioneered the `` Scientific Management '' method , an approach that sought the single best method to perform a job and its tasks . By incrementally reducing the size and weight of coal shovels until the optimum shoveling rate was reached , Taylor tripled the amount of coal that workers could shovel in a day . Frank and Lilian Gilbreth , in the early 1900s , expanded Taylor 's methods to develop `` Time and Motion Studies '' that aimed to improve efficiency by eliminating unnecessary steps and actions . By applying this approach , the Gilbreths reduced the number of motions in bricklaying from 18 to 4.5 , allowing bricklayers to increase their pace of laying bricks from 120 to 350 bricks per hour.World War II marked the advent of highly sophisticated machines and weaponry , creating previously unseen cognitive demands on operators in terms of decision-making , attention , situational awareness and hand-eye coordination . It was observed that perfectly working aircraft , flown by the best-trained pilots , still crashed . In 1943 , Alphonse Chapanis , a lieutenant in the U.S. Army , showed that `` pilot error '' could be greatly reduced when more logical and differentiable controls replaced confusing designs in airplane cockpits.In the decades following the war and leading to today , ergonomics has continued to flourish and diversify . The Space Age created new human factors issues such as weightlessness and extreme G-forces . To what extent could these environments be tolerated and what effects would they have on the mind and body ? The Information",0

"If you were to die tonight , where will you spend eternity ? Every one spends time preparing for their lives here on earth . We focus on making money , which of course we need to pay bills and live with some kind of security . Yet for some , money is all they ever think about- and they become greedy and greediness leads to selfishness and people stop caring about what really matters . We stop caring about how precious life is . How God gave us the air we breathe and the ability to be creative and work towards building relationships with others and with God our creator . When we become greedy we lose out because our whole life is spent grabbing wealth so we can get ahead . Ahead for what ? New house , more cars , more hedonistic pleasures to fulfill the emptiness we really feel inside . The Bible says , `` money is the root of all evil . '' When you look around at all the evil in the world it most likely can be traced back to greed . We ca n't take it with us when we go . We came into the world naked and we 'll go out that way . Think about it ! What 's important ? I plan on spending eternity in Heaven with my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ ! You are right that the Bible says that Money is the root of all Evil and you cant take it with you !

The gifts that we give to others is but a symbol of the gift that God gave to us .

So the hearing should improve as the fluid goes away and make sure your daughter finishes the full course of the Amoxicillin , or the bacteria in the fluid can start multiplying again and she can end up even sicker than before .

"when was karate invented ? Karate is a multi-cultural development , absorbing the contributions of many gifted practitioners over time and crossing many borders . Compiling a reasonably accurate history of Karate is challenging.The development of Karate occurred chiefly in Okinawa and China in the 19th century , and Japan in the early 20th century . This was an especially turbulent period in history for that area of the world , including Japan 's official annexation of the Okinawan island group in 1874 , the First Sino-Japanese War ( 1894-1895 ) , the Russo-Japanese War ( 1904-1905 ) , and the rise of Japanese expansionism ( 1905-1945 ) . The wars caused disruptions and upheaval , and incentives for concealment . The Karate styles within Japan have fairly clean lineages ; but any assessment of how Karate crossed borders in this period is complicated by issues of nationalism , the historic Japanese racism faced by non-Japanese Asians , and the typical resentment of occupied peoples toward a conqueror . Many recognizeable offshoots of Karate , particularly in Korea , deny the name because of nationalistic ideals and the word 's association with Japan ; likewise , some obvious offshoots of Karate are disowned by Japanese practitioners , perhaps because of a Japanese preoccupation with primacy or purity . [ edit ] Karate 's Origins in OkinawaJapan annexed the nominally independent Okinawan island group in 1874 after centuries of strong Japanese influence over the kingdom 's affairs . One might suggest that something of `` Okinawan '' origin ( such as Karate ) could be equally desribed as being of `` Japanese '' origin . The relationship between Okinawa and Japan is complicated . For purposes of discussing Karate , it is convenient to speak of Okinawa and Japan as separate entities . The question of whether Karate is Japanese or Okinawan is somewhat akin to asking whether the luau or the hula dance are American traditions or Hawaiian ones . They developed in Hawaii prior to when Hawaii became one of the United States , and so are usually described as Hawaiian , not American . Similarly for Karate , which is of Okinawan origin . [ edit ] HistoryKarate is a mixture of indigenous Okinawan fighting arts and empty-handed Chinese fighting arts , the latter having been brought to Okinawa by political envoys , merchants , and sailors to and from Fujian Province . Estimates of the amount of Chinese influence vs. Okinawan influence in modern Karate vary considerably , from 40 % Chinese/40 % Okinawan/20 % other to 80 % Chinese/20 % Okinawan . Some believe that there is also a Japanese jujutsu influence stemming from the long Japanese presence on Okinawa.In 1722 , Sakugawa , who had studied pugilism and staff fighting in China , started teaching a fighting art in the city of Shuri that he called `` Karate-no-sakugawa . '' This was the first known recorded reference to the art of Karate ( 唐手 ) in a modern form . The word `` Kara '' ( 唐 ) referred to China itself , and `` Te '' ( 手 ) meant hand , in the sense of a style of fighting ; so Karate meant `` the Chinese techniques '' or `` Tang Hand '' .To this day Karate still bears a striking resemblance to Fujian martial arts such as Fujian White Crane , Five Ancestors , and Goroquan ( Hard Soft Fist , pronounced `` Gōjūken '' in Japanese ) . For the most part there were no particular styles of `` te '' , but rather a network of practitioners with their own individual methods and eclectic traditions . Early styles of karate can be generalized as Shuri-te , Naha-te and Tomari-te , named after the three cities in which they emerged . Each city ( and the teachers who lived there ) had particular kata , techniques , and principles that distinguished its local version of te from the others.Around the 1820 's , Sokon Matsumura taught a synthesis of te ( Shuri-te and Tomari-te ) and Shaolin ( Chinese 少林 ) styles . It would become the style Shorin-Ryu ( `` Little Forest '' ) . Matsumura taught his karate to An",0

"Why do some people grind their teeth when they sleep ? Teeth grinding , or bruxism , is often related to stress . It also can be caused by crooked or missing teeth or by something that creates an abnormal bite , such as a high spot on a molar . To diagnose bruxism , dentists look for flattened spots on the teeth . Treatment includes smoothing down those high spots and behavior modification for stress reduction . Your dentist also may recommend a mouth guard or a custom-made splint to be worn at night . These prevent teeth from coming together , which interrupts the grinding and gives muscles a chance to relax.Here 's some more information : Bruxism can have a variety of psychological and physical causes . These include stress , the body 's reaction to poor tooth alignment , as a complication of severe brain injury , or as an uncommon side effect of some antidepressant medications .",0

"what 's ur idea about iran and NUCLEUS energy ? The idea to contain nuclear proliferation is to have as few countries as possible have atomic weapons .

A number of countries will assist other countries in constructing a peace nuclear energy plant.The problem occurs when a country wants to develop their own nuclear industry , purportedly for peaceful purposes and their government is not stable and their plans for such development are clearly for weapons development . Iran falls into this latter category.Russia has offered to develop for them ( on Russian soil ) the nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes and Iran has turned this down . They want nuclear weapons and they already have the missile systems which deliver them at least as far as Europe . They support the destruction of Israel and it is a surety that if they had such weapons they would use them.They will be helped to have atomic energy plants for peaceful purposes , they will not be allowed to have an atomic weapons development program . .",0

"Definitions ? please ! ? Please describe the following and how the 're usedResource-Oil -Natural Gas-Coal-Water-Wood- In the context of your question , A resource is a source of material or energy that may be consumed , changed , or dispersed to the point it is no longer easily usable . Examples would be copper ore , oxygen in the atmosphere , helium gas taken from oil wells , water , sand , or even soil . Anything we do consumes or utilizes some sort of resource . Breathing uses oxygen from the air . Copper is used for wiring and piping . Helium is used for scientific research and birthday balloons . Sand is used to make concrete . Water is used for drinking , irrigation , and generating hydroelectric power . Soil is used for growing crops . None of these are exhaustive lists , just examples . Oil : Oil is a mixture of organic compounds extracted from the earth by drilling . It is created from organic materials deposited in sedimentary rock that are altered by heat , pressure , and biotic processes to create it . Oil is used to make gasoline , diesel , airplane fuel , plastic , shampoo , rubber , antihistamines , and many other products . Natural gas : It is an organic gas that is also extracted from the earth by drilling . It is generated by a similar process to that for oil generation . It is used to heat homes , make fertilizer , and some plastics . Water : Water is found in many forms , but mostly as either fresh or saltwater . Fresh water is used for drinking , irrigation , etc . Saltwater is not as useful directly to man , but is an essential part of our environment as the oceans both support food supplies and have a large effect on the climate . Wood : Wood comes from living organisms- trees . Wood can be used for building many things , including houses . It is used for fuel and is the primary source of fuel in some parts of the world .",0

"How do you make a USB drive bootable ? I have a Sony Micro Vault 256MB HDD ( the stick kind that plugs into the USB port ) I want to make this bootable so I can use it to dump pre-built images using ghost . I need to know how to get it to format with the system info so I can boot directly from the device . Your BIOS must support booting from USB devices . On system startup you need to get into your BIOS ( usually F2 - check manufacturer 's specification ) , and find where you can specify the boot order . Select a low-numbered boot order item , and set it to USB-HDD ( if availble , otherwise another USB option ) . This may require several attempts until the right device option is found.Since most USB drives are ATAPI-compliant , your BIOS should detect it as if it were an external USB hard drive.Just make sure you specify a boot order BEFORE your internal hard drive ( usually HDD , or IDE0 ) , otherwise your system will always boot to the hard drive.Also , you need to format the USB drive as a bootable drive . If you can get the system to boot from a DOS , Windows or Linux floppy disk , you can try installing DOS , Windows 95/98 , or Linux ( Win2000 , and WinXP require more than 256Mb for sytem files ) . Your system will likely assign the USB drive as the C : & # 92 ; drive ( MAKE SURE THIS IS THE CASE BEFORE FORMATTING ! ! ! ) .Keep in mind that most USB drives are slower than hard drives , so performance may not be up to par . The newer `` high-speed '' drives are faster , but not comparable to a real hard drive.If no options work , your Micro Valut may not be ATAPI-compliant , or it 's USB-HDD firmware may not be compatible with your system . I had this happen with a SanDisk Cruzer mini , but a PNY Attache worked.If I may make one suggestion as well ... make a bootable CD with your images instead . CD 's are much more rugged , and can not be accidentally erased . Duplicates are EXTREMELY cheaper ( about 5 cents vs. $ 20 ) than the USB drive solution . Many more BIOS ' support booting from CD ( for about 10 years now ) , so compatibility is usually not an issue . All of the commercial CD-burning packages ( including most of the LITE versions ) support making bootable CD 's . The only trick is to make a bootable floppy that it can use to create the boot image on the CD .",0

I would like to find out more about how to read the Nutrition Facts on food , and how to decide which is a better choice . I know that the Cholesterol level and Saturated fat level is important . I 'm wondering if the Sodium has anything to do with Cholesterol.I also would like to know more about specific foods that are good to control and lover Cholesterol level ( like fish , chicken etc.. and how much I could eat of these healtier ones . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Soluble fiber is very good at lowering cholesterol as it binds the bile ( a digestive agent ) & causes you to excrete it . The body makes more bile ( to replace that which was lost - if it was n't lost , the body tends to recycle bile ) from cholesterol . You 'll find soluble fiber in foods such as apples , oranges & oatmeal . Insoluble fiber is also good for your heart , so eat high fiber foods like beans & veggies . Sodium does not affect your cholesterol level , but it can affect heart health so it 's best to keep it to a minimum . A little exercize , such as walking for 30 minutes 3 times a week , will also work wonders . If you eat a Whte bread , try to switch to something like Nature 's Own White Wheat , which has lots of fibre . Try & drink fat-free or 1 % milk instead of whole milk .

"World of Warcraft -- which class ? Hi ! what class out of mage and rogue do you think is the best ? i personally like rogue best , but lately i tried the mage , and it was kick butt . what do you think ? and what race ( and profession ) is the best for that class ? Both are played alot , and both do great damage . But I think later on it would be better to do Mage instead Rogue . A Mage will have an easier time finding a party for things like instances such as UBRS , LBRS , MC , ect . Human would be a good race because of the extra reputation they gain.. As far as profession , Enchanting is always good because either you can make gold off the enchanting supplies or enchanting other 's items or your own . Cloth working is another great profession beings you would wear cloth and you will be able to make yourself some awsome robes , ect later on . Mages are `` wtfpwn '' or so they say , also alot of fun ... I have alot of lvl 60 's on the Silvermoon server and Mage was always a fun class of mine , hardly anyone could beat me , as on my other alts I was hardly ever able to beat a Mage . If you ever go onto the Silvermoon server , I am always either on Druidess ( Druid ) on Alliance side or Kelpie ( Rogue ) on the Horde side . I 'm always willing to help . Just pick whatever you enjoy playing the most . All of them are fun in their own way.. and if you like to solo alot you would have an easier time on Rogue but later on when you want your class sets you would have an easier time as Mage to get them .",0

"how is the president of the united nations elected ? I think you 're referring to the position of UN Secretary General . There is no position as `` President of the U.N. '' The United Nations Secretary-General is the head of the Secretariat , one of the principal divisions of the United Nations . The Secretary-General is appointed to a five year term . UN Secretaries-General usually serves two consecutive terms , but sometimes only one . The U.N. Secretary General is chosen in two steps : The Security Council nominates a candidate to the U.N. General Assembly , which must then approve the selection by majority vote . In practice , the power to select a new Secretary General rests with the Security Council , since the General Assembly has never rejected its nominee . A successful candidate must have the backing of nine of the Security Council 's 15 member states , including all five permanent members ( Britain , China , France , Russia , and the U.S. ) . As a result , the selection is subject to the veto of any of the five permanent members of the Security Council . S/he is not elected by the citizens in direct voting.By convention , the position rotates by geographic region . And as of now , there has not yet been a Secretary-General from North America or Oceania .",0

"What are some good ways to stop smoking cigarettes. ? Methods of quittingCold Turkey methodNicotine Replacement Methods ( Patch , Gum , Nasal Spray ) Behavioral MethodsCognitive Therapy MethodOther Methods and adjuncts ( acupuncture , hypnosis , medications ) Factors for relapse while in the process of quittingPredictors of successful quittingCold turkey methodThis is the prefered method used by so called self changers , people who quit on their own and without any nicotine replacement by gum , patch or nasal spray . Little is known about this method as any research study would influence the results as it would no longer be a spontaneous process . Strong motivational factors are believed to play the foremost role in successful quitting using this method.Nicotine replacement therapyIn this method the nicotine delivered by the cigarette is replaced with nicotine delivered through the skin ( transdermal nicotine or nicotine patch ) , the nasal mucosa ( nicotine nasal spray ) or the buccal mucosa ( nicotine chewing gum ) . Several well designed clinical trials have shown the efficacy and safety of nicotine replacement the goal of which is to reduce cravings and ease withdrawal symptoms . Transdermal Nicotine Patches The nicotine patch is usually well tolerated , and provides constant , steady nicotine blood levels throughout the day and night when worn . They are quite simple to use , help prevent weight gain , cravings , and nicotine withdrawal symptoms and are socially acceptable Side Effects of the patch Patches may cause a local skin reaction , and insomnia with nightmares may occur . Overdosing in nicotine is possible , especially if a person smokes while wearing the patch . Smoking while wearing a patch is dangerous and may lead to stroke or heart attack . Use of the patch requires abstinence from tobacco products ... i.e . no smoking or chewing tobacco . Cost Patches are expensive and cost close to $ 100 per month of use . However bear in mind that smoking 1 ppd costs $ 1000 per year , which multipied by 10 years approximates the price of a car . Some people are tempted to cut the patch to save money . Nicoderm is the only patch that can be cut without destroying the patch 's ability to deliver nicotine through the skin to the bloodstream reliably.. It is not unsafe to cut the other patches as far as I know . However cutting the other patches impairs the transdermal drug delivery system , and may not provide reliable blood levels of nicotine . the key word here is reliable . The total dose of nicotine in the patch does not correlate at a milligram to milligram equivalency to the dose delivered to the bloodstream . The drug delivery system of the patch ensures that nicotine is transported thru the skin at a constant rate , and e ach manufacturer uses a different patented technology to do this . Only a portion of the total nicotine contained in the patch is transported thru the skin . Individual differences in skin thickness , location of the applied patch , and other related factors play a role in the total dose delivered . 3 Step Tapering Method of using the patch o The 21 mg patch is worn daily for 6-8 weeks for quitters who smoked an average of 1 ppd ( 2 ppd quitters may require 2 patches to alleviate cravings and withdrawal symptoms ) o The 14 mg patch is then worn daily for the next 2 to 4 weeks if the ex smoker remains confident in his or her ability to not smoke and if urges or cravings to smoke are controlled . o The 7 mg patch is then worn for 2-4 weeks if the same criteria as above are met . o In the absence of cravings and urge to smoke the patch is then stopped entirely . It is important to individualize the tapering method . . . Some people require longer periods of use , others shorter . If cravings intensify , return to the next higher dose of the patch .

It 's all a matter of trust . Obviously if you are freaking out about this , there is something about him or about your relationship with him that is making you suspicious in this situation .

"Which search engine is better and brighter ? My vote goes to Google.My answer is google for the following reasons : Pros of Google : As a seach engine , google has the best relevance and presents the results in a way that I find easy to decide what pages are best for me . Its the best in terms of researching information.For makin money , a # 1 on google is worth many times more than a # 1 on yahoo . Yahoo ! blocks the top of the SERPs with sponsored ads.Google also has a neat interface . Yahoo is not bad too , but its interface is not that neat . The reason for that being it to be a portal . I think a nice interface is very important since people will come back more often if so.The relevance of search results make its 'Feeling Lucky ' feature pretty useful . Firefox address bar by defaults goes to 1 site listed on your search results.Google has tried to stay away from Spam/ misleading sites better than other search engines.Cons of Google : However , few problems with google , its web crawler dose n't capture hyperlinks from PDF files stored on net , a feature which Yahoo provides.Also , Google at present does not provide an index for video aggregation through the web crawler , a feature which Altavista provided since 1999 . The problems include accuracy of the media file . That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.Due to a larger share of 'searching ' community , Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs .

The difference between yellow gold or white gold ( or silver ) is colour . There is not too much difference between white gold , silver , or platinum for that matter . It all comes down to price and prestige . The more you spend , the easier to show off with pride.Of course , the best place to start is in her own jewellery collection . Some people do n't like the look of yellow gold on themselves . Others say the same of silver . If you do n't have access to her jewellery collection , look at what she wears on a regular basis . Buy something that will match a piece she already wears.Do n't forget that you can add semi-precious gemstones to jewellery to add to its sparkle and visual appeal .

Namaste is sometimes mis-interpreted as a greeting associated with Yoga only , but it is much more widely used than that in South Asia , particularly in greeting elders . Moreover , it is used throughout Asia , especially in the context of Buddhism or Buddhist cultures , even though it is known by different names in some languages.Namaste is a Hindi word , and hence has widespread use in North India where Hindi and its dialects are the languages spoken . Gassho is the term used in Japanese contexts for the hand-gesture , and for the wider bowing , as a whole .

"Why is Windows noisy and Linux quiet ? Why does Windows grind away the hard drive when opening normal applications like an Internet browser or a word processor when those applications could easily fit into ( non-virtual ) memory alone ? What is so different about Linux/Unix that hard drive noise could be virtually eliminated ( when compared to Windows ) ? Linux/Unix stores files in an efficient manor , so your drive does n't have to keep jumping around to access the information that it needs .",0
"What is a PIC ( ? ) tube or insert ? My brother starts Chemo & radiation next week and they set up his feeding tube for when he needs it down the line . PIC stands for percutaneous intravenous catheter . Sometimes it is necessary to receive medicine or other fluids intravenously ( in the vein ) . If it is needed for a long period of time , the doctor might consider a PIC line as the best option . PIC lines are long , flexible tubes inserted into a large vein , usually near the elbow . The tube ( medically speaking , all tubes are called catheters ) is threaded up the vein until its tip reaches the large veins inside the chest.A PIC line can remain in place for several weeks or more . They are especially helpful for patients who need to receive medication at home for a long time . It is not uncomfortable . Most people have no trouble with them , and they can remain quite active while having one in place . PIC lines have bandages which are placed over the insertion site to make sure it does n't get accidentally tugged . This bandage has to be changed every day or two . A PIC line can be used for several kinds of injections , therefore , the patient does not have to be poked so many times .",0
"What should a 4 year old know before he enters kindergarten . He knows the alphabet and is ? very curious about numbers . Why is cutting and pasting so important ? I called my sister and asked her . She 's a kindergarten teacher . `` Knowing manners , sharing , waiting for a turn are all more important than knowing numbers and letters from day one . Knowing them helps , but they come to school to learn the numbers and letters . That 's what kindergarten is for . `` She recommends making sure your child is part of a playgroup or preschool at least once a week so he/she knows how to deal with other kids.Oh and cutting/pasting is for hand eye coordination and important brain development.I hope that helps .",0
"Who decides what is politically correct ? Support your answer please . Politically correct is a term that I think refers to respect for minorities . It 's basically a way of speaking that attempts to respect others by adopting the same language they use when referring to themselves , or the issues that are of most importance to them . It is a reflection of our national values of equality and equal rights.Because of the nature of opression , majority groups such as Men , Christians and Whites are usually much less affected by slurs , racism , etc , because they are not living with the legacy of discrimination and opression in the recent past.To answer the question , I would say that the minorities themselves would be the ones who decide what is and is not disrespectful , racist , or politically correct from their perspective.For example , many black people prefer to be called `` African Americans '' rather than black or negro or other such words . Some of those worlds have been used throughout our history and are strongly connected with opression and discrimination . Knowing this , we can choose to respect those wishes and adopt that speech , or we can reject it outright.Asian-Americans may feel that being called `` oriental '' is offensive to them , as the word has it has taken on a negative historical connotation , in books and spoken words throuought the years.Women might find it offensive to be called `` the little lady '' or `` girls '' , as this may harken back to a time when people thought of women as inferior to men or needing of male guidance , so they prefer to be called women.Basically I think that political correctness is a choice that you make to respect or disrespect minorities when you are discussing issues of race or gender in public .",0

"Do you believe that anyone who works and obeys the law should not have to live in poverty ? Many American families are stuck living below the poverty level ( $ 19,350 per year for a family of four ) . Depending upon the cost of living in any particular area , it takes from 2 - 4 times that amount to meet a family 's basic needs . It depends on how you mean to solve that problem . Do you mean that ( more ) money should be taken away from the working people , and given to those that do not work ( welfare ) ? Or do you mean employers should have to pay a livable wage ?

'' So they learn not to take the chance of hurting feelings or offending someone . Indirect communication is one of the best ways to do this . Also , women 's minds make connections more easily than men 's minds so what men may percieve as indirect may just mean that the woman is engaging in `` web '' thinking rather than the `` linear '' way in which most men think . To help you understand what she 's saying , it is a good idea to just ask questions . Make them non-threatening . A good example would be , `` Can you tell me more about that .

No one plan to Nuke the US specially Iranian , there are more Irani people in US than you can imagine , just go check your best universities like MIT or Stanford.The only attack to US has done by Bin Laden and if you know he was created by CIA in order to prevent Afghanestan to have a government like Iran and Iranian supported Anti Taliban groups in Afghanestan all the time that US was supporting them , and Iran government yelled that he is a murderer , its not Iranian fault.US do n't like Iran to be a nuclear power , its a fact but you must search the reason elsewhere , its not hollywood movies , its politics.A nuclear Iran will ruin all power equations in Middle East . Even they can force US to leave the territory . That 's the real reason.Iran has threatened Israel to wipe out of the map for 30 years and nothing actually has happened and will not happen.The main use of Nuke is n't military , its political , look at India and Pakistan , they declared they are both have nukes at the same time . they both have it but it was hidden , when one did a nuclear test the other one did it about a week .

About Iran and Israel there are many hidden facts that I 'm not in the mood to repeat ( if you really like to know them ask here or email me ) Anyways do n't worry , we will not nuke you , one who has to worry is me because once nice Americans attacked an Iranian AirBus which was full of civilan travelers and I 'm young and want to live long to see my grandchildren .",0
"what does an r3 code mean on a military dd214 in terms of re-enlistment ? It really depends on which branch of service you were in . In the Navy if you had an RE-3 it was usually followed with a letter code such as RE-3P which meant you got out on a physical . I got out with an RE-3Z which meant that I took SSB/VSI . As far as re-enlistment goes it really depends on the letter code that comes after . If you got an RE-3P for a shoulder injury and you want to come back in a few years after it heals ... maybe no problem . If you got out on a 3P for something more serious or dependancy ( drug/alcohol ) it seriously reduces your chances of re-enlistment . But do n't forget that each service has their own codes . So see your local recruiter first . The Marine Corps has only one code that is good for immediate re-enlistment ( RE-1A ) , anything other than that will keep you out of the Corps , but not necessarily out of the National Guard ( for example ) . If your particular RE code keeps you out of your original branch , check out other branches and do n't forget Guard and Reserves . Good luck in your military career .",0

"what are the complications of unrepaired severed flexor tendons ? Hello I severed the FDP tendon of my right pinky finger last May . I am an art student , an oil painter and was horrified by the procedure and typical results of the recommended surgery so I did not have it . My injury does not impair my abilities at all , however it can get painful sometimes ... I was wondering if I can expect more serious complications of leaving the tendon unrepaired in the future ? Dynamic splinting after flexor tendon injuries of the hand in childhood ] [ Article in German ] Fasching G , Schmidt B , Friedrich H , Mayr J.Kinderchirurgischen Abteilung , Preyersches Kinderspital , Wien.Ninety severed flexor tendons were repaired in 24 boys and 14 girls in a four-year-period at the Department of Pediatric Surgery in Graz . Mean age was 4.9 years . In 16 patients ( 42 % ) additional lesions were found . Direct repair was performed with modified techniques of Kirchmayr ( 23 ) or Kleinert ( 8 ) . In four fingers , flexor tendon reconstructions were carried out . Postoperatively , the dynamic Kleinert splint was used for early nonresistive motion , beginning on average on the second postoperative day . Intensive training of motion was performed in physiotherapeutic sessions during a mean period of five months , postoperatively . In five cases tenolysis was performed ; in one case a rupture of a sutured tendon had to be corrected . 27 patients ( 71 % ) with 42 injured fingers were followed-up on average 2.7 years after the operation . In accordance with the Buck-Gramcko classification , very good results were achieved in 37 cases ( 88 % ) , and a poor result in one patient ( 2 % ) . Atraumatic technique , dynamic splinting , consequent physiotherapeutic training by experienced physiotherapists , and well informed parents will yield excellent results after flexor tendon repair in the paediatric age group.PMID : 9746876 [ PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE ] ==================================================I read this and other pubmed articles on your condition and it seems to me that the younger you are , the better your chances of not having complications . Also , the splinting and stitch type is important . In all tendon repair , the zig zag cut with cross stitch seems prefered and the scaring is the main complication . Physical therapy to reduce and stretch scaring is as vital as finding the right doctor for the operation . If you choose not to have the operation , you can reduce your pain with physical therapy such as strengh training , and my favorite , nerve stimulation . Get a shoe box and fill it with rice , dry beans , bean bag beads or other small rounded material and run the injured hand through it for about five minutes three times a day . This increases the blood flow and stimulates the nerves . Its a good way to relax arthritic hands too.The tendons in your hand have little room for blood flow to aid healing . Hot parafin wax treatments help greatly to aid the opening of small capillaries.I injured my hand in a fall about 6 years ago and still have stiffness even after doing all of the above for a very long time . But then again , I am much older and have other ailments that interfere with my healing process.Good luck in what ever you decide to do .",0

"Do u think we have too many social programs paid for by government or do we need more ? Government needs less programs , that are more efficient , and to eliminate the pigs who suckle and abuse the programs.In my life time I have been on WIC and unemployment . Never abused either.I was in the military not making a lot of money and my wife could n't work , Dr 's orders . So we got on the WIC to get some extra milk and peanut butter , only cost government maybe a few hundred the whole time we were on.Unemployment was something I got after I left the military and couldnt get a job right away and had to pay rent . ONly cost the government a few thousand.I am a Republican . I voted for Bush in 2000 . I 'm not some crazy communist.I think the safety nets are neccessary for people and government exists to ensure that people do n't fall through the cracks.So lets just consolidate some of the things , get better service , and get rid of the abuse.I think most people would agree with that idea.Its sickening when you hear that welfare agencies are advertising that they need more people to go on welfare so they do n't lose the funding the next year .

"Should NiCADS get hot when they are in use ? ( NOT WHEN CHARGING ) ? When using a Modified 6V nicad ( use to be 4.8V ) it becomes very hot..probly about +70C . the system it drives is designed to automatically shut down when supply voltage drops ( Unsure what to ) reciently tested and found the drop from the 6V was as followsFully Charged = 7.55VShut down voltage = 5.89VHowever i have not modified the system in which it is used for so how is it that it is shutting down before the standard nicad voltage of 4.8V ? Have placed the Nicad in the freezer to see if dropping the temperature will allow me to re use the nicad in the system . Please help electronics ar n't my thing NiCads in general electronic applications are typically designed to NOT get hot , since the heat destroys the NiCad battery , can damage electronics and causes lawsuits when users get burned from the hot battery . Some devices like radio-controlled cars are high-drain applications that generate a lot of heat , so the batteries for these devices are designed for their specific use.Batteries get hot when they charge due to the high current going into them . The faster they charge , typically the hotter they get . When the battery discharges during use , the same thing happens , the battery gets hotter as more current is drawn from the battery . Without knowing anything else , my guess is that high current draw from the battery cells is causing them to heat up . This can be due to a defective battery , a battery not designed for the way you are using it or your modification damaged the battery or is otherwise causing excessive current drain.Also , increasing the supply voltage can drive more current through the device , so it may just be that the higher voltage is drawing more current.I ’ m not sure how the device is shutting down , so I can ’ t say why it ’ s doing that . Note that the voltage at which a device stops working is the voltage seen by the device itself . If you remove the battery from the device and measure the voltage , you will get a different voltage than if you measure the voltage at the precise moment the device shuts down . This is especially true for high current drain applications , which appears to be what ’ s happening with your batteries . Placing the NiCad ’ s in the freezer wo n't help . They ’ ll have to warm up to work properly anyway .",0
"what is lipoma and what types of procedures are used to remove it ? Lipomas are benign , slow-growing tumors that come from fat cells . They are not cancer . They are usually round , moveable , flattened lumps under the skin . They feel soft and doughy or rubbery . Lipomas usually grow in the neck , shoulders , back , or arms . They can occur at any age , but they often appear when you 're between 40 and 60 years of age . Sometimes they run in families . Sometimes they are caused by an injury . Most lipomasdo not hurt unless they are squeezed or bruised.Because lipomas are almost always benign ( not cancer ) , they usually do not need treatment . If they are painful or are growing quickly , you may want to have treatment . Treatment options include steroid shots , liposuction , or surgery . Your doctor can help you decide what is best for you.As always , check with your doctor to make sure it is a lipoma and to discuss treatment .",0

Also , there are many office workers in their middle age around 40 yrs old committing suicide . They are also usually very tired and stressed out under a great pressure at work . The trains in Tokyo often stop and delay because of the suicidal accidents . Workers commuting to work just get so depressed and there are ppl who just jump in to the rail while the train is coming . There are more and more help lines that they can call for help and talk to counselars . Like in high school , the school provides students listing of help lines . Teachers are pretty concerned about bullying at school . So Japaneses are very sensitive about suicide nowadays .",0

It 's the same as everywhere ; you or your b/f hurt her , you go to jail unless it 's self defense and you 'd better be able to prove it . I 'm a former police officer and if you attacked her , I would arrest you . What you need to do is to talk to the girl 's parents . She sounds obsessive and that can be dangerous . You need to document every offense , possibly video tape her doing it or recording her with a hidden tape recorder , which , in Texas , you can legally do as long as one party in the conversation is aware that it 's being taped , i.e . you or your boyfriend talking to her . If she shows up at your home , call the police . If her parents refuse to put a stop to it , go to the school principal if you are all in the same school and if need be , the police but do not lay a hand on her unless she attacks you . Where do you think sympathy might lie in a court of law ? With you and your b/f who are older , or what they would consider a child misbehaving ? Right or wrong , sympathy will be on her side because of her age . You both have to be the mature ones in this case . Do n't try to solve it on your own .

"What is Cancer ? Development of cancer , Types of treatment , effects of cancer Cancer is a disease of cells . It is an abnormal growth of cells which tend to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and , in some cases , to metastasize ( spread ) . Cancer is also called malignancy . A cancerous growth or tumor is sometimes referred to as a malignant growth or tumor . A non-malignant growth or tumor is referred to as benign . Benign tumors are not cancer . Cancer is not one disease . It is a group of more than 100 different and distinctive diseases . Cancer is NOT contagious.Cancer can involve any tissue of the body and have many different forms in each body area . Most cancers are named for the type of cell or organ in which they start . If a cancer spreads ( metastasizes ) , the new tumor bears the same name as the original ( primary ) tumor . The frequency of a particular cancer may depend on gender . While skin cancer is the most common type of malignancy for both men and women , the second most common type in men is prostate cancer and in women , breast cancer . Cancer frequency does not equate to cancer mortality . Skin cancers are often curable . Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer for both men and women in the United States today.Cancer is the Latin word for crab . The ancients used the word to mean a malignancy , doubtless because of the crab-like tenacity a malignant tumor sometimes seems to show in grasping the tissues it invades . Cancer may also be called malignancy , a malignant tumor , or a neoplasm ( literally , a new growth ) .TreatmentDevelopments in the treatment of cancer have led to greatly improved survival and quality of life for cancer patients in the past three decades . Traditionally , cancer has been treated by surgery , chemotherapy , and radiation therapy . In recent years immunotherapy has been added to that list . New drugs and techniques are constantly being researched and developed , such as antiangiogenic agents ( e.g. , angiostatin and endostatin ) , genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies , retinoid agents , and vaccine agents ( stimulating the immune system ) .",0

hair products and skin prouducts ? wat r the best hair products 2 use 2 get my hair thick again its already long and wat about skin i have some littelblack dots from bumps and i need them 2 go way and dont like proactive As far as skin goes : Try the Mary Kay skin care line with customized skin care products for acne . The best thing to with your skin is always to keep it clean as well as treating breakouts . This helps prevent breakouts . There are five steps to basic skin care : 1 . Cleanse2 . Exfoliate3 . Tone/Freshen4 . Moisturize5 . ProtectThe Mary Kay 3 in 1 cleanser can do the first three steps in one . The fifth step is protect . You want to use an oil free foundation which our formulas for dry normal combo and oily skin are all oil free . When your skin is protected with foundation you can wash off the impurities that your skin catches in the air . The foundation catches the irritants and impurities instead of them getting into your pores causing further breakouts . Mary Kay is satisfaction guaranteed . So if you try it and it doesnt work for you you can get different products or your money back . Also it is so important that when you are using skin care you use one line be it Mary Kay or Avon or a Walmart brand . They are formulated to work with one another . Mixing products not designed to work together can cause reactions in some people . ; ) To even out skin tone you of course need to keep your skin exfoliated but also use a solution like our day and night solution . The day solution has SPF 25 in it and the Night Solution has Vitamin A and E and more in them . These collagen inducing products help to tighten and firm the skin as well as even out tone . You can add in our Microdermabrasion once or twice a week to totally exfoliate and remove dead skin . The second step of our microderm set will return your skin to its proper PH balance so you will not be rough or dry afterwards . I reccomend using products as follows but all skin care must be customized for an individual.Timewise 3 in 1 Cleanser ( customized for skin type ) Timewise Day Solution ( at night use Night Solution ) Timewise Moisturizer ( customized for skin type ) Timewise Firming Eye creamAdditional moisturizers if needed ( intense for dry spots etc ) Foundation ( customized for skin type and shade ) Color products ( use all oil free and non-comedogenic ) Hope this was helpful ! !

"Should car be banned in city centre ? Please give me the reason and more details because I need to write a arguement essay on it . Well , there are two sides to this issue - I do n't know if you are arguing in favor , or against it - so here goes.On the plus side ( i.e . banning cars in the city center ) , you would reduce traffic , congestion , wear and tear on the streets . You could hold events ( parades , celebrations , rally 's , etc . ) in the area without significantly affecting traffic . Also , car-free areas in the downtown ( i.e . city center ) can help to revitalize an area of the downtown - it can be made to look nice , maybe with something like nice bricks , or cobblestones.On the other hand ( against banning cars in the city center ) , if you ban cars in the downtown area , you 'll be loosing revenue from on-street parking and any parking tickets the city issues , depending upon the size of the car-free area , it will be more difficult to get to the city center , it might adversely affect sales for businesses in the affected area.One option , used in downtown Minneapolis ( Nicollet Mall ) allows taxis and busses , but not private ( i.e . car ) traffic . This allows people to get down to the area via public transportation , or by taking a taxi .

"May I Know which Organ Produces Blood PLasma ? I need it for school homework before 2 Febuary plz ! ! ! ! ! ! ! No organ produces Blood Plasma , it is a product of several organs or one could say the body . It consists of ( mostly ) water , salts ( electrolytes ) , and proteins ( albumin and antibodies being the majority ) . All the water , salts , and proteins ultimately are derived from the GI tract ; i.e. , what you eat . The water and salts are regulated by the renal system . Albumin is produced by the liver ( and it is in the majority for plasma protein ) and antibodies are a product of the immune system . There is also a balance of proteins and water within the vasculature ( intravascular space ) and without ( extravascular space ) . So , there is always an influx/efflux balance between your tissues and the vasculature depending on the osmostic pressure ( mostly ) and mechanical pressure . This is all in one giant balance or homeostasis most of the time . Hence , why it 's a good idea to see plasma as a total body product.I just read the above answers . Plasma is NOT produced in the bone marrow . Blood cells are produced in the marrow . Plasma is what you have left over when you remove those cells .",0

"can sata and pata raid work at the same time , so in `` my computer '' all the drives show up as a single space ? If you mean , can you combine both SATA and PATA drives in a single RAID , then the answer is yes , but not a hardware RAID.There are two kinds of RAID -- hardware and software . Hardware RAID is implemented by a hardware RAID controller , which is either part of your motherboard , or an add-in card . Software RAID is implemented by the operating system . Software RAID is slower than hardware RAID , but if you have a reasonably fast processor , it 's not using terribly much slower . If you have a slow processor , it will be slower , and more importantly , it will put a big load on your processor and make everything run slowly.To the best of my knowledge , there are no RAID controllers that will RAID an SATA drive with a PATA drive , but you can set up whatever RAID you want with software RAID . If you already have your drives in hardware RAID ( and intend to keep them that way ) then when you do this , you will be RAIDing the already-existing hardware RAIDs , since a hardware RAID is treated as a single drive on the `` software level '' .Here 's some info on software RAID in Windows : http : //www.techimo.com/articles/index.pl ? photo=149Here 's some info on software RAID in GNU/Linux : http : //www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.htmlHere 's some info on software RAID in Mac OS X : http : //www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/softraid3.htmlYou can find abundant info on doing software RAID on these and other operating systems by entering `` software RAID '' together with name of the operating system in a search engine .",0

"who will allocate memory for Objects in Java ? Will the memory be allocated before compilation ? That depends on how you run your Java programs . Since you say `` compilation '' , I assume you 're actually building them into executable form.Memory is allocated in real-time , that is , when an object is instantiated , that is when the memory is allocated by the system . Say you have an object that is created only after you enter your name . When the program starts , the object is not in memory . Once you enter your name , the object will create , and the system will allocate the necessary memory.Remember that with Java , when you `` delete '' an object , it does n't always fall immediately out of the memory stack . The Garbage Collection routine will occasionally filter through and `` de-allocate '' all those homeless memory pointers .",0

"what are nephillims ( ? ) are they the offspring of the fallen angels ? The Nephilim ( fallen ones , giants ) were the offspring of sexual relationships between the sons of God and daughters of men in Genesis 6:1-4 . There is much debate as to the identity of the `` sons of God '' ( see our article on this subject here ) . I believe the correct view is that they were fallen angels ( demons ) who mated with human females and/or possessed human males and then mated with human females . These unions resulted in offspring that were `` heroes of old , men of renown '' ( Genesis 6:4 ) . What were the Nephilim ? According to Hebrew and other legends ( the Book of Enoch and other non-Biblical writings ) , they were a race of giants and super-heroes who did acts of great evil . Their great size and power likely came from the mixture of demonic `` DNA '' with human genetics . All that the Bible directly says about them is that they were `` heroes of old , men of renown '' ( Genesis 6:4 ) . The Nephilim were not aliens , they were literal , physical beings produced from the union of the sons of God and daughters of men ( Genesis 6:1-4 ) .",0

"Any economists out there ? Student who needs help ! ! ? I 'm in college , & need help with my macroeconomics class . I took a quiz , and got 5 questions wrong . My teacher is disputing that they 're wrong , but I say they 're right ! ! Thank you in advance for your help . The questions are : The ability-to-pay tax principle ca n't be applied to : ( she said the correct answer was welfare ) . The ability to pay tax principle states that : Those with a greater ability to pay ( such as those with a higher income , or those who own more property ) should pay more taxes . I do n't see how welfare ( or her other choices of post office , & highway ) fit into this principle . Yes , we as users of the highway & post offices pay taxes , ( these services are supplied by the government ) but people that use welfare also pay taxes . The only way I can see this to be a part of it , is that highways can make money by tolls & post offices by postage , & welfare is giving money away to citizens . Thank you , and I have 4 more , but no space to post , so I 'm going to do individual questions . Welfare is essentially a negative tax , which goes right in hand with the ability-to-pay tax principle . They so lack an ability to pay that they are instead paid by the Social Security Insurance tax that everyone who can pay does .",0

"why did dr. king want a change ? what part of society did dr. king want to change ? Just wanted to add another note ... ... .Have you heard his speech where he talks of getting stabbed by the woman at the book signing ? The blade came so very very close to his aorta that the media reported that if he had sneezed , he would have died . So in his speech he spoke of all of the many things he would have missed out on had he sneezed . It was such a positive speech as he noted all of the changes in the world he was already witnessing . He ends the speech by saying just how glad he was that he had not sneezed . How unfortunate it is that he was prevented from seeing where we are so very many years later . Would he be proud of us ? Or would he still hope for more from the world ?",0
"What is the difference b/w endolymph & perilymph in human ear ? Endolymph- watery fluid in the membranous labyrinth of the ear.Perilymph- watery fluid between the membranous and bony labyrinths of the ear.The perylimph is similar but not identical in composition to extracellular fluids of the body , such as cerebrospinal fluid . The concentration of sodium ions in the perylimph is high ( about 150 milliequivalents per litter ) and that of potassium ions is low ( about 5 milliequivalents per litter ) .Endolymph is a totally unique extracellular fluid , which ion composition is unlike anywhere in the body . Potassium ions major in endolymph and virtually no sodium . Because endolymph is unlike any other , the processes which are maintained and regulated can not be extrapolated by other fluid system . The total ion content of endolymph is significantly higher than that of perilymph .",0

"what is ocx ? Short for OLE Control Extension , an independent program module that can be accessed by other programs in a Windows environment . OCX controls end with a .ocx extension . OCX controls represent Microsoft 's second generation of control architecture , the first being VBX controls written in Visual Basic . A component software technology from Microsoft that enables a Windows program to add functionality by calling ready-made components . Generally called `` OLE controls '' or `` OLE custom controls , '' they appear to the end user as just another part of the program.OCXs are Microsoft 's second-generation component architecture . Unlike first-generation 16-bit Visual Basic controls ( VBXs ) , which were only written in Visual Basic , OCXs can be written in several languages and come in 16-bit and 32-bit versions . OCXs were renamed ActiveX controls and continue to use the .OCX file extension . Both VBX and OCX controls have now been superseded by ActiveX controls . However , ActiveX is backward compatible with OCX controls , which means that ActiveX containers , such as Microsoft 's Internet Explorer , can execute OCX components .",0
"Why should high school teenagers do their best in school ? What benefits will they get out of it ? I can tell you just how important it is to do well in high school and make sure to take all the courses you can.When i was in high school , i floated around and didnt spend enough time on my studies . The result was that i graduated with the bare minimum grades and classes of course . I went into college at age 17 , and did not understand why everybody was 24-25 years old . They told me that they didnt think education was important so they went to work after high school . I didnt listen to them . Now at age 24 , i had to redo or do classes i didnt complete in high school to get back into college and university that i should have done in high school . I wasted precious time in my life and could have been a doctor by now if i had put effort into high school . Please dont make the same mistake i did , be diligent in your studies , you will no regret it . Education will no guarantee a good salary but you can use every bit of luck to do well in this life and education will increase your chances to do that . good luck !",0

"where do southern natives get there accent from . and why do the black people speak different from the white ? By Southern natives , I take it you mean people born and raised in the southern United States ? Many if not most of the original European settlers in that part of the country were from Scotland , Ireland or Wales . This mixed with both African influences and a stand-offishness to the more British speakers of the north eventually lead to the Southern American English ( SAE ) form of speech . Although most African Americans spoke similar to their white counterparts until very recently , an upsurge in differentiation started in the 1950 ’ s and 1960 ’ s which soon separated the speech patterns of many .",0

"why would a wife rather run with male friends than to spend time with her husband and family ? I have always worked hard and the jobs took me away from home alot . The last one I was mobilized to Iraq . Of which I was sent back home early due to a child custody problem . My wife had ( by power of attorney ) custody of my children from another woman . That woman showed up to the house and now I am here . Once all the military crap was completed and I was discharged from active duty , We had spoke about allof the above and she had stated that she felt confined . That she had no friends anymore . I tild her that she could go out with friends every once in awhile . That ended up to be every night m-th at a bar until it closed and f-sa at one ( a males ) house to play cards . For the most part I believe as such was going on , , , but now how can a male friend of hers who understands why I would chase after to find my wife and ask her to come home and not stay out all the time allow her to move in with him with our children.. ? ? ? It sounds like she has no respect for you and has no consideration for your feelings . Why would you want to be with a woman like this ? Would she be so understanding if you were spending your free time with another woman ? You need to take charge of the situation and put your foot down let her know that this is unacceptable behavior and if she refuses to put a stop to it you know that she is not the one for you . Ultimately the decision is yours do you want to live this way and if she is not looking out for your childrens best interest than maybe you need to .",0

"why are people so ignorant about the Pagan based religions or witchcraft ? Well , you are certain to get a bunch of Christians jumping on this one , which may be an answer in itself . Much ignorance is due to having a different point of view ( usually christian , but perhaps other `` standard '' religions as well ) that prevents you from seeking real facts.Secondly , the pagan mysteries have long protected themselves , hiding behind symbols , misdirection and so on , because of persecution . Remember the burning times ! ( i.e. , the inquisition . ) Also , I think many modern pagans , witches , wicca , ( use what term you will ) , believe that only a small percentage of people are capable of being a part of the pagan world : one might almost call it snobbery . Think of Malfoy and his contempt for anyone who is not born a `` pureblood '' witch or wizard . You think Rawlings pulled that out of pure imagination ?

Info from Wikipedia : William Tyndale ( sometimes spelled Tindale ) ( ca.1484 - October 6 , 1536 ) was a 16th century priest and scholar who translated the Bible into the Early Modern English of his day . Although numerous partial and complete English translations had been made from the 7th century onward , Tyndale 's was the first to take advantage of the new medium of print , which allowed for its wide distribution . Later , in October 1536 , he was killed by strangulation and then burned at the stake.Much of Tyndale 's works eventually found its way to the King James Version , which , though the work of 54 independent scholars , is based primarily on Tyndale 's translations.For more information follow this link : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tyndale",0

"How can I get back together with my ex-wife ? Our split up was due to a really bad situation . No adultery involved . However the tust was shattered ! Not knowing the details , it is tough to answer , but there are various types of women out there , and for some , trust is everything . If you did enough to make her leave you , it must have been pretty bad . I would assume ( since I do n't know the circumstances ) that either there have always been trust issues , or that your infidelity ( of whichever type ) was long standing and ongoing , and so she felt betrayed . In both cases , I do n't know if there is anything you could do . If she left because of pure emotional reaction , you might have a chance , but if it was an intellectual decision , it is not likely to work . Emotion can be reasoned with - an overreaction can be dealt with , but logic is usually rock solid . You could offer therapy for you both , however if you are already 'divorced ' , it seems a little too final to try that . Apologies alone wo n't really get you anywhere . Not much of an answer , but without any details , it 's the best I 've got . My main advice though is to know when to give up . Some battles ca n't be won .

One could say , however , that the Mexican-American War was merely a pretext for taking all of the territory , and it is likely not far from the truth .

"Most gelogists think that the movement of Earth 's plates is caused by what ? a. gravityb . subductionc . convection currentsd .

These currents are thought to provide force to cause the motion of the oceanic plates , either directly , or indirectly through the mid ocean ridge building process . Subduction is only one part of the process of plate tectonics , that does provide some driving force by pulling the subducting plate downward . Gravity has a role as well , as without gravity , the mid-ocean ridges would not have the weight to provide force with which to push the plates apart at the spreading centers , and the subducting plates would not have the force to pull plates . The earth 's magnetic field may have the least to do with plate tectonics , possibly no role at all .",0

A dry joint can be fixed using a soldering iron , and a bit of solder . Although you do have to know where it is , and be able to access that area .

"How do you bind a vampire or a werewolf ? Aside from holy water , garlic , etc. , what do the myths say ? If werewolves can be killed with a silver bullet , with what material do you capture them alive ? Do plain metal chains work ? Or do they have to be made of certain materials ? The Slavs ( from around the year 300 ) believed that vampires were afraid of silver ( but could n't be killed with it ) and that one could kill them by cutting their head off and placing it between their legs , or by stabbing them with a wooden stake in the heart . During the Middle Ages , the myth transformed a bit . People used holy water , wooden stake , and cross to kill a vampire ( we can see the influence of the Christianity here ) . If people suspected that a dead person has turned into a vampire , they would dig them out and stick a stake into the heart . This was n't meant to kill the vampire but to bind it to the grave . Serbs believed that every single drop of blood had to be destroyed or else the vampire would still be `` alive '' ( they were more or less living corpses , but you get my point ) so they used to burn the vampire after that . Then butterflies would fly out of the vampire and people had to kill each one of them . Garlic can only scare the vampire because of its strong and unpleasant smell . In order to stop the vampire 's visits at night , people would hang garlic near every hole in the house ( for example keyhole , chimney , windows ... , because people believed that the vampire could enter the house even through the smallest hole ) . One could also throw some seeds before the vampire , since they had to stop and count them all . I 'm not really sure how they used to capture them . I know vampires could be captured by stealing that cloth they had over them in the grave , but I have seen this only in vampire stories . But in reality , people were just killing them and they were probably too scared to just capture them ( that 'd be pointless , would n't it ) . Although in Asia there were some kinds of vampires which people used to capture and then keep them in wooden cages and feed them eggs : P I have n't heard of any captured werewolves either .

"The Practice of Tithing : for today ? Is the practice of Tithing as described in the Old Testament Laws , and Malachi still to be practiced by Gentile Christians and/or Israeli Christians today , or has the new covenant practice of Giving cheerfully out of ones abundance and ability , as mentioned in II Corinthians replaced the old way ? Can a church today survive without a legalistic tenth of the congregations income , relying only on the abundant non percentage giving of those who are willing and able ? You are correct , it is unbiblical for a preacher to require members to tithe of income . Also tithing was always food never money and the tithe was always eaten by the tither . Read Deut . 12 and 14 . Can a church survive ? Yes but not as a mega church . the churches would be smaller and be more quality than quantity ( Jesus himself only had twelve apostles ) . Eliminate tithing and the pastor is forced to live by faith , not many of them want to do that though.Our church does not believe in tithing of income nor do I take an offering ( some do give anyway ) . When God decides it is time to close up then we will close up . All churches should run on faith not business tactics . The only thing most pastors have faith in is their ability to con their members out of more money.And in Malachi when it mentions will a man rob God ( preachers love that one ) no one mentions that this is written to the Levitical priests Mal 2:1 . It was the priests stealing the tithe from the tithers . It must be an honest mistake that they forgot this . lol . Malachi 3:8 ties in with I Samuel 2:12-17 . There were corrupt priests stealing then and there are corrupt preachers stealing now . I can hear the lake of fire calling for them now .

"what is the differece between a 5 port router and a 5 port switch ? First you need to know th differnce . To understand the difference between a router and a switch you need to understand the ISO model.ISO/OSI Network ModelThe standard model for networking protocols and distributed applications is the International Standard Organization 's Open System Interconnect ( ISO/OSI ) model . It defines seven network layers . Layer 1 - Physical Physical layer defines the cable or physical medium itself , e.g. , thinnet , thicknet , unshielded twisted pairs ( UTP ) . All media are functionally equivalent . The main difference is in convenience and cost of installation and maintenance . Converters from one media to another operate at this level . Layer 2 - Data Link Data Link layer defines the format of data on the network . A network data frame , aka packet , includes checksum , source and destination address , and data . The largest packet that can be sent through a data link layer defines the Maximum Transmission Unit ( MTU ) . The data link layer handles the physical and logical connections to the packet 's destination , using a network interface . A host connected to an Ethernet would have an Ethernet interface to handle connections to the outside world , and a loopback interface to send packets to itself . Ethernet addresses a host using a unique , 48-bit address called its Ethernet address or Media Access Control ( MAC ) address . MAC addresses are usually represented as six colon-separated pairs of hex digits , e.g. , 8:0:20:11 : ac:85 . This number is unique and is associated with a particular Ethernet device . Hosts with multiple network interfaces should use the same MAC address on each . The data link layer 's protocol-specific header specifies the MAC address of the packet 's source and destination . When a packet is sent to all hosts ( broadcast ) , a special MAC address ( ff : ff : ff : ff : ff : ff ) is used . Layer 3 - Network NFS uses Internetwork Protocol ( IP ) as its network layer interface . IP is responsible for routing , directing datagrams from one network to another . The network layer may have to break large datagrams , larger than MTU , into smaller packets and host receiving the packet will have to reassemble the fragmented datagram . The Internetwork Protocol identifies each host with a 32-bit IP address . IP addresses are written as four dot-separated decimal numbers between 0 and 255 , e.g. , 129.79.16.40 . The leading 1-3 bytes of the IP identify the network and the remaining bytes identifies the host on that network . The network portion of the IP is assigned by InterNIC Registration Services , under the contract to the National Science Foundation , and the host portion of the IP is assigned by the local network administrators , locally by noc @ indiana.edu . For large sites , usually subnetted like ours , the first two bytes represents the network portion of the IP , and the third and fourth bytes identify the subnet and host respectively . Even though IP packets are addressed using IP addresses , hardware addresses must be used to actually transport data from one host to another . The Address Resolution Protocol ( ARP ) is used to map the IP address to it hardware address . Layer 4 - Transport Transport layer subdivides user-buffer into network-buffer sized datagrams and enforces desired transmission control . Two transport protocols , Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) and User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) , sits at the transport layer . Reliability and speed are the primary difference between these two protocols . TCP establishes connections between two hosts on the network through 'sockets ' which are determined by the IP address and port number . TCP keeps track of the packet delivery order and the packets that must be resent . Maintaining this information for each connection makes TCP a stateful protocol . UDP on the other hand provides a low overhead transmission service , but with less error checking . NFS is built on top of UDP because of its speed and statelessness . Statelessness simplifies the crash",0

"What is a Rife Generator and how does it work ? I 'll post here my answer that I gave when another person asked the same question a month or so ago.The Rife machine is legit depending on what model or manufacturer you got it from . There was a company in the late 80 's to early 90 's called LER that made what they named the REM SuperPro Generator . Though I ca n't vouch for any of the newer models , I can say that Rife 's technology was right on if you can find an original model.YES it shattered cancer cells , YES he was heralded as having found the cure for all diseases , YES he had 100 % success rate on the patients in the Pasadena county hospital . A Rife machine uses scalar waves , along the now established fact that every organism operates at its own distinct frequency . By increasing the resonance , a particular organism can be destroyed without harming the tissue around it . Rife meticulousy recorded the M.O.R . ( mortal oscillatory rate ) for the thousands of micro-organisms he could see under his universal microscope . A properly built Rife frequency generator can not hurt , except for a brief healing crisis , followed by an incredible feeling of health and well-being taken from years of testimonials ( unless you have a pacemaker from what I 've heard ) . A good amount of reading on Rife 's story can be found at some of the links below.Unfortunately most of his work was destroyed because of the newly created AMA and FDA that came into power . They ruled Rife 's work did not fall under their now established guidelines for medical practice , and with the government to back them up , it was the end for his discovery .",0
"why some people are gay ? I wish I could say I read Phillips answer , but I could n't maintain focus . So , risking repeating elements of his analysis , I 'm going to give this question a stab , but with a biological/evoluationary bent.Evolutionary arguments have been offered for male homosexuality . For example , Symons ( 1979 ) argues that homosexuality results from a meme that takes advantage of the inborn male propensity to find sexual variety interesting . Normally this propensity would be adaptive because it would encourage males to attempt sexual relations with many women , which would result in more offspring . But a meme could parasitize this propensity , redirecting sexual interest to non-adaptive objects , as in fetishism or homosexuality . Epigenetic arguments have been inspired by work on pre-natal hormones . Dîrner and his colleagues ( cited in LeVay 1994 ) link stress during pregnancy to hormonal effects on the fetus that would lead to homosexuality . This could be part of a mother 's adaptive reproductive strategy . That is , in times of stress , when it is difficult to raise children , it may be adaptive to have some homosexual children who could help their siblings raise offspring instead of having offspring of their own.Memic and epigenetic arguments may explain some aspects of homosexuality , such as the cultural variations in practices or identities , or specific behaviors of homosexuals ( femininity for example ) . However , the biological studies of homosexuality , together with the extraordinary cross-cultural similarities of exclusive homosexuals ( Whitam 1983 ) suggest that some aspects of homosexuality ( e.g . orientation ) are at least partly determined by genes.The basic problem for genetic explanations of homosexuality is to account for how a gene that does not lead to offspring could survive the pressures of natural selection . One possibility is that a maladaptive gene for homosexuality might re-occur repeatedly in a population if it results from the frequent mutation of a gene that is normally adaptive . However , people with maladaptive genes rarely exceed 1 % of the population , while male homosexuality apparently occurs much more frequently ( Whitam and Mathy 1986 ; Gadpaille 1980 ; Diamond 1993 ) . Another possibility is that a recessive gene for homosexuality might have advantages that allow it to pass on to future generations . For example , homosexuals could directly help their relatives ( who share the recessive gene ) raise more children . This `` kin selection '' hypothesis predicts more homosexuality in those societies where homosexuals could most help their relatives ( for example , in endogamous societies where homosexuals would live nearby ) . Nevertheless , cross-cultural research shows that this is not the case ( Werner 1979 ) . Another possibility is that a homosexual gene itself , when combined with non-homosexual genes , may provide reproductive advantages . This latter scenario is sometimes known as the `` heterozygous '' hypothesis , although it is really about any type of gene combination ( LeVay 1994 ; Sommer 1990 ) . The heterozygous argument suggests that homosexuality results from genes for submissive behavior . An animal possessing only submissive genes would fail to reproduce for lack of trying . But an animal possessing only genes for dominance would also fail to reproduce because it would get killed for taking too many risks . It is the `` heterozygous '' males , who would most likely pass on their genes . By the genetic laws of probability , this would leave every generation with a certain percentage of individuals at the extremes . For example , if each of a pair of chromosomes had only one `` homosexual '' locus with only two possible alleles ( one for dominance and one for submissiveness ) this would leave a heterozygous couple with 25 % of their offspring homozygous for submissiveness , 50 % heterozygous , and 25 % homozygous for dominance . If , however , homosexuality were the result of the interaction of five ge",0

"Can infinite be a finite measurement ? There are many concepts of infinity , some poetic , some mathematic . In math its a pretty definite concept , poetically its just mind-boggling large . `` If you remove a part from infinity or add a part to infinity , still what remains is infinity '' . So what happens if you have one infinity , and remove bits of it to create another infinitity separated by a small space ? You 'd probably end up with two infinities , which means the concept has to be finite.So as an amount , its indefinite , but as a concept , especially as a singularity in math , has a definite meaning ( measurement was too confusing ) .For example , in trigonometry tan 90° = ∞ , and arctan ∞ = +/- 90° . So while the actual value of ∞ is unknown , the value itself has meaning .",0
"do you think books & documents are banned so the government can try to hide the truth ? The truth is out there.What else is the government trying to hide . What are you talking about ? Clearly there are some national security reasons to make some things difficult to locate . Yes , it is certainly true that national security is sometimes used where it shouldn ’ t be use . However the recourse for such actions is public access to records and application can be made for anything . If the government wants to keep it for only a high security clearance , then it must demonstrate that necessity in a court.Banning of books generally occurs at the local level in the local school or library . In both of these situations there is recourse to get such decisions reversed . A relatively few things should fall under banning acts . For example , pornographic pictures and writings kept from those who are too young.What specifically are you referring to ?

"Why is American tax day on April 15th ? Who started the day and why is n't on that specific day ? And how many years has it been that way ? The Sixteen Amendment which allows the enforcement of taxes was passed by Congress on February 13 , 1913 . They chose March 1 , 1914 as the filing deadline for taxes . This deadline was changed to March 15 in 1918 , and in 1955 it was changed to April 15 . `` According to an IRS spokesman , the move `` spread out the peak workload , '' but there 's another explanation . Turns out that as the income tax applied to more of the middle class , the government had to issue more refunds . `` Pushing the deadline back gives the government more time to hold on to the money , '' says Ed McCaffery , a University of Southern California law professor and tax guru . Still , the IRS 's rigidity works in your favor : By law , it must mail your refund within 45 days or pay you interest . ''",0

"Dose the moon orbit the sun ? If we just look at the sun , earth , moon system , all three bodies orbit the center of mass of this 3-body system . Since the sun is much more massive than the other two bodies , the location of the center of mass of this system is inside the sun , so the sun moves very little , while the earth and moon appear to orbit the sun.Now , the earth and the moon also interact gravitationally , and they orbit the center of mass of the earth moon system The center of mass of this earth-moon system is located inside the earth , so the moon looks like it orbits the earth . You can view the earth and moon as being in orbit around their center of mass , and the earth-moon system center of mass being in orbit around the earth-sun-moon system.If the sun , earth , moon had equivalent masses , and if there were no other gravity bodies in the universe , they would appear to have orbits around the center of mass of this smaller earth , moon , sun system.I think the term '' orbit '' can be a little confusing because it 's not always clearly defined . The gravitational attraction of the sun on the moon is greater than the earth 's attraction on the moon , so you could also argue that the moon really orbits the sun , with it 's orbit modified by the earth .",0

"What really distinguishes AJAX programming from traditional web programming ( html/javascript ) ? AJAX uses a bit of javascript that uses the XmlHTTP object . This object , opens up a connection to a Web server , transmits and receives data , then calls back the javascript on the page which was used to invoke it.What this means is that changes on the client side can communicate with the server , then dynamically update the client user interface without having to request a new Web page from the server.While this slightly complicates developing Web applications that use AJAX technologies ( which , by the way , is just a name given to the various technologies employed to use this methodology ) , it makes for a very smooth user experience since they are not constantly refreshing Web pages.AJAX applications give an appearance of a 'thick client ' application while still being a 'thin client ' ( i.e . application that runs in a Web browser . ) However , it is important to note that network communication is still going on in the background while the application is being used .",0

"Why does metal spark in the microwave ? The short answer is : Microwaves bombard the metal with radio waves ( electrons ) . Where that energy builds up , it can build to the point the energy will arc to another spot . Works great with crumpled foil , or CD-ROM 's you do n't want to use anymore . Quoth Wikipedia : `` ... the pointed ends of the fork will act to concentrate the electric field formed at the tips . This has the effect of exceeding the dielectric breakdown gradient of air , about 3 megavolts per meter ( 3×106V/m ) , causing sparks to form . This effect is directly analogous to the effect of St. Elmo 's fire. '' P.S . According to Mythbusters , you CAN NOT damage your microwave by putting metal objects in it for short periods of time . You would have to microwave metal a LOT for it to overload the magnetron and cause damage ( most magnetrons in consumer microwaves have overload protection anyway ) . Try microwaving a CD you do n't need anymore upside-down in your microwave for 2-5 seconds , and watch the miracle of radio lithography ( just do n't do it to the point the plastic melts , or who knows what kind of toxic fumes you might release from the plastic ) .",0

"What is the theory of relativity ? I have gotten mixed information on this subject , and would like to know the truth . Any resources would be great . Wellrelativity Physical theory , introduced by Albert Einstein , that discards the concept of absolute motion and instead treats only relative motion between two systems or frames of reference . One consequence of the theory is that space and time are no longer viewed as separate , independent entities but rather are seen to form a four-dimensional continuum called space-time . Full comprehension of the mathematical formulation of the theory can be attained only through a study of certain branches of mathematics , e.g. , tensor calculus . Both the special and general theories have been established and accepted into the structure of physics . Einstein also sought unsuccessfully for many years to incorporate the theory into a unified field theory valid also for subatomic and electromagnetic phenomena.Evolution from Classical TheoryThe modern theory is an extension of the simpler Galilean or Newtonian concept of relativity , which holds that the laws of mechanics are the same in one system as in another system in uniform motion relative to it . Thus , it is impossible to detect the motion of a system by measurements made within the system , and such motion can be observed only in relation to other systems in uniform motion . The older concept of relativity assumes that space and time are correctly measured separately and regards them as absolute and independent realities . The system of relativity and mechanics of Galileo and Newton is perfectly self-consistent , but the addition of Maxwell 's theory of electricity and magnetism to the system leads to fundamental theoretical difficulties related to the problem of absolute motion .",0

The Last Farewell ( English version of Mi Ultimo Adios ) by Jose RizalFarewell , my adored Land , region of the sun caressed , Pearl of the Orient Sea , our Eden lost , With gladness I give you my Life , sad and repressed ; And were it more brilliant , more fresh and at its best , I would still give it to you for your welfare at most.On the fields of battle , in the fury of fight , Others give you their lives without pain or hesitancy , The place does not matter : cypress laurel , lily white , Scaffold , open field , conflict or martyrdom 's site , It is the same if asked by home and Country.I die as I see tints on the sky b'gin to showAnd at last announce the day , after a gloomy night ; If you need a hue to dye your matutinal glow , Pour my blood and at the right moment spread it so , And gild it with a reflection of your nascent light ! My dreams , when scarcely a lad adolescent , My dreams when already a youth , full of vigor to attain , Were to see you , gem of the sea of the Orient , Your dark eyes dry , smooth brow held to a high planeWithout frown , without wrinkles and of shame without stain.My life 's fancy , my ardent , passionate desire , Hail ! Cries out the soul to you , that will soon part from thee ; Hail ! How sweet 't is to fall that fullness you may acquire ; To die to give you life , 'neath your skies to expire , And in your mystic land to sleep through eternity ! If over my tomb some day , you would see blow , A simple humble flow'r amidst thick grasses , Bring it up to your lips and kiss my soul so , And under the cold tomb , I may feel on my brow , Warmth of your breath , a whiff of your tenderness.Let the moon with soft , gentle light me descry , Let the dawn send forth its fleeting , brilliant light , In murmurs grave allow the wind to sigh , And should a bird descend on my cross and alight , Let the bird intone a song of peace o'er my site.Let the burning sun the raindrops vaporizeAnd with my clamor behind return pure to the sky ; Let a friend shed tears over my early demise ; And on quiet afternoons when one prays for me on high , Pray too , oh , my Motherland , that in God may rest I.Pray thee for all the hapless who have died , For all those who unequalled torments have undergone ; For our poor mothers who in bitterness have cried ; For orphans , widows and captives to tortures were shied , And pray too that you may see your own redemption.And when the dark night wraps the cemet'ryAnd only the dead to vigil there are left alone , Do n't disturb their repose , do n't disturb the mystery : If you hear the sounds of cittern or psaltery , It is I , dear Country , who , a song t'you intone.And when my grave by all is no more remembered , With neither cross nor stone to mark its place , Let it be plowed by man , with spade let it be scatteredAnd my ashes ere to nothingness are restored , Let them turn to dust to cover your earthly space.Then it does n't matter that you should forget me : Your atmosphere , your skies , your vales I 'll sweep ; Vibrant and clear note to your ears I shall be : Aroma , light , hues , murmur , song , moanings deep , Constantly repeating the essence of the faith I keep.My idolized Country , for whom I most gravely pine , Dear Philippines , to my last goodbye , oh , harkenThere I leave all : my parents , loves of mine , I 'll go where there are no slaves , tyrants or hangmenWhere faith does not kill and where God alone does reign.Farewell , parents , brothers , beloved by me , Friends of my childhood , in the home distressed ; Give thanks that now I rest from the wearisome day ; Farewell , sweet stranger , my friend , who brightened my way ; Farewell , to all I love . To die is to rest .",0

"how do i find out what my citizenship is if i 'm an immigrant that was born in a refugee camp ? It depends on the immigration law of the country in which you were born . In the United States , citizenship is determined by two legal concepts , jus sangre and jus solis . The first is based on your parentage , the second on location . If you were born on US soil ( definitions of this can be complex , but it certainly includes all US States , Puerto Rico , etc ) , you acquired US citizenship at the time of birth under jus solis . you can check the source below for more information . If you are abroad , you can contact the local Embassy of Consulate of the nation you are interested in for information . Otherwise , you would normally refer to the local office of your country 's agency for handling citizenship , usually the Ministry of Internal Affairs , Home Ministry or Foreign Ministry.If you were born to at least one parent who was a US citizen at the time of your birth , you may be a US citzen under jus sangre . To determine this , check the source I list below . Your parent will have had to meet certain residency requirements and determination can only be made by factors such as your birthdate , which of parents is a citizen , and how long they may have resided in the US.Disclaimer : taking advice from a person using Bubba as a screen name could be hazardous for your health .

"what does high IgG and IgM values mean in immunoglobolin blood tests ? It could be an indicator of an auto-immune problem , or it could be nothing . The test itself having high levels really does n't tell anything by itself . You really need to discuss with your doctor if you have other symptoms , what they are , how severe they are , how frequent , what brings them on , and you would really benefit from keeping a journal of all that information , because sometimes there is so much you forget . Write down anything , sometimes things you think are no big deal can be relevant.If you had other tests taken , you should discuss those results as well . I have SLE ( lupus ) and I know from personal experience that it takes a lot of positive factors and time to determine a person even has an auto-immune problem . You are your own best advocate , so speak up for yourself .

"Best food for brain ? What can I eat to be more clever and remember more things ? Oh without question ... Try fish ... It makes a big difference ... you will fill it happen ... increased concentration and improved memory.This because fish contains Omega-3 fatty acids which is an 'essential fatty acid ' . An 'essential fatty acid ' is a type of fatty acid needed by our bodies which needs to be supplemented in our diets as we are incapable of producing it ourselves . Since most of us eat hugely insufficient amounts of such fatty acids , most of us are deficient in it . So adding it to our diets usually fulfils the immediate need for them and makes a big difference . Fatty fish are excellent sources of Omega-3 , but there is some concern about increased levels of heavy metal contaminants in their meat ... so i think it is best and more convenient to supplement your diet with processed fish oils ... which have been purified . Cod liver oil capsules are a popular and easily available fish oil supplement , however are very rich in Vitamin A . Perhaps the best choice left is to consider Fish Body Oil instead of fish liver oil ... if you can get your hands on those . Do consider it ... it 'll really help you out ... .. if you decide on taking cod liver oil ... take no more than one capsule every 3 or 4 days ... just to be on the safe side . Fish body oils can be safely taken every other day .",0

"How to put in color ink from an ink installation kit ? I have a Lexmark Z611 printer and I have an emty ink cartridge but I have this kit were I can put more ink into it but I do n't know exactly were to drill the holes to put in some more color ink . Can someone help me ? Your cartridge needs to have the top popped in order to refill . HOWEVER , make sure the cartridge has not been run empty , or it will not respond to refilling . Also if you have removed the cartridge and it is just sitting on your desk , then it will not respond either . The printhead needs to be kept damp , or protected . The last thing you need to know is that you MUST have lexmark 10n0026 ink . If you bought one of the universal kits , you may be stuck with ink that is too thin and will leak , or ink that is too thick and will clog.Once you determine that all is OK , simply use a knife to pry off the top of the cartridge , and if you can not tell which color goes where , use a tooth pick to determine which color is where . these are small cartridges and will not require much ink , so fill very slowly . Watch the printhead and the top of the cartridge at the same time . At the first sign of ink coming from the print head - STOP and pull back a bit on the needle ( a very little bit ) . You should also watch the top of the cartridge , as to avoid having the ink pour out of the top . Repeat for all colors . Hope this helps.If you have to remove the cartridge prior to refilling , then you should place it in a zipper bag along with a slightly damp paper towel , until you can get to it . It must remain moist , but not wet , and do not store in the freezer .",0

"Are you really offended by swearing ? Do you think profanity is stupid ? I do , I think it is the most superstitious bullshit ever . “ Oh noes , I have said a ‘ bad ’ word , someone is automatically offended ! ” Ridiculous . Anyway , what are your opinions on swearing ? Is it really that bad ? Does it really make people feel uncomfortable or is it just another word in the dictionary ? Is it limiting our rights to freedom of speech to not be able to swear on the radio or in settings like schools ? I personally dont get offended by them because they were always my second language . I do however think they can make a person sound extremely unintelligent when they use them simply for shock value . I think that as we mature though , it does seem to make you cringe when people curse with every other word out of their mouth . I can have a pretty dirty mouth when I get angry , or when I smash my thumb with a hammer or something- but in everyday conversation , whats the point ? Is it to sound `` cool ? '' I remember I used to do it for that reason when I was like 8 , but when the thrill wore off- it just seemed like those words really didnt have any real purpose for being in my sentances , but I didnt get offended by them- more like turned off I guess.If I meet someone and we are just having a conversation , and profanity takes up most of their conversation , I just think they are ignorant for the most part . I am used to it though , so sometimes the profanity seems more natural in certain situations.Taking Gods name in vain though , I think that is absolutely offensive because it is against the religious beliefs of many , whether you understand it or not- it does offend a lot of people.by the way , tranced- you didnt offend me either , you just gave me a bad impression of you . Your comments are ignorant because the truth is , if everyone believed in Jesus there wouldnt be any arguments , so the world wouldnt be so messed up . Like it or not its true , because if everyone believed in something moral - no matter what it is- we would all agree on that morality . So , to show you the ignorance in your statement- it is ridiculous to blame Christians for the worlds troubles when the worlds troubles are rooted in things that go AGAINST Christian belief ! Sometimes a little reason- goes a long way , no matter what your beliefs are .",0

"What do u think about current Nepal 's suitation ? At present , King has taken all the power and ruling of its own . Lot of protest goin on well , as of now , there are lots of activities that are going on , both overt and covert . on the surface , you have a king holding on to power by a slim thread , a thread called the Royal Nepalese Army . a thread that can break anytime because after all the soldiers too are humans and the way things are , a potential revolutionary situation is in the making ... .sdnt wonder if there are already cracks in the army . also we have the maoists who control nearly two-thirds of the country and only stopping short of storming the capital and taking power because of the big neighbour by the side , India , which has got its own maoist insurgency and India will not be too happy to see a communist country come up so close to borders . so that is a consideration . the political ( democratic ) party , i think have lost the people more or less , so the people dont have any place to go except the maoists or the royalists ... .whether the maoists are good or bad ( to put very simplistically ) is irrelevant , what is relevant is that the king is on his last legs ( the fact that people are coming out against him openly in a place where kings were once revered as incarnation of God , is proof enough of his complete loss of authority ) and may come crashing down soon ... .as to what will happen after that , depends on the tussle of will between maoists , the neutral people inside nepal and India and China to an extent.very interesting days ahead i am sure ! ! !",0

"Would Americans like for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state ? Puerto Rico has been a colony for more than 100 years of the US and once again the isue has come up to decide for its political future , independence or statehood . I 'm sure Americans do n't want Puerto Rico to become a state . With a population larger than that of many other states , PR would be more powerful in Congress than those less populated states.As to FL Boy 's answer , I 'd say that although it would never become a major player , as an independent nation , PR definitely would n't be worthless in the world 's economy . it happens that PR is the world 's largest producer of prescription medicines and pacemakers.My comment on One 's answer is that thousands of Puerto Ricans serve and have served in all of the military branches of the U.S . They have also fought and died in the wars fought by the US , including Iraq and Desert Storm . During the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) , the 65th Infantry Division , made up entirely of Puerto Ricans , kicked some seroius North Korean behinds . So as you can see , the Island 's protection from the US Military HAS had a very high cost to Puerto Ricans.And please , do n't get me wrong . I am totally against freeloaders on welfare , be them white Americans , African Americans or even Puerto Ricans .",0

"Can diffusion take place in solids ? Yes.Orthoclase feldspar is an example . At high temperatures , Fe will fit into the orthoclase lattice . As temperature drops , the lattice shrinks so that Fe no longer fits . Fe diffuses out of the latice and accumulates along the planes between orthoclase crystal twins . Along the way , it grabs O to produce Fe2O3 . If you look closely at pink granite , usually you will see that the pink grains are actually white and red striped . Those grains are orthoclase crystals with exsolved hematite along twin planes.Exsolution and diffusion of Fe from orthoclase can only occur at high temperature . If the orthoclase cools too quickly for the Fe to diffuse out , it will remain in the orthoclase lattice , which will be distorted to accomodate the larger ( larger than K ) Fe ion.Material science is not boring .",0

"Why is there such a limited choice of realistic US pres . Candidates & how to fix that ? or can we ? The vote is wasted on 3rd party candidates and the rest are slim to say the least . I heard more people complain about the choices this past election than every . Our political system actually filters out decent , ethical and talented candidates .

"Why do white men like asian chicks so much ? This is probably not the first time you come across this phenomenon . These days , you see a great number of white men wanting to be with asian chicks other than gals of other races . What qualities about asian chicks that white men like about ? Why do asian chicks want to be with white men ? An input from both male and female would be good ! Men believe ( rightly or wrongly ) that an Asian girl will be more submissive or docile . They stereotype Asian women in that way based upon what they see in movies or based upon what they hear goes on in Asia . Some Asian women are attracted to white men because they want someone who does n't treat them as subserviant . They want to be treated as an equal . See what can go wrong in this picture ? Obviously many relationships between Asians and westerners work just fine , but if someone is just trying to attract `` any Asian '' or `` any white guy '' , there could be a problem . As far as physical attraction , perhaps some are attracted by the more youthful appearance , but some may also be attracted by the fact that in general , Asians tend to be slimmer than western women . Many guys find that attractive . Guys look at a woman 's mother for a clue at what his girl may look like in the future . Asian parents tend to be slimmer than western parents . There is some male input for you .",0

I know their are surgeries out there to fix it , and some say exercise helps . The nose strips and sprays do not work because it is coming from his throat , not his nose . He believes he has sleep apnea , but we do not have the money to test for this . Anyone else experience this and can reccomend a solution thayt worked for them ? Your boyfriend needs to seriously consider testing for sleep apnea , especially if the snoring seems to be throat-based . I 'll just bet he has it , too . Age is not a factor ; I am told kids as young as 12 can have it.I have it and did n't know it . For me , it was n't a snoring issue ; it was an issue with not getting a restful night 's sleep . I 'd wake up in the morning and feel completely exhausted.I was tested three years ago and was shocked to find out that I stopped breathing 30 times in three hours , which essentially woke me up . When the clinic stirred me , they put me on a CPAP ( controlled positive air pressure machine ) and I fell into deep REM sleep for the first time in I ca n't remember . Since then , I use the CPAP every night and sleep like a baby . You will , too.I ca n't stress enough the health implications of this beyond the lack of sleep . It is a severe drag on the heart and respiratory system.I ca n't speak to your financial issues , but medical insurance should cover this if your doctor makes the referral.According to my doctor , surgery has only a 35 % success rate .

"When is the best time to go to disney world ? This is my response to a similar question : This depends on what you are looking for as far as the best time . Christmas time is one of the most beautiful times of the year . Each resort is decorated for Christmas and the decorations are beautiful . If you go during this time you have to visit the resorts . They have a carousel made out of chocolate , a a very large gingerbread house and other amazing things . Plus , the christmas trees are beautiful as well . Also , the whether is nicer . Usually it will run in the low 70s during the day . If you are near the water it is a little cold and windy , but not too bad . Also , the parades in the park are themed for Christmas and very nice to see . However , if you have never been to Disney , you may want to see the regular parades . The crowds can be bad , but I have gone several times during Christmas and it is a great time of the year to go . I highly recommend staying away from the time around July 4 . During this time almost all of the parks will close due to capacity . So lines are extremely long and it is terrible to try to get around . Also , it is very hard . Combine the large crowds and the heat and it can be misserable . You will not have as much fun if it is this hot and crowded as you would otherwise . however , the fireworks during this time are spectacular and will not dissapoint . But you have to wait a long time in order to see them from a good location.I usually prefer going after school has started . September/October is a great time . The weather is nice , crowds are n't and big as the other times of the year . If you go in value season you can save yourself some money . Keep in mind , Disney will often do refurbishments during this time because it is not as busy , so some attractions may be closed while you are there . But it easy to find this out ahead of time . Also , if you go in October you can go to Mickey 's not so scary halloween . This is a must see if you go during this time . The park is closed early that day and you have to have another ticket to get in . But there is a fraction of the people in the park . There are rides open and you basically walk right on . It is nice to be there when it is n't as busy and it is really neat as well . Plus , if you have kids , it is more kid friendly than the Universal Halloween party.So you need to think about what you prefer and then take your vacation at that time of year .",0
"which is a good album to start on the beatles ? i 've loved all of the beatles songs i 've heard so far and want to buy an album , but there 's so many and they 're all good ! which do i start with ? If you are a true beginner , the album `` One '' has all their Number One hits , and covers their career throughout . It serves as a good survey.If you think you will eventually get all their albums maybe you do n't want a greatest hits album like `` One . '' In that case I 'd think about what period Beatles you like the best and pick one of the following : `` Meet The Beatles '' ( very early ) ; `` Rubber Soul '' ( middle peroid , where things start to get more complicated ; `` Abbey Road '' ( late Beatles -- mix of stuff . ) In some ways Sgt . Pepper is considered their best , but much of that is beacuse of its historical significance , its psychedelia , and its sort-of theme album status -- all of which I think are less important today than at the time . To me , it has fewer great songs and is a bit harder to get into . But you ca n't go wrong with any choice .",0

"why is the child support system not more fair to the fathers who are in their child ` s life ? What cheermom stated demonstrates that there are similarities between California and Iowa . The point to keep in mind is that the Child Support Systems are usually divided into multiple sections . For those who work with individuals involved in the various cases , those who look out for the interests of the children , those are involved in the getting payments form the State to the primary care giver of the child , and those who collect money owed by a parent of record who is mandated by the court to make payments . These departments must follow the orders of the court . That is , a parent who is working to be involved in the life of the child is a great thing , but if they are not paying their court ordered child support payments , these departments have no choice but to act for the court and collect the funds from the delinquent parent . If a parent disagrees with the amount owed ( for whatever reason ) , their argument is not with the State departments but with the court and they must go back to the court to have a new order issued.Here in Iowa they will go after the delinquent parent irregardless of their job position and this includes working with other States . Only the court can change this reality.I realize that it can be frustrating , but the parents are best served if they do not try to mix things such as visitations and child support payments , the courts view them as two different actions .",0

"Is illiteracy , unemployment and over population in the Muslim nations , the main reason for terrorism ? No . The reason terrorism targets America is because they feel like we interfer with their internal politics when we put troops in Saudia Arabia in 1990 and fought Iraq in Gulf War 1 . Shortly thereafter is when you see all these attack start against America.The reason why America does this stuff wether you agree or disagree is oil . People told Bush 1 you have to go out there and say you are doing this for the people of Kuwait but the real reson was oil and we ca n't tell the American people that.Remember no blood for oil ? I never believed it , until the last few months when I saw on History Channel people who advised Bush 1 saying thats what happened.They are n't that bad over there . They just hate us cause we get in the way of their making profit with oil . So the rich people hire the terrorist bosses to do these things.And vwahala , oil is more expensive.So from that perspective if we wanted to save money on oil , WE SHOULD HAVE STAYED OUT OF THIS MESS IN THE FIRST PLACE .",0

"'NASTERDAM ' who is this man ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Born in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in the south of France in December 1503 , Michel de Nostredame was the son of a grain dealer who was also a prosperous home-grown notary . His family was originally Jewish , but had converted to Catholicism during the previous century along with thousands of others , due to increasing official French persecution of Jews , many of whom were the descendants of former refugees from Spain , where they were known as the Marranos . The names of Nostredame 's known forebears seem to reflect this . While practice of the ancestral religion was often apparently continued in secret , nobody knows whether this applied to Nostredame 's family , or whether it still applied to him two generations later . ( It should be noted that the majority of Jews at the time frowned upon such 'cover conversions ' , not least because succeeding generations of offspring were inevitably more at risk to lose connection with their past , and thus with their roots and religion . ) His adult religious leanings suggest , however , that his upbringing was devoutly Catholic.This apart , nothing is known about his childhood , but at the age of fifteen he entered the University of Avignon to study for his baccalaureate . After little more than a year he was forced by the plague to leave again . In 1529 , after some years as an apothecary , he entered the University of Montpellier to study for a doctorate in medicine , but was promptly expelled again when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary , which was a 'manual ' trade expressly banned by the university statutes . He then continued work as an apothecary ( though some of his publishers and correspondents would later call him 'Doctor ' ) , and created a `` rose pill '' that was widely believed to protect against the the plague.In 1531 he was invited by Jules-César Scaliger , a leading Renaissance man , to come to Agen . There Nostradamus married a woman whose name is still in dispute ( possibly Henriette d'Encausse ) , but who bore him two children . In 1534 , however , his wife and children died , presumably from the plague . After their death he continued to travel , passing through France and possibly Italy.He settled down in 1547 in Salon-de-Provence , where he married a rich widow named Anne Ponsarde Gemelle and eventually had six children – three daughters and three sons . After a further visit to Italy , he began to move away from medicine and towards the occult . He wrote an almanac for 1550 , for the first time Latinising his name to 'Nostradamus ' , and was so encouraged by its success that he decided to write one or more annually . Taken together , they are known to have contained at least 6338 prophecies ( most of them , in the event , failed predictions – see Chevignard and Lemesurier ( 2 ) under Sources ) , as well as at least 11 annual calendars , all of them starting on 1st January and not , as is sometimes supposed , in March . He then began his project of writing 1,000 quatrains , which form the supposed prophecies for which he is famous today . Feeling vulnerable to religious fanatics , however , he devised a method of obscuring his meaning by using `` Virgilianised '' syntax , word games and a mixture of languages such as Provençal , Greek , Latin and Italian . For technical reasons connected with their publication in three instalments , the last 58 quatrains of the seventh 'Century ' , or book of 100 verses , did not survive into any extant edition.The quatrains , written in a book titled `` Les Propheties '' , received a mixed reaction when they were published . Some people thought Nostradamus was a servant of evil , a fake , or insane , while many of the elite thought his quatrains were spiritually inspired prophecies . Soon nobility were coming from far and wide to receive horoscopes and advice from him , though he normally expected them to supply the birthcharts on which they were based .

"Why do i do bad things when i know theyre bad , but i cant stop ? Why do i tell myself ill stop smokin , or poppin pills , or dealin or any of that , but i always end up doin it again ? Things like that sometimes seem easy to do , and get away with , but the repercussions can be burdensome . Also , they tend to glue you into a mindset and a lifestyle that may not be the best for your future . Putting yourself into active things , oftentimes using your body instead of your mind , is a good way to lose those feelings that can creep up on you and tempt you . A job , a hobby , a group , frienships , family time , are all good avenues . Sometimes leaving a situation you are in is a viable alternative , with friends , groups , etc . Life is not perfect , so finding a way to not feel totally out of whack when they happen can keep you level-headed . Forgiveness also keeps you from feeling like your carrying the load around with you . Also , the take some of that edge that we all fell like we are the most important thing around , and putting more selflessness , doing things for others even when you might not feel like it , can adjust your attitude toward feeling less alone . Guard your mind , what you put in it , or what you allow others to put in it , because this will affect how you think , and what you think about . Positive action is often the best thing for emotions that want to burst . How you act affects how you think , and vice-versa . In time , they become more a part of what you are and , hopefully , what you want to ideally become . Keep a your head up . Best to you !",0

This is a straight forward situation where you really need to walk away . But based on the background in your question , I sense that you may have a little trouble understanding why . So I will offer a little bit more.Consider that you may be only hearing what you want to hear . The fact that he said that he 'cared for you ' and that 'it was n't working ' . Sound contradictory when taken as sentence fragments , but in reality they are part of a much bigger communication context . I suspect that if you did n't just listen for what you want to hear , the message would sound alot more clear cut.Also when he says that he is ready to try again and start over , that may just be driven by some alterior motive ( sex ) . Men will say/do almost anything for that , and given that he is much older it is very conceivable that he is well versed in maniuplating younger more impressionable and vulnerable women.Do n't be a victim of these games .

Few of these programs remain in the US and the proportion of nurses practicing with a diploma is rapidly decreasing.Graduation from a university with a bachelor 's degree in nursing ( a four - five year program conferring the BSN/BN degree with enhanced emphasis on leadership and research as well as clinically-focused courses ) .As far as courses : Anatomy and physiologyMicrobiologyPharmacology and medication administrationPsychologyNursing ethicsNursing theoryNursing practiceLegal issues in nursing practice,0
"do you believe in god ? I know there is a God . I did n't arrive at this conclusion by my intellect , for human intelligence is limited . Give up on trying to figure everything out , for common sense itself should tell you that you ca n't know or understand everything . This is not a matter of the head , but of the heart . Ask yourself this : `` If God is the truth , do I really want to know the truth ? '' Our sinfulness makes us afraid of a holy and righteous God who we feel must demand an accounting of us His creatures . Atheists say they do n't believe in God , but I do n't believe in atheists . If they do n't believe in God , then who are they so mad at ? They claim wisdom and knowledge and call believers simple , but I see atheists as being extremely smallminded and limited . Did atoms and microbes not exist until some human came along who was smart enough to detect them ? How small these people 's reality must be ! How futile and pointless their existence ! I commend you for at least being openminded enough to ask ? How foolish it is to think that one 's ignorance is evidence ! Thanks for not being that way , wisdom is not beyond the grasp of one such as yourself . There is a God ; He is beyond human comprehension ; He is absolutely holy , righteous , and frightfuly just . His awesome majesty and power is terrifying and he is completely unapproachable by vile , prideful humans . Remember I said that it is our innate sense of this reality that drives some to deny His existense out of fear of the truth . They ca n't face themselves and their guilt , and they ca n't face a righteously angry , holy , and just God whom they rightly think will demand retribution of them . What they do n't understand is that this same God is also infinitely loving , kind , gracious and merciful , and that He paid the penalty for their sins and removed their guilt which was keeping them from Him . How ? He gave us His only begotten Son Jesus Christ who took our sins and guilt upon his holy and innocent self and was put to death so that we may go free . Believe this , make claim to it as a FREE GIFT from God , confess it to Him and to others , then walk in peace from now on with Him , always trusting Jesus ' sacrifice as your justification in God 's eyes , not your own merit . Then keep on learning more of Him and growing spiritually. > < > Sir Brian",0

The rationale being that he had served his sentence.. executed and pronounced dead.He could n't therefore be sentenced again for no man could be punished twice for the same offence and I believe its what we call 'double jeopardy'.Therefore , if you die and live after being executed ... you are a free man ... but is there such a chance ? : )",0

"What type of rocks are usually taken from quarries ? Any type of rock or mineral ore can be quarried if the deposit is close enough to the surface of the earth . Most quarry operations are for limestone and dolomite in the US . The primary product of quarries is what is called 'natural aggregates ' which most people just call gravel . Of the natural aggregates produced in the US , 71 % are limestone and dolomite , 15 % are granite , and 8 % is from gabbro , basalt and diabase . The remaining 6 % is sandstone , quartzite , marble , slate , shell , and volcanic cinder and scoria . These statistics are from the USGS . Coal strip mines and iron and copper open pit mines are generally not called quarries , but are very much the same in that they dig into the earth in open holes to recover minerals .

Large music lables dish out millions and millions to promote artists albums , and in return , get air time , national tours in large venues , and thier latest single played on Mtv ( the same corporation that tells you what to think , what to say , and what to listen to ) . It is because people are being force-fed this mainstream bullshit pop music , that people have infatuations with a particular group for an extended period of time . Also , to make more money for the record executives , bands sometimes release up to five singles off of just one album . This creates the illusion that the CD is doing well , and continues to place the band in the spotlight , in return , making more money . Bands with little or no talent ( Maroon 5 ) can ride an album for over 2 years without producing any new material .",0

That is why you are more likely to have headaches . Some headaches are n't physical but rather psycho - somatic . It has been found in psychology , that if you feel stressed about something , or you feel guily about an emotion you should n't experience , it might easier be translated into physical terms , such as headaches , neckaches , etc.Plus , if want to know about sex , I assume you have n't experienced it much before . That is a kind of imbalance that may affect people differently.The key to solving both your study problems , and your sex curiosity appears to be simple , relaxation . One question you should ask yourself , how often do you let yourself go , relax . Some people find it to be the greatest aspect of sexual satisfaction , a kind of relief , feellings of floatiness , etc . Maybe unconsciously your body knows what you want , more even than you do , and prods you in that direction , of completely giving in to relaxation.But that is just an opinion , your medical health provider might know more.Hope that helps .",0

"What will I have to pay in taxes on an annuity when I withdraw money at age 62 ? Annuities are investments . The portion of your withdrawal that represents your initial investment is withdrawn tax-free . All the earnings on your investment are taxed as ordinary income . This is summarized in IRS Tax Topic 410 ( first link below ) , and more fully detailed in IRS Publication 575 ( second link below ) .There 's no such thing as one-third is tax free , as another answer suggested.To give an over-simplified example : let 's say you invested $ 100,000 into an annuity . And now the annuity is worth $ 500,000 . The original $ 100,000 is returned to you tax-free , and the remaining $ 400,000 is taxable income . Annuities are designed to provide you income for life , and so you will be spreading your tax-free withdrawals over the entire period of your withdrawals.Spending an hour or so with a CPA should help you plan your retirement so that you minimize your taxes.All the best , William Pereztaxes.about.com",0

"What exactly is a black hole ? A blackhole is a collection of matter with gravity so immense that nothing can escape how strong the pull of it is unless when you are in it 's pull you can accelerate faster than the speed of light and beyond , thus the blackhole swallows up light as well.What happens is large masses collapse under their own weight . Think of a house of cards . The more you pile on , the greater the weight becomes until the cards on the bottom ca n't take the weight anymore . When the house of cards falls , the cards still exist but have lost their structure do to gravity.Now instead of a house of cards , replace that with an enormous sun that has tons of matter inside . The sun is teetering on the brink of collapsing as the matter inside grows and grows until eventually , like the house of cards , it falls down . Except since this is a sphere in space is is being pulled inward by it 's onw gravity , and not down like earth gravity , the sun does n't fall down , it falls IN.When this does happen the gravity does n't stop existing because the matter does n't either , it becomes smaller and the gravity grows as it pulls larger and larger amounts of matter into it 's core . Eventually it because so dense and so massive and so small that the gravity involved will not allow even Photons , or light particles , the fastest thing in the universe to pass through it.There ya have it !",0

"someone tell me inlaymans terms , why it is impossible for physical objects to travel at the speed of light ? Here are two explanations ( neither particularly satisfying I will tell you in advance . ) The first is that the speed of light ( in a vaccuum ) is a property of the universe that is measured the same by everyone , regardless of their motion relative to anyone else . This is a true statement born out by experiment , but it implies some very weird stuff . One is that distance and time are not measured the same by people in relative motion . Another is that you can never get closer to a beam of light going away from you ( i.e . go faster than the speed of light ) . If you could , you would measure the speed of light differently than someone else , and you would be special . The basic idea behind relativity is that , with regard to the laws of physics , no one is special . The second unsatisfying answer is E=mc^2 . In order to go faster , you have to accelerate . Acceleration takes energy , and an accelerating body has more mass than a body in a constant state of motion ( increase E in that equation m has go up , because c is the constant speed of light ) . It just so happens that the mass does n't go up in proportion to the rate of acceleration , but in relationship to how close you are to the speed of light . Everytime you halve the distance between your speed and the speed of light , your mass doubles , and the amount of effort needed to get that next bit of acceleration doubles .

"Do you believe its right that we are helping Iraq when they bombed us , but we will not even try to help mexico I am just wondering because my StepFather is Hispanic and he has took me to Mexico , the United states tells hispanics to get a green card if they want to come hear , but how when they ca n't even make enough to buy food ? Granted there has been many incidents with hispanics they are just trying to feed there family like many of us . You 're assuming that we are actually helping Iraq . I do n't think we 're helping Iraq . I do n't think we should be `` helping '' Iraq . In fact , the U.S. has a very poor track record `` helping '' other countries . More often than not , the other countries end up worse off than before.Allowing unlimited Mexicans to enter the U.S. is not going to help Mexico or Mexicans . It will simply depress the already depressed economy in the border areas , and in metropolitan areas farther north.Nor will having the U.S. just throw money at Mexico help for more than a very short time . It may feed people for a short time , but it wo n't improve the economy . Mexico is poor because it is poor in natural resources , especially in arable land . The only way to improve the economy is to either improve the natural resources available or find ways of providing valuable goods services to entities outside of Mexico so that money is flowing into the country .",0

"What is the real % of possibilities of getting aids from oral sex in case there are no obvious wounds ? The risk of becoming infected with HIV through unprotected ( without a condom ) oral sex is lower than that of unprotected anal or vaginal sex . However , a lower-risk activity will increase in risk when it is done often enough . The Options Project found that 7.8 % ( 8 of 102 ) of recently infected men who have sex with men in San Francisco were probably infected through oral sex . Nearly half ( 3 of 8 ) of these cases reported oral problems , including occasional bleeding gums . Almost all ( 7 of 8 ) of these men reported to have had oral contact with pre-semen or semen.The risk of oral sex transmission ( 8 % ) in this study is higher than many researchers had previously thought or found in other studies . More media attention appeared to be placed on this particular study , probably because of the higher number of study participants . There appears to be evidence that higher-risk activities ( anal sex ) among men who have sex with men is decreasing while lower-risk activities ( oral sex ) among these men is increasing . Oral sex has always been considered a lower-risk activity but is certainly not risk free .",0

"Why do some states still have barbaric ways and have the death penilty and others do n't ? I notice that there is still legallized murder in some states and none in others . How can a civillized government allow this to happen in any states ? The short answer is that we live in a Democracy and death penalty laws are on the books because people ( or their representatives ) put them there . There are usually four distinct groups of people involved and it cuts across party lines . Large groups favor the death penalty and large groups oppose it for any number of good reasons . Small groups who have lost someone to murder believe that the death penalty is `` too good '' for the perpetrator , but are not allowed to take the law into their own hands . Small groups related to the murderer oppose the death penalty because of shame and the fact that they still love the perpetrator and find good excuses for him/her.On top of all that , sensational murders committed by those who expect to escape punishment spur on society to support the death penalty . Crimes against innocent children are particularly heinous . And news that someone convicted of murder has been proven ( by DNA tests ? ) to be innocent show the weaknesses in our judicial system.The question really is not all that simple . In New York state , the results of a close Governors race was likely determined on the death penalty issue . The winner favored the penalty while the incumbent never used it based on personal beliefs . Changing politics will always be involved . Many will always feel that a barbaric murderer should know that he/she might face a barbaric fate . And some feel that might save innocent lives .",0

"Why does society feel that they have the right to impose their opinion on others ?

Why do people feel they have the right to force others to live the way they 've chosen instead of leaving these issues up to the person who will be affected by their choice . Abortion and religious decisions should absolutely be made only by yourself only . You are absolutely right how people try to impose their beliefs onto others .

"Should I get a Master 's in Special Education or Public Policy ? I enjoy both fields . I currently have a bachelor 's in Finance , a field I 'm not too interested in.In the past I had a two year internship with my State Senator and a 1 year job as a special ed instructional assistant . I enjoyed both positions.Paying for it is not too much of a problem either as the state offers loan reimbursements for special ed teachers and the school of public policy is offering generous scholarships.So perhaps it comes down to job availability . There is definately a big need for special ed teachers . I do n't know how easy it is to get a legislative job however , although if it is possible I may really enjoy it.What do you think ? While public policy is an undoubedly exciting field , the rewards you 'll get and receive in special education are certainly among the most satisfying available.You have an opportunity to positively affect countless children and adults with challenges far beyond the average person .

It is unfortunate that you 're still making judgements and assumptions using such gross generalizations , but I ca n't blame you , per se , as it does appear that the use of that word is tolerated by blacks when you hear rap music or watch certain movies .",0

Not so fond of Washington politics , he resigned from the Senate in 1842 and returned to New Hampshire to practice law . He turned down political offers to serve in the Mexican War , and was eventually made a Brigadier General . In 1852 he attended the Democratic national convention and , much to his surprise , won the nomination and the election . He tried unsuccessfully to promote conciliation between the North and the South and served only one term , losing in 1856 to James Buchanan .",0

Thanks in advance . this is difficult to do without drawing . but here 's the gist of it.1 . < a + < b + < c + < d = 360 ( definition of quadrilateral ) 2 . < a + < b + < a + < b = 360 ( since a = c and b = d ) 3 . 2 ( a + b ) = 3604. a + b = 1805 . < a and < b are supplementary anglesnow extend the line AB and include a new point X , so you have a picture that looks like : XA DB C < XAD and < BAD are supplementary since XAB is a lineabove we proved that < ABC and < BAD are also supplementaryso < XAD + < BAD = 180and < ABC + < BAD = 180which means < XAD = < ABCso now we can conclude that AD || BCbecause the corresponding angles < XAD and < ABC are congruent.you can use this same logic to show that AB || DChope this makes sense..",0

It is a period of 40 days when Catholics remember the 40 days Jesus fasted in the desert and his ultimate sacrifice at the end of Lent , Good Friday . Marti Gras ( french for Fat Tuesday ) has traditionally become the time for celebration as a last big fling before Lent arrives and people try to restrict themselves more . Also , during Lent , Catholics are supposed to avoid meat other than fish on fridays . On Ash Wednesday , Catholics go to a church service during which the entire congregation processes up to have the priest place ashes on their forehead as a reminder that `` of dust we were made and to dust we shall return '' and our own mortalities .",0

"Why are so many blacks calling each other the N-word when they hate it so much ? Seems like a double standard. ? Even the mayor of New Orleans called it a `` chocolate '' city . From my perspective , it has nothing to do with any one person or group finding a term `` offensive . '' It has everything to do with wanting POWER.One form or POWER is the `` double standard , '' in which one group of people can engage in some activity or speech which another group can not . There have been double standards since the dawn of time , and to this day , you will hear women complain about the double-standards about men 's sexual behavior and their general assertiveness as compared to that of women . A newer incarnation of the double standard is political correctness , in which one group of people attempt to control and limit the words or thoughts of another.When one group can effectively limit the ability of of another to do the same , the first group `` feels '' a sense of control or power . I say `` feels '' because any such quest for power , based in the desire to forbid another person from saying a particular 6-letter word is a misguided and inconsequential exertion of power . it really changes nothing ( at least in the short term ) . About the only thing it accomplishes is inflicting a sense of guilt on the intended target . If you 're motivated by guilt , it has worked . In the scheme of things , it 's minor . You can choose to fight it if you want , but to do so involves incurring the wrath of a politcally-correct society , who has accepted , for whatever reason , the argument from the messenger that this restriction should be enforced , not legally , but socially , via scorn , derision and ostracization . That may mean losing friends , losing your job , or quite possibly losing points on Yahoo Answers ( or even your entire account ) .So that 's the way I see it . And If the people who are trying to control the speech , be they black or female , or whatever , really look at it objectively , they ca n't help but admit that there 's a grasp for a modicum of power involved .",0
"What is lake-effect snow ? Lake effect snow is also know as a snowsquall . It is produced in the winter when cold winds move across long expanses of warmer lake water , picking up water vapor which freezes and is deposited on the lee shores . This effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic effect of higher elevations on the downwind shores . This uplifting can produce narrow , but very intense bands of precipitation , which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow per hour . The areas affected by lake effect snow are called snowbelts.Cold winds in the winter typically prevail from the west-southwest to the northwest in the North Temperate Zone , producing the most dramatic lake effect snow falls on the northeast to south east shores of the Great Lakes . This lake effect produces a significant difference between the snow fall on the eastern and western shores of the Great Lakes . If the air temperature is not low enough to keep the precipitation frozen , it falls as lake effect rain.To can read a detailed article on Lake Snow Effect , Variables Contributing to Lake Effect Snow and Areas Hit By Lake Effect Snow and much more at the following articles : ( 1 ) http : //www.noaa.gov/questions/question_011602.html ( 2 ) http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_effect_snow ( 3 ) http : //www.usatoday.com/weather/tg/wlakeeff/wlakeeff.htm ( 4 ) http : //www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/ ( 5 ) http : //www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap10/lake_effect_snow.html",0

"what does the internal atomic structure of a mineral most likely determines ? color , age , streak , origin ... I am not going to pick any of those choices because I do n't believe any of those are correct , including streak . What you are describing is crystal structure , which might be related to color and streak , but since trace impurities in a mineral often determine color , and streak is nothing more than the color of a powdered form of the mineral I do n't think It will be determined by atomic structure with certainty . Most streaks are white ! Cleavage would be a correct answer but it was not included above . Cleavage and crystal structure are closely related properties . What you have described is the crystal structure . All minerals can be classified within 14 basic crystal lattice arrangements of the atoms in three dimensions . These 14 lattice arrangements fit within 7 larger crystal systems , allowing the classification of atomic structure of all known minerals .

"who is the president of armenia ? Robert Kocharian ( Armenian : Ռոբերտ Քոչարյան ) ( born August 31 , 1954 ) is the second president of the third republic of Armenia.Kocharian was born in Stepanakert , Nagorno-Karabakh , at that time a region of the Azerbaijan SSR . After becoming president of Nagorno-Karabakh in 1994 , he became Prime Minister of Armenia in 1997 . In April 1998 , he replaced Levon Ter-Petrossian as President of Armenia.He was a Communist Party official during the Soviet era but is no longer a member of any political party . Under Kocharian , Armenia has experienced stability and growth and the emigration rampant under Ter-Petrossian has been reduced . He has also taken a realistic stance in the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.His re-election during 2003 was marred by allegations of electoral fraud against both candidates , though most experts contend that any irregularities were not enough to sway the outcome . There were sporadic calls for Kocharian 's resignation in early 2004 with opposition-led demonstrators taking to the streets in support of demands for a referendum of confidence in him.Kocharian and his wife , Bella Kocharian , have three children .",0

'' [ 1 ] ) . These immigrants brought with them a very distinct style of English speaking , which was then combined with the African languages spoken by the African Americans who were at this time enslaved in the South . Over time this cultural and linguistic diversity combined with the South 's rural isolation , and longtime use and familiarity with the King James Version of the Bible in religious life , to produce a unique American dialect .",0

"What are the different types of volcano ? How do they differ ? Please provide an example / location . Geologists classify volcanoes in following ways : Cinder cones are the simplest type of volcano . They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent . As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air , it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent to form a circular or oval cone . Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit and rarely rise more than a thousand feet or so above their surroundings . Cinder cones are numerous in western North America as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of the world.Some of the Earth 's grandest mountains are composite volcanoes -- sometimes called stratovolcanoes . They are typically steep-sided , symmetrical cones of large dimension built of alternating layers of lava flows , volcanic ash , cinders , blocks , and bombs and may rise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases . Some of the most conspicuous and beautiful mountains in the world are composite volcanoes , including Mount Fuji in Japan , Mount Cotopaxi in Ecuador , Mount Shasta in California , Mount Hood in Oregon , and Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier in Washington.Shield volcanoes , the third type of volcano , are built almost entirely of fluid lava flows . Flow after flow pours out in all directions from a central summit vent , or group of vents , building a broad , gently sloping cone of flat , domical shape , with a profile much like that of a warrior 's shield . They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of highly fluid lava flows called basalt lava that spread widely over great distances , and then cool as thin , gently dipping sheets . Lavas also commonly erupt from vents along fractures ( rift zones ) that develop on the flanks of the cone . Some of the largest volcanoes in the world are shield volcanoes . In northern California and Oregon , many shield volcanoes have diameters of 3 or 4 miles and heights of 1,500 to 2,000 feet . The Hawaiian Islands are composed of linear chains of these volcanoes including Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the island of Hawaii -- two of the world 's most active volcanoes.Volcanic or lava domes are formed by relatively small , bulbous masses of lava too viscous to flow any great distance ; consequently , on extrusion , the lava piles over and around its vent . A dome grows largely by expansion from within . As it grows its outer surface cools and hardens , then shatters , spilling loose fragments down its sides . Some domes form craggy knobs or spines over the volcanic vent , whereas others form short , steep-sided lava flows known as `` coulees . '' Volcanic domes commonly occur within the craters or on the flanks of large composite volcanoes . The nearly circular Novarupta Dome that formed during the 1912 eruption of Katmai Volcano , Alaska , measures 800 feet across and 200 feet high .",0

how can you prove that 1+1 is 2 ? prove your answer ? does 1+1=2 is actually a really good question because there is really no way of proving it . Because numbers are abstract ( they are not real ) they represent other things . But if you look at the equation 1+1=2 you will actually see that by itself it makes no sense because one plus one does not equal a two symbol . so without subsituiting the number symbols for actual things the equation is irrational and can not be proven .,0

"Will cognitive science change the way we think as much as other sciences have ? Yes , very much in the following years . Cognitive science has much to its credit already . Among other accomplishments , it has given rise to models of human cognitive bias and risk perception , and has been influential in the development of behavioral finance , part of economics . It has also given rise to a new theory of the philosophy of mathematics , and many theories of artificial intelligence , persuasion and coercion . It has made its presence firmly known in philosophy of language and epistemology - a modern revival of rationalism - as well as constituting a substantial wing of modern linguistics .",0
"Is Oil is much too important a commodity to be left in the hands of the Arabs ? `` Oil is much too important a commodity to be left in the hands of the Arabs. -- - Henry Kissinger , US Secretary of State under Presidents Nixon & Ford Society and the economy demand a steady supply of oil . I know on no one who has pulled the main circuit breaker of their home or thrown away the keys to their car ( s ) , especially gas guzzlers whether they are liberal or conservative . It is our problem . Whoever owns the oil should profit by its sale , but oil need not become a geopolitical football.The real question is whether oil will be used to fuel the world or to fuel terrorism . The fuel problem is only temporary . We need to capture perhaps 1 % of 1 % of the sun 's solar energy to meet all our needs . Technology is rapidly improving . Soon there will be available relatively cheap plastic foil photovoltaic cells to convert solar energy to electrical energy . The technology already exists . The roofs of most buildings will be covered with them . Then we will still need a little oil to lubricate our bikes and hedge clippers . The problem is to obtain and maintain world peace until then . And that may be a decade or two .",0

"Does water evaporate faster in a warm room or a cool room ? 5th grade science project . We put equal aomounts of water in three plastic cups . One cup was put by a heat vent , another cup was put in the basement near a door and the third cup was put in the living room.The cups in the basement and the living room are evaporating at the same rate . The cup near the vent is evaporating faster . Why are the cups in the the basement and living evaporating and the same rate ? Why is the cup near the vent evaporating faster ? It 's to do with humidity of the air . If you watch the weather report you may notice that humidity is expressed as a percentage . This is how 'full ' the air is with water vapour . If the air is nearly empty ( low humidity ) then water will evaporate more quickly . If the air is full ( high humidity ) the water will evaporate more slowly ( it may even receive more water from the air ! ) .Here is the key : hot air can hold MORE water than cold air . So even if say a gallon of water is the most that some amount of air can hold , if you the air up the air will no longer be 'full ' ( for example it might be only 70 % full , hence 70 % humidity ) .This is not a complete answer as I do not know everything about it . It 's pretty advanced for 5th grade ( I learnt about it in the 11th grade ! ) . For more information look up EQUILIBRIUM in chemistry .",0

"is carbohydrates good for building muscles ? well my friend IMHO I can answer you that pretty well . Carbs are the fuel for your muscle when you work out . The best carbs during the day are complex carbs like sweet potato and oatmeals , and veggies . When you are about to workout , during workout and right after finishing your training are simple carbs with fast digesting protein . Best bet is a combination ( 50:50 of glucose and dextrose ) and whey protein .

"Is salvation for the jews only ? According to Judaism , all the righteous in the world , Jewish or not , have their portion in the world to come.First and foremost , Jews believe strongly in the concept of Chasedei Umos Haolam ( lit . Righteous People of the Nations of the World ) that they are abundantly and lavishly rewarded for their good deeds . So , according to the jewish view , salvation is truly for every good-doer or do-gooder in the world , regardless of faith or heritage.However , for a more in depth discussion , this question is quite tricky . First and foremost , the term `` salvation '' or in hebrew , Yeshua , does not relate to personal salvation , heaven or hell etc.It is not an individualistic concept , but is more specifically used in reference to deliverance from exile , a future messianic era where moshiach , lit . meaning `` an anointed one '' , will bring peace to the world and lead the entire jewish nation to congregate in israel at the future third temple . While there is no temple , the jews are considered a scattered people . This future period is a time of peace for everyone . It is not exclusionary . The world will presumably be business as usual . But people , enlightened by a high ethical and moral understanding , will get along better with each other . And war and strife and fear will not be a staple of daily life ( as they are now , during this period of exile ) . Thus it will be a time of deliverance from persecution and plague for everyone alike.As for going to heaven vs. hell , judaism teaches us not to focus our energies on this aspect of existence so that we do n't constantly think about getting rewarded ( see ethics of our fathers ) . And rather do good deeds for the sake of doing good deeds.All in all , according to judaism , if you 're a good person , you 're going to heaven !",0

"Can anyone help me with algabra ? i do n't understand the geomitry part of a algabra it confuses me I do n't understand how to simplify square routes . When you square a number you are multiplying it by itself . For example 3ft x 3ft = 9 square feet or 3 squared = 9 . But if you had a real square ( a box top with equal sides like a huge pizza box ) and each side was 3 feet , the area of the box would be 3ft x 3ft = 9 sq-ft. You can think of squaring a number as the geometric operation of taking the sides of a square and multiplying them to get the square area as shown.Taking a square root is just the opposite . You start with the square area of the box top and find the sides . If the box top is 9 square feet you want to know the value of any two sides ( the other two sides will be the same ) . a square area of 9 sq-ft = 3ft x 3ft . There are methods for calculating square feet or it can be done using a hand calculator , but it helps to know what is really going on.When you square a number or find the square root of a number you can also use pure numbers ( 3 or 9 rather than 3ft or 9 sq-ft ) and there does n't need to be any real pizza box involved even though you use the word `` square .

"is a mp3 better than an i-pod ? In my opinion , i would think that an MP3 player is better than an iPod . i have several of reasons why.1 . There are pretty much two formats that will work on MP3 players : MP3 and WMA . On iPods , you can only download one format that you ca n't actually listen to on your computer.2 . For an iPod , you have to buy music off an online store . for an MP3 player , if you own the music , you can put it on the MP3 player.3 . iPods tend to cost WAY more than MP3 players.4 . the only reason why iPods are more popular is because that they have good ads and word of mouth got around fast.so , if you are only going to be using it for listening to music , an MP3 player would be better . Likewise , there are things that an iPod can do that others ca n't . iPods generally hold a lot more songs than MP3 players . also , the new iPods can download videos onto them , so you can actually watch music videos on your iPod ! you can also look at picture slideshows on your iPod as well.so , in conclusion if you do n't want to spend as much and you only want to listen to music , choose an MP3 player . if you want to view music videos and pictures , choose an iPod.hope i helped !",0

"Why does like charges repel each other ? This is a very good question . Ultimately it comes down to being one of the fundamental features of our universe . But it can also be broken down a bit.Like charges repel , and opposite ones attract because of differences in their electric fields . But the electric fields are really part of the larger electromagnetic force . This force is mediated by photons ( light ) and , indeed light is a self-propagating electromagnetic wave.But there are also three other fundamental forces : gravity , the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force . The strong nuclear force is well , strong , but very short range . It holds the protons and neutrons together in a nucleus ( otherwise the like charges from the protons would break up every nucleus except hydrogen ) . The weak nuclear force is sort of a miscellaneous , and comes into play in certain radioactive decay sequences.In the 1980s it was shown that the electromagnetic and weak forces are actually the same thing . The difference we observe is that the universe is , relatively speaking , `` cold , '' and these two parts have separated out . It is sort of like having a glass of steam ( one thing ) which cools down until there is water and ice ( two things ) . The water and ice look a lot different from each other , but are fundamentally the same . In the same way in the very , very early universe when things were a lot hotter , the electromagnetic and weak forces were identical - like the steam in the analogy.More recently it was found that the strong force can also be linked to the `` electroweak '' force in the same sort of manner . The mathematical and physical details are different from `` electroweak unification '' but the basic principle is the same . It was from this Grand Unification of the electromagnetic , weak , and strong forces the the theoretical notion of quarks came . This GUT has been tested and the experiments show it is right on target.The next step is to connect the electro-weak-strong force with gravity . This is a lot harder because the first three are understood in the context of Quantum Mechanics and gravity is understood with General Relativity . QM and GR are not compatible on some basic principles.One approach that is being tried to combine QM and GR is with string theory . To make this work the universe is composed of 11 dimensions , the usual 3-spatial and 1-temporal dimentsion , plus 7 very , very small spatial dimensions . If these extra 7 are looped around themselves so that they are vastly `` smaller '' than a proton , we 'd never really notice them.What string theory seems to suggest is that there are just some ways to make stuff in the universe , and one of these ways is to create the `` force particles '' that mediate the fundamental forces.So , extrapolating that , and realizing that string theory is in no sense proven , we can say that `` like charges repel '' because of the geometry ( the 11-dimensions ) of the universe.But string theory remains far from being complete mathematically , and no one can really make solid predictions yet to test it . So , you can also fall back on the answer in the first paragraph .",0

"Why does TV always show gangsters and thugs holding pistols sideways ? Why does TV always show gangsters and thugs holding pistols sideways instead of the proper vertical orientation ? Is it just for the `` cool '' factor ? The same reason they hold microphones clear to the top thereby losing much of the useful pickup characteristics designed into the microphone . One person does it and someone thinks it 's cool then the next one does it and so on . Nevermind the fact that the sideways orientation of the firearm makes accuracy nearly impossible and kickback from the firearm dangerous , not to mention ejected hot shell casings will fly up into your face and go down your shirt that is cooly unbuttoned . How about the baggy pants that make running impossible , or the light up tennis shoes that make it easy for a police officer to follow a perp in the dark . Much of `` cool '' fashion is so foolish it 's laughable . I still have n't even figured out why the vocalists keep grabbing their crotch area then pointing at the audience while taking giant steps sideways . What is the most absurd about all of this is that all of the people following in lockstep repeating all of this crap are convinced that they are rugged individualists expressing their own unique personality . In reality they are simply reflecting what they have seen on the big glass brain stealer ( That 's TV ) . Well I got ta go now . It 's time for me to put on my stocking cap .

Please tell me why you think a bullet fired from a sideways gun would act differently than a bullet fired from a gun held correctly ? Maybe they should hold it upside down so it will fly out backwards and the flat back end of the bullet leave a bigger hole ?",0

"what does the government hide from the people ? Things that would harm the 'security ' of the government .

Since they do n't want a wrong impression of what they have screwed up in the past , they hide pretty much everything they use to make decisions and the actions they take under the premise of 'the interest of national security ' . This could be technology which would help enemies ( so-called ; expanding who constitutes an 'enemy ' greatly expands what can be kept secret ) , anything that would ruin our economy or the main corporations which support it , anything that might reveal how our weapons work , policies about how things are REALLY kept secret , plans for keeping the government ( and friends ) safe after a major attack , strategic sources of materials which are n't publicly disclosed already , scientific data that might cause panic , scientific data that might cause distrust of the government , inventions which could be used as weapons ( yes , they monitor patent applications ) , and all the usual things like who is a spy for who , how we monitor communications , how other countries monitor our communications ( and sell us the info ) , how much money our intelligence agencies spend , and who in our country is suspected of being a threat to any of the above things.I think that pretty much covers it .

"can i have a child if i have crohns and what are the risk ? can i have achid if I have crohns and what are the risk ? Most women with Crohn 's disease are able to deliver healthy , full-term babies ; however , many people have questions about the impact Crohn 's disease will have on a pregnancy . Women who have Crohn 's disease may be concerned about whether or not they have the physical capacity to carry a pregnancy to term , while men with Crohn 's disease may worry whether medication has affected the viability of their sperm.Will we be able to conceive a baby ? Women with an active case of Crohn 's disease may have difficulty conceiving . Men who use sulfasalazine , a commonly used drug to treat Crohn 's disease , may become temporarily infertile because the sulfa compound can decrease sperm production . If a man is trying to father a child , he should ask his physician about 5-ASA medications which can treat Crohn 's disease without risking fertility . Women with Crohn ’ s disease who are planning to become pregnant should consult a doctor.How can Crohn 's disease affect my pregnancy ? While most women with Crohn 's disease are able to carry a full-term pregnancy and deliver a healthy baby , it is important for you to know that your disease may affect your pregnancy in the following ways : A cesarean section may be required for some women who have Crohn 's disease with complications , including abscesses or fistulas of the rectum or vagina.If a woman is experiencing an active bout of Crohn 's disease during pregnancy she has a 2 to 3 times increased risk of miscarriage , delivering the baby prematurely , or stillbirth.If a woman has active Crohn 's disease at the time of conception , the disease usually runs its course in a similar way to the pattern that was experienced before pregnancy.If a woman is experiencing active Crohn 's disease prior to a pregnancy , she may notice that the symptoms of her disease worsen right after becoming pregnant and during the first 3 months of the pregnancy . The disease may also intensify right after the delivery of her baby . It 's important to remember that every pregnancy is different . There is no evidence showing that if you experience severe symptoms during your pregnancy , subsequent pregnancies will also be difficult.Should I change my diet now that I am pregnant ? It is important for all pregnant women to eat a healthy and well-balanced diet . As a woman with Crohn 's disease , in addition to eating a standard diet recommended during pregnancy , your obstetrician and gastroenterologist may also recommend some special foods , vitamins , and minerals . If your Crohn 's disease is being treated with sulfasalazine , it is important that your diet be supplemented with folic acid , since this is an essential nutrient in preventing certain birth defects.Are medications for Crohn 's disease safe to take during my pregnancy ? All women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant should avoid taking any unnecessary medications . However , if you are experiencing active Crohn 's disease , it may be necessary for you to be treated with medication.If you ’ re a pregnant woman and considering drug therapy , you should speak with both your gastroenterologist and your obstetrician , so that each healthcare provider is well informed about current health issues when recommending treatment options.Are any diagnostic tests safe during pregnancy ? All pregnant women should avoid having X-rays , especially during the first 12 weeks , unless it is absolutely necessary . Presently , MRIs are sometimes used , but more information is needed . The following tests may also be used for pregnant women who may have Crohn 's disease for the management of their disease : Abdominal ultrasoundSigmoidoscopyRectal biopsyUpper endoscopyColonoscopyWill previous surgery for Crohn 's disease affect my pregnancy ? There is no evidence that a bowel resection due to Crohn 's disease affects a woman 's pregnancy . The opposite actually",0

"How would you explain the word , Elysium ? and what other words mean the same ? In Greek mythology , Elysium was a section of the Underworld ( the spelling Elysium is a Latinization of the Greek word Elysion ) . `` Elysium is an obscure and mysterious name that evolved from a designation of a place or person struck by lightning , enelysion , enelysios . ( Burkert 1985 p. 198 ) The Elysian fields , or sometimes Elysian plains , were the final resting place of the souls of the heroic and the virtuous . Two passages in Homer established for Greeks the nature of the Afterlife : the dreamed apparition of the dead Patroclus in the Iliad and the more daring boundary-breaking visit in Odyssey . Greek traditions concerning funerary ritual were reticent , but the Homeric examples encouraged other heroic visits , in the myth cycles accreted upon Theseus and upon Heracles ( Campbell 1948 ; Ruck and Staples 1994 ) .The Elysian Fields lay on the western margin of the earth , by the encircling stream of Oceanus ( Odyssey ) , and there the mortal relatives of the king of the gods were transported , without tasting death , to enjoy an immortality of bliss ( Odyssey book iv : 563 ) . Hesiod refers to the Isles of the Blessed ( makarôn nêsoi ) in the Western Ocean ( Works and Days ) . Pindar makes it a single Isle . Walter Burkert notes the connection with the motif of far-off Dilmun : `` Thus Achilles is transported to the White Isle and becomes the Ruler of the Black Sea , and Diomedes becomes the divine lord of an Adriatic island . '' ( Burkert 1985 , p. 198 ) .In Elysium were fields of the pale liliaceous asphodel , and poplars grew . There stood the gates that led to the house of Ais ( in Attic dialect `` Hades '' ) .",0

"Where can I find a cheap LCD Monitor ? There are a ton of specs for monitors , which ones are important and which ones just make it cost more ? I 'd like to scrap my big monitor if I can find a good one . The main thing with LCD monitors is response time . If you play games a low response time causes ghosting effects which makes the image appear blurred , one with a fast response time ( 16ms or better ) will not have this problem . You are in luck , the prices of LCD monitors have plummeted in the past few years and you can get a very good one from either Viewsonic or Samsung for around $ 200 for a 17 '' LCD monitor which has a resolution of 1280 x 1024 and 15 '' monitors have a resolution of 1024 x 768 . I would get a 17 '' . There are n't many other factors to consider besides maybe contrast ratio which is measured in ratios like 450:1 but tests have shown each manufacturer uses their own scale and some 450:1 monitors made by Samsung and Viewsonic are actually brighter and sharper than 600:1 monitors made by off-brand companies.At any rate , you ca n't go wrong with Viewsonic or Samsung and you just ca n't beat Newegg for selection or service.17 '' Viewsonics here , http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp ?

Has anyone underwent Laser eye surgery ? What are the risks and the cost incurred ? Does it work for all types of vision problem ? Does it need any kind of maintenance ? I had laser vision surgery a few years ago in one of my eyes . I did n't get it done in the other because I wanted to be able to read without glasses with one eye and see in the distance with the other without glasses . It worked out well for me this way and I never need glasses ( except sunglasses ) . I have n't need any kind of maintenance after the 1st couple of visits . Locally it costs about $ 500 per eye but it probably will be different by where you live . You will have to ask an eye doctor about your other questions but keep in mind you only have to get one eye done if you still want to be able to read without glasses . Good luck .,0

The Jews said no , you are not from God or God.. you know what happened next.. Then the Christians Started their own religion and their own set of holey books based on Jesus 's life ... Then , another guy named mohammed came along.. he said he was a prophet of God..The Christians and jews said.. i do n't think so.. you are a fake ... anyway.. his followers became known as the muslims.. has nothing to with the MOOON ... Islam in arabic means peace.. has nothing to do with the moon ... Moving on ... The muslims have the quran ... The muslims believe in same God as Christians and Jews ... but they do not use same holey book ... MAIN POINT ... don ’ t ' listen to what crazies out there say ... All three have same god ... but all look at things differently ... Jews dont believe in jesus , the are still waiting for him to come ... The Christians believe Jesus is either God or the son of god and they do not believe that mohammed has anything to do with God ... that he 's a false messenger..

"Who can tell me about Frances Farmer ? she 's was from seattle i think Frances Elena Farmer ( September 19 , 1913 , Seattle , Washington – August 1 , 1970 , Indianapolis , Indiana ) was an American film actress.Early life , career and marriageFarmer was born and raised in Seattle , Washington . In 1931 , at age 17 , she entered and won $ 100 in a writing contest sponsored by Scholastic Magazine with her controversial essay God Dies . In 1935 , as a student at the University of Washington , she won a subscription contest for the leftist newspaper The Voice of Action . First prize was a trip to the Soviet Union , which she took despite her mother 's strong objections . These two incidents led to accusations that Farmer was both an atheist and a Communist . Farmer studied drama at the University of Washington . During the 1930s its drama department productions were considered citywide cultural events and attended accordingly . While there she starred in diverse plays including Helen of Troy , Everyman and Uncle Vanya . In 1935 she starred in the school 's production of Alien Corn , speaking foreign languages , playing the piano and receiving rave reviews in what was the longest running play in the department 's history at the time.1936Returning from the Soviet Union in the summer of 1935 Farmer stopped in New York City , hoping to launch a legitimate theater career . Instead , she was referred to Paramount talent scout Oscar Serlin who arranged for a screen test . Paramount offered her a 7-year contract . Farmer signed it in New York on her 22nd birthday ( September 19 , 1935 ) and moved to Hollywood . She had top billing in two well-received 1936 `` B '' films and that same year was cast opposite Bing Crosby in Rhythm On The Range . Also in 1936 she was loaned to Samuel Goldwyn to appear in Come and Get It , based on the novel by Edna Ferber . Her portrayals of both the mother and daughter were praised by the public and critics , some of whom wrote of her potential to become a major star . She also married her first husband , actor Leif Erickson , in 1936.A rebellious starFarmer was not entirely satisfied with her career , however . She felt stifled by Paramount 's tendency to cast her in films which depended on her looks more than her talent and her naturally outspoken demeanor made her seem uncooperative and contemptuous . In an age when the studios dictated every facet of a star 's life , Farmer rebelled against the studio 's control and although she allowed herself to be put through cosmetic `` makeovers '' and photographed in bathing suits for publicity purposes , she resisted every attempt they made to glamourize her private life , refusing to attend Hollywood parties or to date other stars for the gossip columns . At the time , she was sympathetically described as being indifferent about the clothing she wore and was said to drive an older-model `` green roadster , '' which according to a columnist , once broke down on Melrose Avenue , blocking traffic as Farmer pushed the stricken car to the side , much to the consternation of the studio 's publicity department.Hoping to enhance her reputation as a serious actress , she left Hollywood in 1937 to do summer stock on the East Coast . She had already attracted the attention of Harold Clurman and Clifford Odets and appeared in the Group Theatre production of Odets ' play Golden Boy in a performance which at first received highly mixed reviews ( Time magazine commented that she had been miscast ) . However by 1938 when the production had embarked on a national tour , regional critics from Washington D.C. to Chicago had given her rave reviews.Farmer also had an affair with Odets but he was married to actress Luise Rainer and did n't offer Farmer a commitment . Farmer felt betrayed when Odets suddenly ended the relationship , believing he had used her drawing power to further the success of his play . She returned to Hollywood , somewhat chastened , willing to continue her movie career but still on her terms . She arranged with Paramount to s",0

"The IRS said i had to pay a penalty . i filed a dispute . am i legally obligated to pay unless they follow up ? the IRS never wrote back once i filed the dispute . am i legally allowed not to pay ? You did n't say what the penalty was for ( late filing , late payment , interest , trust fund penalties , etc. ) . Nor did you state who is handling your dispute ( IRS Appeals , Collection Due Process , Tax Court ) . There 's slightly different rules depending on what 's going on.The basic process for handling penalties and disputes is outlined on the IRS website.In general , the IRS will investigate whether you are responsible for the penalty , and will send up a notice informing you that the penalty was waived or that you really do owe the penalty . Interest will accrue if you really do owe the penalty , but you have n't paid it yet.Generally , I advise my clients to pay all penalties in full , and then dispute the penalties . This shows a good faith effort , and stops additional penalties and interest from being added to the account . If we lose the dispute , at least the client paid only the penalty and not additional interest . If we win , the client gets his money back.I hope this helps . Let us know how your dispute with the IRS turns out.Best wishes.William",0

"Why does science and religion conflict with each other so much ? Old Goat is correct . It would help to know specifics . But consider just ONE example . The book of Job is the oldest book in the Bible . It even predates Moses . So , in that period of time , how did other cultures view the earth ? Flat , supported by Atlas or giant elephants ... But look what it reads in the book of Job ... `` God hangs the earth on nothing . '' And in Isaiah it reads , `` It is God who sits above the circle of the earth . '' That word `` circle '' in Hebrew is ball or sphere . So if people poopoo the Bible with their lofty scientific thinking , they have probably not even read the Bible to check . I know scientists who have read the Bible , and are amazed at how accurate it is.We know that all matter is made up of atoms and electrons . I nor any scientist has ever seen an electron . But because of scientific study , we know they exist . The Bible reads in Hebrews 11:3 ...

"how to treat diarrhea in a toddler. ? While rarely serious when treated properly , diarrhea can send your toddler to the hospital if he becomes dehydrated , so your first concern should be giving him enough liquids . If your toddler is n't also vomiting , it should be fairly easy to give him extra water to drink . If he ca n't keep liquids down , though , or if his diarrhea is severe ( a watery bowel movement every two hours or more ) , call his doctor , who may suggest a pediatric electrolyte solution , like Pedialyte , ReVital , or a generic brand . These solutions are available in drugstores and come in flavors that most toddlers will readily drink if they 're dehydrated.Avoid sweetened fluids like sodas ( including ginger ale ) , athletic drinks ( like Gatorade ) , Jell-O , sugar water , and undiluted fruit juices . All of these contain sugar that will draw water into the intestine and make the diarrhea worse . Also do n't use anti-diarrhea medication unless the doctor prescribes it.Doctors now advise continuing to feed solid foods to a child with diarrhea . While there 's nothing wrong with feeding your toddler the classic BRAT diet ( bananas , rice , applesauce , and dry toast ) , the AAP says any foods made up of complex carbohydrates , such as rice , wheat , potatoes , bread , and cereal , as well as lean meats , yogurt , fruits , and vegetables , are safe to eat . ( If your toddler temporarily refuses to eat , do n't worry . As long as he stays hydrated his appetite should return in a day or two . ) Studies have shown that live bacterial cultures , found in yogurt , are a safe and effective way to cut down on the amount and duration of diarrhea . It 's an easy way to treat the problem , especially if your toddler loves the taste of yogurt . Just be sure to buy yogurt with lactobacillus , or live cultures.If your toddler is uncomfortable during a bout of diarrhea , try to cuddle and comfort him as much as possible and keep his bottom dry . Use care , tenderness , and plenty of diaper cream when changing him , since it 's easy for your toddler 's bottom to become red and irritated from the loose stools .",0

You are correct that 45kVA would be 150 AMPs . You probably should think about oversizing the generator for the surge that happens when the welder is first turned on . The 45KVA is for 230 for 110 volts you would need half of the 45KVA or 22.5KVAAt least that is the way it calculated for me using those tools.So pretty much you need a generator that can deliver 150 amps .

"Do you feel that ignorance about science reflects badly on religious people ? As a scientist , I have been quite taken aback by what seem like illogical uninformed statements , sometimes very strongly worded , by those in the religious community ( particularly Christian fundamentalists ) . Statements like:1. evolution depends on carbon dating2 . the big bang is part of evolution3 . if you accept the big bang you are an atheist/offensive to God/damned/etc4 . if you accept evolution you are an atheist/doing the work of the devil/damned/etc5 . illogical , intellectually dishonest definitions of the word `` theory '' in the context of `` scientific theory '' 6. irrational , intellectually dishonest definitions of what is `` scientific '' or what `` religion '' is.Frankly , making statements like this , and wandering into the scientific realm speaking nonsense really reflects badly on the religious community . It would be as if prominent scientists went and started to dictate to religious groups about what they could and could not do , or how they could worship . I feel that ignorance of any sort reflects badly on anyone . I think the problem many religious people have is that they feel science and religion are mutually exclusive , and that the sole purpose of science is to debunk religion . I 'm of another school of thought , that science and faith can coexist quite nicely . I 'm in good company , too : Johann Kepler , one of the greatest astronomers who ever lived : `` “ I thank Thee , my Creator and Lord , that Thou hast given me this joy in Thy creation , this delight in the works of Thy hands ; I have shown the excellency of Thy works unto man , so far as my mind was able to comprehend Thine infinity ” '' Blaise Pascal , mathematician and philosopher , discoverer of what is now called Pascal 's Law : `` ..the only perfect knowledge [ comes ] through Christian revelation '' Sir Isaac Newton : `` This most beautiful system of the sun , planets , and comets , could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being '' Louis Pasteur : `` ..spontaneous generation ( like materialism in general ) threaten [ s ] the very concept of God the Creator '' Wernher von Braun , one of the world ’ s foremost rocket engineers : `` It is as difficult for me to understand a scientist who does not acknowledge the presence of a superior rationality behind the existence of the universe as it is to comprehend a theologian who would deny the advance of science .

"How long can a person live with with the full blown aids virus , also can they fight off the flu , common colds ? We do n't really use the term `` full blown AIDS '' anymore . Most often we look at T-cell counts . T-cells are in your blood . They are part of the immune system . They are what identify things that make you sick . HIV attacks T-cells and eventually kills them all off.We also look at something called a `` viral load . '' It simply tells how much of the virus is in your blood.The lower your T-cells are , and the higher your viral load is - the sicker you may become.If a person with AIDS takes their medications they can live a long and healthy life . I have known people with less than 10 T-cells who have been relatively healthy for a few years . There are medications that can prevent other types of infections that affect people with AIDS too.So , how long can you live ? No one really knows .

"Terrorist , rebel or freedom fighter ? What ’ s the difference between a terrorist , rebel or a freedom fighter ? At one point in history a number of American ’ s were considered terrorists by the loyal New York residents which had stronger ties to the British . As time went by and support weakened , they became rebels , fighting for US freedom.Is terrorism relative to ones location and beliefs ? I think the answer is in the targets . 'Legitimate ' Rebels/Freedom fighters will use tactical and strategic attacks against a government to gain leverage for their beliefs , or to cause attrition of the enemies resources to force them to the negotiating table , the way the revolutionaries did . Guerilla warfare is neccessary when facing superior numbers , but cowardly attacks on civilians is what makes a terrorist . The public at large ends up being the target . In these attacks the purpose seems to be to attract outside attention , and to try and de-stabilize a government by attacking public support for it 's policies . A government in power will always try and attach the most negative connotation to it 's enemies , so in British eyes they were terrorists but if you analyze the methodology of their warfare they were not . Collateral damage occurs in all warfare . Warriors minimize it , terrorists strive for it.Civilian targets : Terrorist.Government , military , infrastructure targets : Lawful warfare.If anyone were to organize resistance to an unjust government , even when that resistance is justified and even encouraged by laws of the land , that resistance would have to focus on legitimate targets rather than the population at large to be considered freedom fighters instead of terrorists .",0

"is yahoo better or google ? My answer is google for the following reasons : Pros of Google : As a seach engine , google has the best relevance and presents the results in a way that I find easy to decide what pages are best for me . Its the best in terms of researching information.For makin money , a # 1 on google is worth many times more than a # 1 on yahoo . Yahoo ! blocks the top of the SERPs with sponsored ads.Google also has a neat interface . Yahoo is not bad too , but its interface is not that neat . The reason for that being it to be a portal . I think a nice interface is very important since people will come back more often if so.The relevance of search results make its 'Feeling Lucky ' feature pretty useful . Firefox address bar by defaults goes to 1 site listed on your search results.Google has tried to stay away from Spam/ misleading sites better than other search engines.Cons of Google : However , few problems with google , its web crawler dose n't capture hyperlinks from PDF files stored on net , a feature which Yahoo provides.Also , Google at present does not provide an index for video aggregation through the web crawler , a feature which Altavista provided since 1999 . The problems include accuracy of the media file . That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.Due to a larger share of 'searching ' community , Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs .

"some ink fell on a shirt . which ones are the best to remove the stain ethanol , vinegar or ethanol and vinegar ? Okay , here 's the real chemistry of how it works : Ink is an organic substance . Organic substances usually are n't charged . Vinegar , on the other hand , is a solution made of charged particles . For that reason , vinegar is good for removing things with charge , but probably wo n't do a good job with ink.I recommend ethanol . Actually , I 've used ethanol to remove ink lots of times , so I 'm pretty confident it 'll work.A bit of advice , though : when the ethanol dissolves the ink it might spread it out , making the spot bigger . The best advice I have for this is keep trying and test it in an inconspicuous area first if you ca n't bear to have a bigger spot on your shirt .",0

"am i at risk for std ? Hi , I have a concern and I was hoping that some of you might be able to help me . Last night my girlfriend came over to my house and we had unprotected vaginal sex . It was her first time ( meaning she was a virgin ) . There was no blood or anything like that at all . This is the first time that I have had unprotected sex . We didnt perform any oral sex though last night but we have in the past few weeks . I just wanted to know , if it 's possible that I caught anything ( even though she was a virgin ) . STD or HIV ? one last note : A girl performed oral sex on me last december ( early december ) . Does that influence anything ? Thank you in advance If your girl is a virgin and she has not been infected by any STD by sharing needles or bad blood transfusion you 're not going to catch anything from her.You can receive an STD by Salival transmission so if the girl who went down on you has an STD you may have received it.Remember that life is an STD . If you 're having unprotected vaginal sex you need to make sure you are at a point in your life where you 'll be able to support a child . If you 're not then you should take every precaution against pregnancy . Remember that the only method that is 100 % effective is abstinence ( well and oral I guess ) .",0
"Why is an abortion so easy to get ? Although I think abortion should remain legal , I think it should be harder to get one . All you need is $ 500 . Some girls use it as their only form of birth control . There are many states in which a girl under 18 does n't even have to have her parents permission . [ You ca n't even get your EARS peirced without parental consent . ] Maybe there should be mandatory counseling before and after . Before to go throught he options in handling an unwanted pregnancy ( adoption and so forth ) . And then after to deal with emotional effects of the abortion . What do you think ? if it was hard , women and girls would go to underground clinics , secret places or somewhere where they can get one . its the law of supply and demand . plus the medical consequenses of a backroom abortion could be devastating . at least clinical is safe . who knows what could happen in an uncertified environment . also , clinical provides JOBS , AND THEY MAKE A TON OF MONEY . just like cigarettes or alcohol , if they know they can kill you why is it legal , simple -- MONEY AND JOBS . lobbyists for these groups donate to politicians to get legislation in their favor . money talks . if abortion was illegal all the clinics , doctors , nurses , support staff would be unemployed and have to find another job , not good for the economy . thats why they do n't shut down big business , tobacco farmers would be devastated and the grain farmers , distillers , and distributors would have no job . it all about money , politics and keeping your job and the government getting the TAX DOLLARS generated from these enterprises . its sad but thats the system governments use to generate revenue",0
"do i have to send thank you notes for christmas ? The rule is ... if the giver is in a different house from you , you NEED to send one . Do n't just send a blank one though ! Here is a fabulous guide on what to say : There is a six-point formula to the proper thank-you : Learn it , know it , memorize it – and it will never fail you.1 . Greet the Giver Dear Aunt Sally , That ’ s the easy part , but you ’ d be surprised how many people forget it . Dale Carnegie taught us people love to hear their own names and Direct Marketing is sure we also love to read them in ink . That ’ s right , ink . Blue-black is always the number-one choice , but black will suffice in a pinch . Don ’ t let a whimsical marker color be the most stunning part of your note : instead let the words sing without the amplification of rainbow hues . Even if your handwriting is poor , you must still hand-write your notes . Do not type them or , worse , use a word processor . No excuses.2 . Express Your Gratitude Thank you so much for the slippers.This first paragraph seems like it would be the easiest , but it is actually the most complicated . Beware the just writing trap . You are not ‘ just writing to say ’ as in I am just writing to say ; that ’ s stating the obvious . If the giver is reading , clearly you have already written . Therefore use the present-perfect tense , which essentially means write as if whatever you say is happening in the moment.Also – and this is important – never directly mention money . ‘ Thank you for the hundred bucks ’ could instead be ‘ Thank you for your generosity. ’ All cash denominations become ‘ your generosity ’ or ‘ your kindness. ’ If you feel the giver overspent , the farthest you can go is appreciated : ‘ Your generosity is appreciated , ’ or ‘ It is such an extravagant gift – your kindness is appreciated. ’ If you ’ re writing to thank someone for an intangible ( such as them putting you up at their place while you were in town for the weekend ) , first define what the intangible thing is , and then make the gift sound as attractive as possible . In other words , don ’ t say : ‘ Thanks for letting us crash at your place. ’ Instead say : ‘ Thank you for your hospitality. ’ Don ’ t worry if it sounds too simple ; the point of writing the note is to create a simple expression of a heartfelt sentiment.3 . Discuss Use It gets very chilly here in the winter , so they will get a lot of use when winter comes.Say something nice about the item and how you will use it . Let ’ s say it ’ s something you actually love and use incessantly – then say so : ‘ Ever since I got the slippers I have only taken them off to shower and go to work . I ’ d wear them to the office if I thought I could get away with it. ’ But don ’ t lie , even though some etiquette books may tell you it ’ s okay . After all , there ’ s always a truth that can be extracted . Let ’ s say you hate the slippers . How to say thanks ? Find the one thing about them that ’ s nice and discuss it – but don ’ t get carried away . ‘ They are such a lovely shade of blue ’ works , and is more honest than ‘ These slippers make my heart sing like a choir of angels , ’ which is overkill . If it was a gesture , like letting you stay at their place , you can follow the lines of ‘ It ’ s so nice to make a personal connection while traveling . I really appreciated my time with your family. ’ If the gift was cash , allude to how you will use the money , but do not itemize your planned purchases line by line , instead simply say : ‘ It will be a great help when we purchase our new home/toaster/lava lamp/whatever. ’ You can get arty here , but not flowery . It ’ s a fine line . Small , realistic statements like ‘ I put the flowers on the kitchen table and they are still looking fresh and beautiful after a week , ’ or ‘ I don ’ t know which is more fun , actually using the Cuisinart , or reading recipes and thinking I could do that in the Cuisinart ! ’ Having fun is alright , so have at it.4 .

"what is the purpose of the reverse stapling feature of a stapler ? On a hand stapler you have a silver metal anvil on the base of the stapler . This anvil is where the staple legs are formed either in an inward ( standard clinch ) or outward ( pinning ) fashion . If your staples are forming outward , this means that the anvil has been turned . To resolve , push the button under your anvil upward . This will raise the anvil , now rotate the anvil 180 degrees . This will change the position of the forming slots.Pinning ( the staple legs are formed outward ) is an old style of securing papers . You would be able to remove the staple without damaging your papers , and add additional papers . One draw-back to this style of fastening is that the staple leg is exposed and will catch on other objects .",0
"Are pheromones found in human beings ? Humans have one or more pheromones ( originally called `` exaltolides '' ) , presumed to exist for some years , but formally accepted to exist in 1986 . They are strongest in women during the time period around ovulation and work subliminally ( at concentrations too small to recognize as an odor ) . They are responsible for women who live together , as in a dorm , synchronizing their ovulatory cycles . Men emit some at a regular rate , but the importance of this is not understood . At stronger concentrations these pheromones have a musky , even offensive , smell - thus the prevalence of musk-type perfumes trying to mimic the effect . It is the buildup of exaltolides in the air that may cause the heightened social activities in everybody at a crowded cocktail party or a dance . The increased body temperature from physical activity will increase evaporation into the air .",0

"Have i screwed myself over ? If i slacked off for the first two years of highschool and failed a lot of classes , but now in my third year am making A 's and B 's have i screwed myself out of going to a good college like a University ? Not necessarily . Many colleges look at both your overall gpa and your last two years gpa . So , hopefully you will do very well this year and next year . Remember that you only have two more semesters to get grades before most applications are due ( you have this spring 's grades and next fall 's grades ) so it is critical that you do well . Remember , that gpa is one very important factor in admissions , but most colleges also want you to have high SAT or ACT scores , so you need to prepare for doing well on this test . You can study for it , and I like to have people study for it by buying a bunch of practice tests and taking a practice test a week for 8-12 weeks . Take a test , score it , and then look up every item you got wrong . Then repeat . You should see your scores improving.Finally , colleges really do want to see that you have some significant interests within and outside of school . So , you also need to show that you have leadership potential , or talent , or community impact . Clubs , hobbies , and community service can all be a part . Finally , you really need to be able to do a good personal statement . It probably would be helpful to address your poor grades , why you had them and what you learned about yourself so that you could turn it around . Be able to address your values and why you and the school you are applying to are a good match . Hang in there , do well , and remember that college applications are multifaceted .",0

"How are North and South America considered one continent , but Europe and Asia are considered seperate ? This question ( http : //answers.yahoo.com/question/index ? qid=1006020706083 ) inspired my question . I was always taught that there are seven continents . I personally would consider Eurpoe and Asia to be united before I would ever consider North and South America to be united . If you think otherwise ( or if you agree with me ) , please explain your answer . All 7 continents were joined together billions of years ago . However through time , they gradually split up , resulting in North and South America , and Australia to be separate from the main body-Europe , Asia and Africa.I figured because Europe and Asia had different coloured people which each had their unique tradition and customs . As they ruled differently due to customs , tradition and prctices , they probably decided to each govern their own way and thus they spilt up into 'different continents ' , though Europe and Asia are on the same piece of land .",0

"why world think that muslims are terrorists ? ? Muslims are terrorists if all Germans are nazis , Americans are gangsters , Columbians are drug dealers , Italians are mafia members and ... .I think thats because the only news from muslims which news companies spread is about terrorism.Propaganda has great powers and it can make you believe that muslims are terrorist.After cold war when the danger of communism vanished western governments need an enemy and there was n't anyone better than muslims.Maybe it is true that some famous terrorist are muslim but it is also true that muslim countries have suffered from many unwanted problems e.g . afghanestan which was american front during cold war for controlling the communism movement in middle east which is one of the most important oil producers in world and believe me , there is nothing remained there except ruined cities and mountain and minefield and vast fields of poppy which is used to make opium and heroin in great amounts . this is a proper place for terrorism to grow . so I think muslims are wrongfuly accused .",0

"how can add 2 harddrives to my computer ? Each IDE channel can accept 2 devices . Most motherboards come with 2 IDEs . So 4 devices . Your CD/DVD drive will also be plugged into this . So , if there are no other IDE devices plugged in you can install 2 more hard disks . Each channel should have a Master and Slave . These are controlled by small jumpers on the back of the devices . This has to be done correctly.Some motherboards also have SATA connections if these are not used then you can use SATA hard disks.If you dont want to open up the computer and fiddle about with cables and jumpers , then get external hard disks with USB and can be plugged in to the USB socket in your computer . Much easier.Good LuckBattery Wizard",0
"Why do so many women like bad boy types ? The debate of `` nice guys vs. bad boys '' has been raging for quite a long time . The nature of being a `` nice guy '' , however , is commonly misunderstood . It is believed that being polite , considerate , friendly , tender , romantic , etc . is what being a `` nice guy '' is all about and thus those qualities should be avoided , as it is the `` bad boy '' , the rude , the inconsiderate , the impolite , the rough guy who always gets the girl while the `` nice guy '' is waiting outside in the pouring rain with flowers in his hand.It does n't mean that women prefer rude over polite , inconsiderate over considerate , etc . It all becomes clear when we look at a very important issue often overlooked when trying to define what makes the `` bad boys '' beat the `` nice guys '' when it comes to getting the girls . It is sexuality - the `` bad boys '' are not afraid to show that they are sexual beings , while the `` nice guys '' hide their sexuality as a part of their agenda of being friendly , polite , and courteous towards women .",0

"Do You Belive th Entire Bible ? Do you belive in the entire bible , including Genisis ( not evolution ) , the New Testemant , and everything that God ( and Jesus ) says or commands ? Yes . But not the contorted , twisted , taken out of context versions that were edited to fit someones personal desires . Somethings in the bible dont quite sound right , but when you understand it and read the whole story of whats going on it all makes sense . Its like zooming out from just a few threads to see the big beautiful quilt . Its all interlinked and beautifully orchestrated . Its hard to see the whole thing when you focus just on a couple threads here and there.Faith is essential for belief.I find it neccessary to rebuke this blisschameleon , '' Evolution proves adam and eve wrong . '' Evolution is not proven . Also why are we not still evolving . The bible says God made each one according to its kind . `` And our knowledge of other solar stystems proves that there is n't just one sun in the entire universe . '' God has one Son , Jesus Christ . He made light and darkness . Please direct me to the scripture where you claim it says `` God made one sun , and one solar system . `` `` Humans traveling to space proves the tower of Babalon wrong . '' The destruction of Babylon was not over how far from the Earth the Babylonians were making themselves . It was about their attitude . Their wanting to build the tower to make themselves equal to God . Certainly this would not make it so , but it had nothing to do with a tower . `` Jesus ' story having similarities to osirus and Hercules.God condoning slavery , racism , sexism , violence ... revenge in some scriptures and disaproving them in other scriptures . '' God is the author of all things . My dear chameleon , you have failed to grasp the concept . God does not condone these things . He allows us to make decisions which results in our sin . You have failed to understand what is going on in the Bible . You are so far from the truth . Sexism ? ? ? ? ! ! ! Come on , did you even read the Bible ? Women are to be submissive to their husbands , yes . But there is even greater responsibility from the husbands to the wives .

"Does the government have the right to order private internet companies to provide user 's search records ? Lately both Yahoo and Google where served a court ordered to hand over to the government some search records regarding porn Some good answers here . I 'll take a stab at it myself , though I do n't know anything about the incidents other than what the original poster included in his question.First , we 're talking about illegal pornography . `` Regular '' porn , the kind that is n't illegal depending on whoever 's standards we 're using , is n't going to be subject to a search warrant because it is n't a crime ... and search warrants can only be issued when they seek to provide evidence of a public offense ( a crime ) . So whatever porn we 're talking about , it 's evidently illegal according to whatever legal standard is being used ( and this varies , but things like kiddy porn are illegal everywhere in the US ) . Once the illegality has been established , then I do n't think there 's much left to talk about ... you can not hide behind a right to privacy if you are engaging in criminal behavior . That 's not to say you give up your right to privacy , it 's to say that if you 're engaging in criminal acts , the government has the right to ask a judge for a search warrant to gather evidence of those acts , and I would argue that you can not complain about your privacy being `` invaded '' when they do.And a word about search warrants ; they are not rubber-stamped documents that sail through the justice system to your front door . Law enforcement agents must prepare an application for them , outlining reasons to believe a particular place holds evidence of a particular crime . They must swear the things they 've said in that document are true , and then they must present the document to a neutral party - a magistrate ( or a judge ) . That magistrate ( or judge ) then reviews the information provided by the agent , and decides on his/her own if there is a more than likely chance ( i.e. , `` probable cause '' ) that the things the agents are looking for are in the places the agents say they are . Despite the rare news to the contrary , magistrates and law enforcement alike take this process seriously.About the `` third party '' argument made by the original poster : again - if you 're engaging in criminal behavior , you can not expect to hide behind the right to privacy just because you 've given the evidence of your guilt to a third party . The government has the right under our system of law to gather evidence of your criminal behavior , no matter where you have left it.If you want to deliver evidence of your involvement in criminal acts to a third party , press on ... and you do so at your own risk , obviously . The original poster 's comment is well taken ; if your third party is going to comply with an order of a court to disclose certain information relative to criminal acts , then perhaps you need to find another third party - one who will become a criminal themselves if they fail to comply with a lawful court order.Yahoo and Google have not betrayed anyone 's trust ... although it 's been a while since I 've seen them , I 'm fairly certain both corporations have privacy policies , and I 'm equally certain both of them talk about safeguarding your information except when ordered to release it pursuant to a court order . If the third party thing bothers you , do n't use a third party ... there 's a saying : `` three can keep a secret , if two are dead . '' Do n't want anybody to know what you 're doing ? Do n't tell anybody .",0

"can the government really do illegal actions ? for instence ... can the gov . really lie to the public about different things like terrist acts and catasraphies . iv heard theorise that 9/11 didnt happen by commersial airplains and by types of gov . airplanes and that the CIA kidnapes terrorists and takes them to different countries where they have no laws and torchers them and things like that ? dont worry . this information is from reliable sourses which is why i wounder about this . Of course , various individuals within the American government , as well as larger entities within the government have gotten away with crimes . Check out the story of Ruby Ridge . Sara Weaver war murdered by FBI agent Leon Horiuchi 's sniper fire , as she stood on the doorstep with baby in her arms . The FBI also murdered one of her sons and killed the family dog . The government had to pay Randy Weaver 1.5 million dollars for this fiasco , but the government murderer Leon Horiuchi could never be prosecuted . Similar events happened at the government massacre of innocent civilians at the Branch Davidian church at Waco , Texas . Attorney General Janet Reno and ultimately Bill Clinton , were responsible for those murders , but they and all under them were never prosecuted . Our founders knew that government was a beast which would always grow in power and corruption and tyranny , unless seriously counterpoised by an armed and freedom loving people . Thomas Jefferson said the tree of liberty must be watered from time to time by the blood of patriots and the blood of tyrants . Our second amendment rights and inalienable God given rights to keep and bear arms , has been continually eroded by unconstitutional antigun laws . The people have been brainwashed by the government propaganda centers ( public schools ) that the government is our saviour , and that our rights come from the government , not from God , as the Declaration of Independence so clearly stated . Check out JPFO ( Jews for the Preservation of Firearm Ownership , Aaron Zelman 's group ) , which is the strongest gun rights group . The NRA is nothing but compromising antigun hypocrites.Alex Jones and some others believe that 911 was a conspiracy by the illuminati . Hard to tell . But certainly , if passengers on board those airlines had been able to exercise their constitutional right to keep and bear arms , such a thing could n't have happened . I will not fly if I ca n't take my gun . I will not be subjected to unconstitutional searches getting on the plane like some slave dog . I am a free american . The Patriot Act and similar legislation shows that the government is far more interested in using 911 and similar incidents to attack our rights , rather than to go after the enemy .",0

The Next Generation was BY FAR the best to me.Now I 'm too old to know about the Original Series too much , and the special effects are too corny for me now adays . Anyway ... Here 's why TNG is the best.-Dynamic characters that do n't seem too forced ( you 'll see the oposite later ) -The Enterprise was not DOOMED every episode - sometimes it was just about one or two characters-Was VERY optimistic about the future-Spoke about conditions of humanity and why we 're the way we are.DS9 was my second favor , but there 's some tihngs I did n't like ... -Too political for my liking ( I hate the Bajoran and Klingon episodes ) -Much dimmer view of the future-The Difiant is all that 's given to protect the MOST IMPORTANT STATION in the galxy ? !

It increases heart rate and stroke volume , dilates the pupils , and constricts arterioles in the skin and gut while dilating arterioles in leg muscles . It elevates the blood sugar level by increasing hydrolysis of glycogen to glucose in the liver , and at the same time begins the breakdown of lipids in fat cells .",0

"Is an IRA account protected against civil judgement from a lawsuit when the account owner lives in NYC or NJ ? I am not sure how the state laws of NY or NJ address the protection of IRA assets , but the new bankruptcy law enacted last year does provide ceratin protections on a national basis . the following excerpt is from `` http : //www.retirement-retirement.com/story-486.php '' [ Especially important to participants in employer-based retirement plans is that the bankruptcy act says that all assets rolled over from these plans into an IRA , and all subsequent earnings made inside the account attributable to the rollover , are protected from creditors , regardless of the amount of the rollover . That should remove much of the reluctance among investors to move most retirement plan assets into IRAs if they decide that 's the best financial strategy . While IRAs have unlimited protection for certain rollover amounts , such is not the case for original ( non-rollover ) contributions by the owner to traditional and Roth IRAs . The bankruptcy act put a price tag on the `` reasonably necessary '' amount that might be protected in these IRAs ­ $ 1 million . That is , if the aggregated value of your original contributions and their earnings to traditional and Roth IRAs exceeds $ 1 million , the amount above $ 1 million ( excluding any protected rollover amounts ) could be vulnerable to creditors . That $ 1 million amount is indexed annually to inflation . Most investors building an IRA from scratch wo n't exceed the $ 1 million limit , since annual contribution limits to traditional and Roth IRAs have been relatively low for the past two decades . And the bankruptcy act allows bankruptcy courts to permit the IRA owner to keep more than $ 1 million if it is in the `` interest of justice '' ( though the act did not spell out what constitutes an interest in justice ) . ]",0

"Who supports these liars in the White House ? Do you remember Lawrence Lindsey ? He was one of King George ’ s II economic policy advisor 's and Director of the National Economic Council from 2001 to 2002 . He was fired in 2002 after suggesting that the Iraq War would cost upwards of $ 200 billion . The official administration propaganda at the time said the war would cost $ 60 billion . They also said we would be greeted as liberators and showered with flowers.Mr . Lindsey was wrong . Congress has already appropriated $ 357 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan . Remember , these cost are on top of the $ 400+ billion a year we already spend on defense.It gets worse . According to a new economic study by Joseph Stiglitz , a former Chief Economist of the World Bank and a Nobel Prize winner in economics , the future cost of our current war/occupation will be between $ 1 trillion to $ 2 trillion.This nation spent $ 800 billion adjusted for inflation to fight the war in Vietnam . However this isn ’ t the true cost of a war . An additional $ 1 trillion was spent on Veterans benefits and interest payments after the war.What does this mean to you and your family ? It comes out to be about $ 19,600 per U.S. Household . That would have been enough to finance the shortfall in Social Security for 150 to 300 years . NO ! ! ! This is the same evidence I have used in recent months for reasons NOT to support the Iraq War . It gets worse friend.It seems that America 's continued interest in Iraq may have sparked a civil war for the `` democratic '' powers of the Iraq country . Now , America must spend billions more in building a better Iraqi military to avert any new war . This event continues to return again and again for the US.Let 's recall:1 ) The rebellion of US military forces in Mexico during the early 20th century.2 ) The resistance of American diplomacy in the Phillipines in 1898 . ( Imperialism ) 3 ) The disaster in Vietnam during the Nixon administration.The results always ends with American taxpayers paying for the problems that a Republican administration makes and the Democratic Party 's occupancy in the White House . Somehow ( probably in 2009 ) America will once again fix the problems that are prevalent now . But , our next problem will be Venezuela as it continues to be a nuissance to our sphere of influence in the Western Hemisphere . Just call this the Neverending Story .",0

"Why does n't the Jewish religion believe in Jesus if he was a Jew ? Maybe this is all ignorance on my part . I do n't know . I really want to know . Truly and honestly , I 'm just trying to educate myself further . Any explanations are greatly appreciated . PLEASE look at the following : :http : //WhatJewsBelieve.orghttp : //Convert.org The basic beliefs of Christianity about Jesus are against what the Bible says , and so Real Jews can not believe in Jesus at all.The Christian understanding is that the Messiah , Jesus , died for the sins of the people . The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin.But we are taught in our Torah that no one can die for the sins of another . In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death forthe fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin ( eesh b ’ chet-o yumatu ) .In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself to atone for the sins of the people . To be written out of Gd 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . Gd 's response is No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : Exodus 32:30-35 And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Etrnl ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Etrnl , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Etrnl said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book . The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for Gd 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd will forgive us.So , the Bible is clear , no one can die for the sins of another , and this means that Jesus can not die for anyone else 's sins.Christians also believe that one needs a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin , that one who does not have such a blood sacrifice will die in their sins , and go to hell , except for the sacrifice of Jesus.This , too , is UnBiblical . The Bible describes blood sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin in the Book of Leviticus . But it is in Leviticus itself , in the middle of the discussion of the sin sacrifices , that we are taught that we do not need a blood sacrifice to be forgiven for our sins . Offering a blood sacrifice was an expensive thing to do for the family offering the animal . Was forgiveness then , to be only for the rich ? No , because if one could not afford a blood sacrifice then one who sins could bring flour , which has no blood and no life as their sacrifice , and Gd forgave them ! Leviticus 5:11-13 ; But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering ; he shall put no oil upon it , neither shall he put any frankincense thereon : for it is a sin offering.Furthermore , read the Book of Jonah . In Jonah , the People of Ninevah do three things in order to be forgiven by Gd . They fast , they pray for forgiveness , and they stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgave them ! This is exactly what we do on Yom Kippur , we fast , we pray for forgiveness , and , hopefully , we stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgives us . And what book do we read on Yom Kippur afternoon ? The Book of Jonah ! Jonah 3:7-10 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Ninevah , by the decree of the King and his nobles , saying , Let neither man nor beast , herd nor flock taste anything ; let them not feed nor drink water ; but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto Gd ; yea , let them turn every one from his evil",0

"If the Google people are supposed to be so smart , how come so many of their recent UIs are lame ? Google reader is pretty bad . Google desktop is clunky ( although a good idea in theory ) . Google groups is lame . Heck even their Google Answers sucks in comparison to this Yahoo Answers site.In addition , it seems to me that yahoo , ask.com and some others are innovating more on search results . For example , enter in a name of a sports team ( in season ) on different search engines and you 'll see a good example of what I mean.Do they have too many programmers/engineers and not enough true , touchy/feely UI designers ? Does Google plan to just live off their brand now ? Concerned Google stockholder . In my opinion , Google was never something more than a great search engine . In an early era where dial-up was more common than broadband , Google built a top-notch engine with a very light UI which made it an immediate favorite amongst a lot of users . What was nice about Google was that it never aspired to be something someone else was , it created its own identity as a very comprehensive search engine . However , offlate , I have started losing faith in Google , especially because their objectives and goals as a company seem very unclear . A chunk of their revenue still comes through ads , and their search engine is really the only intellectual property they have developed from the ground-up , otherwise everything else is either just an acquisition or a bad idea . Google earth was previously keynote , Google Talk has been built upon Jabber which is an open source technology for messaging and these were the `` other '' great ideas besides the search engine , but things like web accelerators and secure connection through VPN are just lame excuses to drive internet traffic through their servers.Another great idea from Google was desktop search , but somehow they never capitalized on the idea , and today MSN has come out tops in this department.At the end of the day , Google isnt running out of ideas , I think they are running out of focus , something that companies like Yahoo have and very well defined ones at that .",0

"how can end premature ejaculation ? i used to practise masturbation since I was 15 and spoilt my sexual functioning to result to premature ejaculation.Nowadays I cant enjoy sex with women because I finish the round so Easy ! I am now 23 having quit masturbation just October 2005 . The praecox ejaculation just is a PSYCHOLOGICAL problem . Besides , with that term is specified any ejaculation that occurs involuntarily during the sexual act and BEFORE the penetration can occur even . Any short time concerning the duration of the sexual act mustn ’ t confused with the premature ejaculation . In fact , medically the penetration and the ejaculation inside the vagina exclude the problem . Some drug could be taken , but ONLY with the consent of the doctor while for you problem there are some different method to use . It ’ s not the right place here to prolong and if you just has too shame to talk with the doctor I ’ ll advice you to buy some specific book.I guess that your request is connected with your partner satisfaction.In fact , the most part of women need longer times for reaching orgasm than men.You know that the average time is within 15-30 min. , but it gets no sense if our partner needs a different time . Therefore , we must compare our time ( short or long ) with our partner ’ s one ! I only can give you some advices now.Try to begin the full act ( penetration ) as late as possible using in the meanwhile other methods ( you know ) to excite your partner . While “ acting ” try to think about different stuffs , just to distract your mind . Somebody stops the act a bit before the apex , just to avoid the forthcoming ejaculation or stop frequently the penetration during the act ( continuing to excite the partner anyway ) .Then , if you are able to have two acts consecutively , the most will already be done !",0

"what is pollination ? pollination , transfer of pollen from the male reproductive organ ( stamen or staminate cone ) to the female reproductive organ ( pistil or pistillate cone ) of the same or of another flower or cone . Pollination is not to be confused with fertilization , which it may precede by some time—a full season in many conifers . The most common agents of pollination are flying insects ( as in most flowering plants ) and the wind ( as in many trees and all grasses and conifers ) , but crawling and hopping insects , snails , bats , primates , rodents , and hummingbirds may also serve . The devices that operate to ensure cross-pollination and prevent self-pollination ( see sex ) are varied and sometimes extremely intricate . Among them are different maturation times for the pollen and eggs of the same flower or plant , separate staminate and pistillate flowers on the same or on different plants , chemical properties that make the pollen and eggs of the same plant sterile to each other , and specialized mechanisms or structural arrangements that prevent the pollinating agent from transferring the pollen of a flower to its own stigma . In the lady's-slipper the bee enters the nectar-filled pouch by one opening and must leave by another ; in so doing it brushes first past the stigma , which scrapes pollen off its back , and then past the stamens , which deposit another load of pollen . The stamens of the mountain laurel are bent back and held like springs by notches in the petals ; when the bee alights it contacts the tall pistil and then , in probing deeper for nectar , triggers the stamens . Pollen is catapulted onto the insect 's underside , ready for contact with the next pistil . Other examples of floral adaptations to their pollinating agents are the fig and its wasp and the yucca and its moth . Wind pollination , depending as it does on statistical chance for successful pollination , requires vast quantities of pollen , which may be forcefully ejected by the anther sac ( as in grasses and ragweed ) or may be exposed ( as in cones and catkins ) to the slightest breeze .

"what causes hiccups ? Hiccups are gulping sounds caused by involuntary spasms of the diaphragm . The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen and helps with breathing . Hiccups can be triggered if you eat too much or too fast , consume very hot or cold foods and beverages , or drink carbonated beverages . Other causes include cold showers , entering or leaving a hot or cold room , sudden excitement , and stress . Hiccups are not a serious medical condition and usually disappear on their own within a few minutes . If they last longer than 24 hours , hiccups may be a sign of another condition or injury . You should see your health care provider if you experience prolonged hiccuping . Home remedies are usually the primary treatment for hiccups , although no one is really sure how well they work . Hiccup home remedies include sneezing , being suddenly frightened , holding your breath , gargling , drinking pineapple juice , drinking water rapidly , sipping ice water , or swallowing dry granulated sugar . These activities may help by altering breathing patterns .",0

"What is the best treatment for canker sores ? Any way to promote healing or maybe reduce the pain ? Canker sores usually go away without any treatment . For pain relief , you can try taking ibuprofen ( brand name : Advil ) or acetaminophen ( brand name : Tylenol ) . Other medicines , such as Anbesol , Oragel , Orabase and Zilactin-B , might keep your canker sores from becoming irritated by eating , drinking or brushing your teeth . You put these medicines right on the sore.You can also mix equal amounts of Milk of Magnesia and Benadryl Allergy liquid . After it 's mixed , you can swish a teaspoonful in your mouth for about 1 minute and then spit it out . If you do this every 4 to 6 hours , your canker sores may hurt less.Some people think that sucking on zinc lozenges , taking vitamin C or vitamin B complex , using a sage-and-chamomile mouthwash or taking a lysine supplement helps their canker sores heal faster .",0

"16 year difference in age - college teacher/ former student . How long before it ends ? I am curious as to other 's ideas . My ex-husband , a professional ethics prof , left me for one of his former students . She was then 20 , he 36 . We 's been married 13 years , together 15+ and it was very sudden . She knew he was married , and she was in lesbian relationship living with lover ; never been with man . Huge power differential , and she is still a student so he pays for all her living expenses in the apartment they share . She went from her female lovers place , where she dropped the bomb , to my ex 's new apartment in one day.Part of me feels that it was a mid-life crisis , but he invested so much he ca n't ever tell me so or apologize to me.Thoughts ? Know of similar prof/student relationships that worked long haul ? ? ? She could have been just struggling financially and looking for a sugar daddy . Or she might be serious about him , who knows . But even then they will be together for a while , but let 's say in ten years she will still be young and he ... not so much . She 'll end up leaving him for a younger guy too , which will serve him right . Ethics professor my a** !

"Pope Benedict 's stance on the Charasmatic Renewal ? What is Pope Benedicts stance on the Charasmatic Renewal of the Catholic Church . I recieved the Holy Ghost , with tongues , in Catholicism.I was under the impression then that Pope John Paul II had a favorable attitude towards it , but what about the current Pope Benedics ? I think that Pope Benedict is in support of this movement in general , though he , like others in the Catholic hierarchy , has some concerns about it . He seems to support the movement , but reminds members to stay connected to the whole Church . The quotation below is from before he was elected Pope . For his part , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , has added his voice to the Pope 's in acknowledging the good occurring in the Charismatic Renewal and providing some cautions . In a forward to a book by Cardinal Suenens , at that time the Pope 's delegate to the Charismatic Renewal , the Prefect comments on the Post-Conciliar period stating , '' At the heart of a world imbued with a rationalistic skepticism , a new experience of the Holy Spirit suddenly burst forth . And , since then , that experience has assumed a breadth of a worldwide Renewal movement . What the New Testament tells us about the charisms - which were seen as visible signs of the coming of the Spirit - is not just ancient history , over and done with , for it is once again becoming extremely topical . `` Speaking of the book 's subject , renewal and the powers of darkness , he says , '' What is the relation between personal experience and the common faith of the Church ? Both factors are important : a dogmatic faith unsupported by personal experience remains empty ; mere personal experience unrelated to the faith of the Church remains blind . `` Finally , he urges those who read the book to pay special attention to the author 's double plea , '' ... to those responsible for the ecclesiastical ministry - from parish priests to bishops - not to let the Renewal pass them by but to welcome it fully ; and on the other ( hand ) ... to the members of the Renewal to cherish and maintain their link with the whole Church and with the charisms of their pastors . `` [ Renewal and the Powers of Darkness , Leo Cardinal Suenens ( Ann Arbor : Servant Books , 1983 ) ]",0

Even if you remember those , you still need to know the sharps and flats of different keys . Again , your best bet is to get a piano book and/or find a piano teacher .",0

"How do you rate a movie/play ? I 'm very curious about this . My Grandma died four years ago , and just before she died , she took my cousin and I to see Phantom of the Opera . It was her favorite musical . It was the last musical she ever took us to.I told my cousin that now my second favorite musical is Rent , and that my first is Wicked . She asked if there were any other plays that I had cried at . I said I almost cried at Phantom , but it is n't one of my favorite musicals ... I 've never truly been able to love the music . I like it ... but not in the same way I do Wicked or Rent.She got mad , and we fought , but it got me to thinking ... how many people judge a movie or a play based on who they were with/the time the had during it . And how many people can set that aside and judge based solely on the movie or play itself . So , which way do you do it ? I base movies/musicals based solely on my enjoyment of them . It has to be entertaining and a good story , otherwise its not gon na be a favorite . As an aside - I definitely agree about Wicked - I LOVE it ( both because I enjoyed the story and that I saw it for the first time with my best friend . )",0
"how can i manually change an IRQ address for a pci card in WIN XP - it has to be possible ! ! ? i must address an add on PCI Paralell Port to IRQ 7 and DMA 3 in ECP Mode or this software that I have for my printer wont work . It has to be possible ! It was with win 98 , why not now d**mit ! ! Ah , the wonders of Plug and Play . I would not rely on being able to force XP to a specific IRQ - you never can be 100 % sure how PnP will act . However , I 've listed a couple suggestions . If you have already tried the following , I apologize in advance.In the Device Manager , select the printer port , and open it 's properties . Go to the Resources tab , and uncheck the `` Use autmatic settings '' checkbox . Change the `` Settings based on '' drop-down to `` Basic configuration n '' . Highlight the Interrupt Request option in the `` Resource settings '' list and click the Change button . Dial-in the IRQ you prefer . If the DMA option is provided as well , set it to 3 using the same process above.Otherwise , you may be able to force the IRQ and DMA in your system BIOS . If your BIOS has a Plug and Play configuration section , you can sometimes `` reserve '' specific IRQ 's and DMA 's for certain PCI slots . Please refer to your manufacturer 's specifications for details as there are several different BIOS options and I am not familiar with all of them .",0

Once you determine the feasibility of how long it will take to get yourself set up properly with the city - as well as if you will need to open in an area other than the one you might have wished to - then it is just a matter of getting the business side of things in order , locating & securing a building , furnishing it & hiring dancers.Good luck !",0

"why do some people get addicted to drugs and some do n't ? Addiction to drugs and alcohol tends to run in families and may have to do with how the brain processes certain chemicals , particularly those of the `` feel good '' type , which may be lacking or dormant in the addict until they are activated by drugs or alcohol . According to Carl Jung , alcoholic drinking is seen as a reflection of the human need , gone wrong , for a spiritual life . In a famous letter to Bill Wilson , Jung wrote that the craving for alcohol is the equivalent , on a low level , of the spiritual thirst of our being for wholeness , or union with God . Jungnotes that in the word alcohol in Latin is spiritus , a word that describes the highest religious experience , as well as the most depraving poison . In solving the problem of alcoholism , Jung offered the formula spiritus contra spiritum . A figurative translation of this Latin formular is , `` it takes the Spirit of God to overcome the harmful spirit of alcohol . ”",0

"can antigravity be achieved ? Anti-gravity in the context of mainstream physicsNewton 's Law of Gravitation considered gravity to be a force between two objects , causing attraction in proportion to the objects ' mass . Under this interpretation , an object with negative mass would repel ordinary matter , and could be used to produce an anti-gravity effect . Alternatively , depending on the mechanism assumed to underlie the gravitational force , it may seem reasonable to postulate a material that shields against gravity or otherwise interferes with the force . An example of such a material , cavorite , is a major deus ex machina of H. G. Wells ' famous book , The First Men in the Moon , though it should be noted that Cavorite is n't consistent with even a Newtonian view of the universe ( it causes violations of conservation laws ) . Neither negative-mass exotic matter nor a gravity-screening material have been observed experimentally . While the potential existence of exotic matter is still debated , general relativity presents persuasive arguments against the existence of screening materials . Einstein 's theory of general relativity , published in 1915 , supplanted Newton 's model of gravity with an entirely different mechanism - one based entirely on the geometry of the universe . Gravity was no longer a force at all , but simply the consequence of the local slope of the universe in a direction the human eye can not see : time . You stick to the floor not because gravity is pulling you down , but because that is the shortest distance between today and tomorrow . Under this model , gravity in a universe containing only matter with positive mass is purely attractive . No arrangement of ordinary matter can produce an anti-gravity effect . Spacetime geometries corresponding to true anti-gravity in general relativity require negative mass . Some models of anti-gravity claim to derive from general relativity.The model of gravity proposed by the theory of general relativity breaks down under extreme conditions ( too far inside a black hole , and in the very early life of the universe under the big bang model ) . In particular , most physicists believe that at extremely high energies , gravity and the other fundamental forces unify , which would allow gravity to be manipulated in ways that are not readily apparent now . Candidate models for this regime are theories of everything , which attempt to model all four forces ( example : string theory ) , and theories of quantum gravity , which attempt to produce a model of gravity that is consistent with quantum mechanics , though not necessarily unified with the other forces . Some models of anti-gravity claim to be based on quantum gravity models , though the connection of these to mainstream quantum gravity models is often tenuous.Conventional effects that look like anti-gravityMagnetic levitation suspends an object against gravity by use of electromagnetic effects . While visually impressive , this is not an anti-gravity effect . Critics of various alleged anti-gravity devices often suggest that unusual effects observed around them are due to electromagnetism.A tidal force causes objects to move along diverging paths near a massive body ( such as a planet or star ) , producing effects that seem like repulsion or disruptive forces when observed locally . This is not anti-gravity . In Newtonian mechanics , the tidal force is the effect of the larger object 's gravitational force being different at the differing locations of the diverging bodies . In Einsteinian gravity , the tidal force is the effect of the diverging bodies following different paths in the negatively curved spacetime around the larger body . Large amounts of normal matter can be used to produce a gravitational field that compensates for the effects of another gravitational field , though the entire assembly will still be attracted to the source of the larger field . Physicist Robert L. Forward proposed using lumps of degenerate matter to locally compensate for th",0

"i need info on thighroid cancer . My sister has this cancer and is getting the runaround from the doctor ? Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer . Thyroid cancer is a cancerous tumor or growth located within the thyroid gland . Thyroid cancer is one of the few cancers that has increased in incidence rates over the past several years . Its incidence has increased by about 3 % per 100,000 people per year . The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 25,690 new cases of thyroid cancer in the U.S. in 2005 . Of these new cases , about 19,190 will occur in women and about 6,500 will occur in men . About 1,490 people ( 860 women and 630 men ) will die of thyroid cancer in 2005 . Many patients , especially in the early stages of thyroid cancer , do not experience symptoms . However , as the cancer develops , symptoms can include a lump or nodule in the front of the neck , hoarseness or difficulty speaking , swollen lymph nodes , difficulty swallowing or breathing , and pain in the throat or neck . There are several types of thyroid cancer : papillary , follicular , medullary , anaplastic , and variants . Papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas are referred to as well-differentiated thyroid cancer and account for 80–90 % of all thyroid cancers . Variants include tall cell , insular , columnar , and Hurthle cell . Their treatment and management are similar . If detected early , most papillary and follicular thyroid cancer can be treated successfully.Medullary thyroid carcinoma ( MTC ) accounts for 5-10 % of all thyroid cancers.Medullary cancer is easier to treat and control if found before it spreads to other parts of the body . There are two types of medullary thyroid cancer : sporadic and familial . Genetic testing ( of the RET proto-oncogene should be performed in all patients with MTC to determine whether there are genetic changes that predict the development of MTC . In individuals with these genetic changes , removal of the thyroid during childhood has a high probability of being curative.Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is the least common and accounts for only 1–2 % of all thyroid cancer . This type is difficult to control and treat because it is a very aggressive type of thyroid cancer.Treatments for thyroid cancer include surgery , radioactive iodine treatment , external beam radiation therapy , and chemotherapy . In most cases , patients undergo surgery to remove most of the thyroid gland , and are treated with thyroid hormone replacement therapy . For those with papillary and follicular thyroid cancer , the dose of thyroid hormone replacement is usually high enough to suppress thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) well below the range that is normal for someone not diagnosed with thyroid cancer , to help prevent the growth of cancer cells while providing essential thyroid hormone to the body . Factors associated with thyroid cancer include a family history of thyroid cancer , gender ( women have a higher incidence of thyroid cancer ) , age ( the majority of cases occur in people over 40 , although thyroid cancer affects all age groups from children through seniors ) , and prior exposure of the thyroid gland to radiation . While the prognosis for most thyroid cancer patients is very good , the rate of recurrence can be up to 30 % , and recurrences can occur even decades after the initial diagnosis . Therefore , it is important that patients get regular follow-up examinations to detect whether the cancer has re-emerged . Monitoring should continue throughout the patient ’ s lifetime . Periodic follow-up examinations can include a review of the medical history together with selected blood tests appropriate for the type of cancer and stage of treatment ( TSH , thyroglobulin , CEA , and calcitonin levels ) , physical examination , and imaging techniques ( ultrasound , radioiodine whole body scan , chest X-ray , CT , MRI , PET , and other tests ) .",0

"how are the moon and the sun visible at the same time ? Draw a big circle to represent the sun.Draw a medium circle to represent the earth.Now , between the two circles , draw a tiny circle to represent the moon.The moon casts a shadow on the earth . Imagine that you are in the shadow . What you are seeing is an eclipse . You only see the moon.Wait a couple minutes and the moon will move away from the sun . Now you can see both the sun and the moon.The moon can continue moving away from the sun for a long time and you will still be able to see it.Usually , you can see the sun and moon at the same time because , most of the time , they are not on opposite sides of the earth . An exception is when there is a full moon , or nearly full moon . In that case , the sun and moon are on opposite sides of the earth and you can only see one at a time .",0

"What is Socialism ? The following is an excerpt of an essay written by Albert Einstein . This essay was originally published in the first issue of Monthly Review ( May 1949 ) . `` This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism . Our whole educational system suffers from this evil . An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student , who is trained to worship acquisitive success as a preparation for his future career.I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils , namely through the establishment of a socialist economy , accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals . In such an economy , the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion . A planned economy , which adjusts production to the needs of the community , would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man , woman , and child . The education of the individual , in addition to promoting his own innate abilities , would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.Nevertheless , it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is not yet socialism . A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual . The achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems : how is it possible , in view of the far-reaching centralization of political and economic power , to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and overweening ? `` Short Answer ...

"what is the function of stipules ? wha is the importance of stipules ? There are a number of interesting functions demonstrated for stipules of certain plant species.Also protection of emerging leaves . 1 . Stipules that are green may be leaf-like ( Examples : flowering quince , a geranium , and a sycamore ) , linear , thread-like , or reduced to minute scales , thereby requiring a hand lens to see . Plant biologists have assumed that green stipules are photosynthetic , but ecophysiologists generally have not determined how significant green stipules may be as temporary or persistent photosynthetic structures . Anatomical reports on photosynthetic stipules are exceedingly rare , so that we know little about the presence of stomates and the nature of the mesophyll in stipules . 2 . If hardened with lignin , a stipule may become modified as a spine , i.e. , a stipular spine . In many species , one stipular spine or a pair of stipular spines may be observed at each node , e.g. , among legumes , and for legumes , the stipular spine is the typical type of shoot armature ( Examples : coral tree , Chloroleucon , and a mimosa ) . Obviously , stipular spines were effective in their specific native habitat for many of these cases as an adaptation to reduce predation by vertebrate herbivores . Very large , hollow stipular spines in certain species of bull acacia ( Acacia , Family Mimosaceae ) serve as homes for ants , which defend the plant from all other herbivores . Stipular spines are extremely important forms of shoot armature for the succulent euphorbs ( Family Euphorbiaceae ; examples : crown-of-thorns , young stipular spines , and old stipular spines ) , most species of which occur in thorny scrub and woodland as well as desert habitats in Africa and southern Asia . Stipular spines also are present on certain climbers . 3 . In many groups of plants , stipules are short-lived , nonphotosynthetic structures that abscise before the leaf is fully expanded ( a legume ) . Such stipules tend to be nongreen , often hyaline ( an elm ) , off-white ( ramie ) , yellow , or brownish , but there are some remarkable cases where the stipule is brilliantly colored , especially with anthocyanins , red to purple vacuolar pigments ( Talauma hodgsonii ) . A nongreen stipule probably can be regarded as vestigial , lacking any function for the mature leaf and shoot but perhaps protecting the young leaf while it is at the growing tip . 4 . Sometimes stipules and stipels have evolved as extrafloral nectaries , utilized to nourish mutualistic ants , or other types of glands . 5 . In Smilax , a lianaceous monocotyledon , the stipule may develop as a tendril . 6 . For whatever function , corky stipules are known from certain dryland shrubs , for example , the species of creosote bush ( Larrea young stipules of L. tridentata and older stipules in L. nitida ) in New World deserts and the tough-leaved evergreen species of Ceanothus in California chaparral .",0

"If I use a mixture of a ten per cent of alcohol and a ninety per gasoline , does the octane increase its level ? Short answer : yes.Octane levels are based on what is called a `` knock resistance . '' When an engine burns gas , the smaller the gas molecules , the quicker it will burn . If it burns too quickly , the energy will be released faster than the piston can use the energy . The excess energy makes the piston rattle in the chamber , `` knocking '' back and forth -- if you 've ever heard a sound like rattling marbles in the engine of an old car climbing a hill , you know what I mean here.Octane is a hydrocarbon with eight carbon atoms ( hence the `` oct '' prefix ) . But gasoline that you get at the pump is not pure octane -- it contains some lighter stuff ( like hexane and septane ) and some heavier stuff ( like novane and decane ) . Plus , there are aspects of whether the molecules in the gas are in straight chains or in branched chains . But when a consumer buys gasoline , they need some sense of what they 're getting to make sure that they 're not getting crap that will burn too quickly and mess up their engine . So instead of trying to make all gas pure octane ( which would be ridiculously expensive and wasteful ) , or trying to give a consumer a detailed assay of the types of hydrocarbons in the gas ( which would be meaningless for the consumer and likewise expensive ) , they formulate the gas into certain knock ratios . The speed of burning is measured against 2,2,4-trimethylpentane ( a type of octane ) and n-pentane . So 87 octane gas knocks as much as a mixture of 13 % pentane and 87 % octane , etc . They compare the knocking effect.Ethanol helps to slow down the burning of the gas , and does work as an actane booster . The follwing link says that 10 % ethanol added to 92 octane will give an octane rating of 94.7 , but warns that ethanol is mildly corrosive to some engine parts .",0

Time-zones are largely a convention , and given the use of UTC time ( Universal Coordinated Time / Greenwich Mean Time ) , time-zones are not entirely necessary . They are predominantly kept because of familiarity and historical convention . That said , in China it is easier for the nation to function administratively with only one time-zone , so they have chosen that . In the United States , the government chose to have time-zones for the people over administrative reasons ... although some regions of the country ( such as parts of Indiana and Arizona ) have selected rules that do not follow the national norm ( i.e . they do n't use Daylight Savings Time ) .",0
"Are American Indians really sovereign , and should they be Americans ? If you call occupation of territory settled by people and taking their land while denying them their rights or even treating them as humans civilized I guess the US must be the most barbarious civilization there is . People have been condemning the Nazis for trying to wipe out the Jews , well the Americans have suceeded even more by almost wiping out an entire nation of cultured people who were long settled in the continent with their own culture , law and government . So yes technically American Indians or more precisely the various tribes are the first people here and thus should be sovereign and even ruling the white man not vice versa as it is . They have more right to be called Americans than the rat tag bunch of colonials that arrived here and started a wave of slaughter and massacres such as the force eviction of tribes along the trail of tears , force evacuation and settlement of reservations , gifts of smallpox infested blankets in an effort in biological warfare , broken treaties and senseless wars and killings .

"Why are people considered racist if they do n't want illegal Mexicans in america even if they are ok withlegals People are often dubbed Racist if they support tougher immigration laws.If someone is angry at illegal Mexicans but ok with legal ones the are not racist.Lets face facts people at least 70 % of illegal immigration comes from Mexico.Those who propose tougher border laws are not big bad bigots , they are patriots wishing to protect this country and its economy and security . What exactly is `` handed off '' to illegal immigrants ? The general assumption that illegal immigrants are here to take what 's rightfully yours is as racist as it is ignorant.Immigrants ( legal or not ) come here looking for better opportunities and quality of life.Illegal immigrants are faced with hardships you could n't understand unless you became one . They are forced to work two and three different jobs making less than minimum wage and are taken advantage of because of their legal status.What 's ironic is that they pay taxes just like you and me.So ... they work harder for less money and on top of that pay taxes that pay the salaries of those politicians so thirsty to kick them out of the country.Going back to the original question ; those that do n't want illegal mexicans in this country are not racists . They just find it hypocritical that a group of people braking the law ( a federal one at that ) are protected by some politicians just to gain popular acceptance.To those of you that share the asker 's opinion that illegal immigrants are a threat to `` this country and its economy and security '' , I ask - how has illegal immigration affected you directly ? Did anybody get your dream job because they would do it for less money ? Did anybody get the low rent apartment you wanted ? ****** stoop_fer_lyfe ******I DO KNOW what I 'm talking about . I also live in a community riddled with illegal immigrants and am very close to many of them.What you fail to understand is that they buy new cars , buy houses or apartments and have credit cards - all things that need a credit report . Banks have changed credit requirements to accommodate them because financial institutions are not immigration officers , they are in business to make money and are not braking any law by lending money to someone that can provide Income Tax Returns . It may also be hard for you to believe that the government - regardless of the red flags it raises - accepts those Tax Returns and turns a blind eye to the migration legality of the issuer ; again , the IRS is not responsible for policing immigration laws.Maybe you have never filed a tax return , but you do n't need an employer to report and pay taxes for you . You are then 'Self-Employed ' , and you do n't necessarily need to report all your income since it ca n't be proved.Illegal immigrants know they can live very 'normal ' lives as long as they do n't break any laws other than immigration laws.It seems to me you are the one that DOES NOT KNOW what you are talking about and are merely commenting on what is fed to you by alarmist media . **************I actually enjoy these friendly exchanges.I realized why we are talking about two different illegal immigrants . You are talking about those that cross over illegally ( sneak in the country ) and I 'm talking about those that came here on a visa ( any kind ) and overstayed.The Social Security Administration used to provide SSN cards/numbers to people on temporary visas ; they were stamped with a big 'Not for employment use ' . I do n't have to tell you how easy those cards were to duplicate . I even saw a used car salesman photocopy one , remove those words and photocopy again until he ended with a 'clean ' copy before submitting the loan.On the subject of taxes ... during my college years I worked as a computer consultant , doing odd jobs that payed under $ 550 at a time , that way my 'employer ' did not have to submit a 1099 for professional services .

"How is bond length affected by the mass of a nucleus ? The proton and neutron have nearly the same mass . The electron is about 2000 times lighter . If the mass of the proton and neutron is made two times larger , so that it is 4,000 times greater than the mass of the electron , how will the bond length be affected ? Will it increase , decrease , or stay the same . Interesting scenario first of all i would like to comment . Well actually the bond is due to electronic forces . Hence mass has litle effect on the bond strength . Thus i thikn the effect of mass change should be a small one ! ! unless you change the charge of proton too ! !",0

But the way the body works , the way the rain stores up in clouds and downloads torrential waters on the earth , just think logically , how does all that rain stay up there if not from some amazing design by someone that is clearly way superior .

"Is a war with China inevitable ? Please , be specific . I do n't think the US is going to ask for war against China . That 's just stupid . But I think it is very likely that China will force us into War against our will . The teetering balance with Taiwan is just the tip of the iceberg . China has it 's eyes on the entire region -- the entire world for that matter.I think we 're safe for at least a few more years ... maybe even as many as 10 . China has n't finished feeding off of the US yet . They 'll wait until they have more money , more military technology , and they will wait until their generation of all men grows to a good military fighting age . There is a space of more than 10 years where the boys outnumber the girls 13 to 1 . This generation will be more enthused about risking their lives to take over territory that actually has females . It must be understood that this is n't `` inevitable '' just because China has the manpower . It is thought that it will happen because China pretty much says that it is going to happen . China , though it just loves to cater to the US 's cheep labor force needs , is openly anti-American . The students learn about the US as an evil empire . So is it truly `` inevitable '' ? I think the relationship between the US and China could change -- I think we could possibly become friends . But it is much more likely that in the future China will show aggression to the US or the US 's interest that will lead us into war .",0

"My husband always hot tempered ? Think about these questions and their answers : Are you both in financial trouble ? Stress from finances can make anyone hot tempered and cause strain on marriages . Work out a budget to get back on track , cut back on spending on unneeded items . Is he having trouble at work ? Encourage him to talk about it if so , to get it off of his chest . Does he have any hobbies , things he likes to do ? If so , encourage him to do them to help relax . Does he workout ? I know for me , going and doing a good workout or hitting the punching bag for a while will get rid of those feelings when I am angry.Is he insecure about something ? Does he think he is too short , too fat , too thin , etc ... ? Maybe he is hot-tempered because of this . Try to encourage him and point out his good traits . Do you take care of him at home ( sexually ) ? This caused a lot of problems in my marriage when we would n't have sex or cuddle for months at a time . Husbands are much happier when they are satisfied sexually . If none of these items apply or can help , he may just have psychological problems and should be encouraged to see a therapist or do marriage counseling to talk it out in a safe , neutral environment .

Any help on this is appreciated . Thanks . Well , it depends on the router and how your IP address is assigned but it sounds like to me you are going to have to go into your routers configuration and either tell it to detect the DHCP settings and your IP address automatically or you will have to specify it manually . My experience in this matter ( I have set up four DSL and two cable installations ) is that it should be assigned automatically if the router is n't detecting those ( i.e . the process of detecting it fails ) then the router is probably defective , I had that happen to a Netgear router , it would n't detect either one , I exchanged it for another one and the new one worked perfectly .

Leme tell u that along with urself , he is equally responsible for this . He probably did something that got u mad and u wanted to hurt him so u broke off in the heat of the moment . But now that u'v cooled off , think over it again and ask urself if it was really worth it.I mean there is something that u should know - No one is perfect ... .U have got to understand that things will not always be sugary between u and any other guy for that matter . What will count in the end is how the two of u let things unfurl . Dont let anything screw ur relationship if u really love ur partner . Communication is the key word here.So quit waiting for any more answers here , gather urself and go talk to him . If he really loves u too , Im sure he 'll be equally devastated rite now and will welcome u back.Best of luck .",0

"What is the best way to get rid of a foreign accent ? Any free ESL web site ? I am an avid theatre arts performer , and while taking performance classes there were quite a few individuals with accents . One in particular was a girl from russia , while in the class I seen her accent decrease dramatically . The reason the class helped her is because before we start our lessons we would do tongue twisters , while keeping our diction ( which means that you have to speak as clearly as possible without dropping off the end of any words or smushing the words together ) . Try some of these tongue twisters : The blue black bug bit the big brown bear , and the big brown bear bled blood.You know New York you need New York , you know you need unique New York.Red leather yellow leather , blue black metal copper kettleChrysanthimum Geranium Alluminum Linoleum-x3Say them as clearly as possible , and find new ones regularly . If you start to say them with ease then it will no longer help you to lose the accent . I also have a friend that was born in England , and theatre classes have helped him a great deal as well also because of the tongue twisters . He also said that he would read the dictionary out loud . I hope I could help ! Thanks for the 2 points !",0

"Will unfounded domestic violence charge hold up in court in Va ? My husband and I were arguing in our apartment and the neighbors called the police . We were alreay in the process of `` making up '' . The police came and interviewed him and visualy saw marks on me from the `` making up '' . The police arrested him for domestic violence and said that the state of Virginia would charge him for it not the city . They never took a statement from me nor pictures . From the time my husband got arrested to his release back to me took 45 min . He litterly walked in the back door did some paperwork and walked out the front.What are the odds that he will be found guilty with only the testamony of the officer and me testifying and telling my story in defense of my husband in the state of Va. You know , I suspect you 're not going to get many takers on this one . You 've got a lot of issues here that are very involved and nobody who knows what they are talking about is going to be able to give you an answer based on the `` facts '' you 've presented here.Rather than try to answer your question , let me ask you some more : What do you define as arguing ? Was it strictly verbal or was there any physical touching whatsoever ? Were any threats of any kind made during the argument ? You said the police saw marks on you from `` making up '' ... which , frankly , is very suspicious to an old cop like me . But the question is , what kind of marks ? Are you talking about a hickey or a bruise ? When the police interviewed your husband , what did he say ? Did he perhaps admit to doing something that would have violated the law in your state ? And please - if you did not personally hear the interview between your husband and the police , you do not *know* what was said ... you might know what your husband told you later , but if you did n't hear it for yourself , you do n't know.Do n't know if you 're asking a question about the city or the state prosecuting , but if you are : not unusual for the state to prosecute a domestic violence charge , even if the victim denies it or changes their story later.If you told the police the marks on you were from `` making up '' , then they did take a statement from you . Once you said that , the police may have felt that was all the statement they were going to get out of you - especially if the marks they saw were not consistent with what you said was `` making up '' ( for example : most people do n't make up by leaving bruises , swollen lips , scratches , black eyes , etc ... if those are the marks you 're talking about , I 'm with the cops on this one ) .If you had marks , the police certainly should have taken photos of them . Some types of minor injuries do n't show well in photos ( especially depending on the equipment ) so they may not have thought photos were worthwhile or they just simply did n't take them . What were your `` marks '' ? You 're asking what the odds are that he 'll be found guilty based on what you say is the officer 's testimony and your statement in defense of your husband . Ca n't answer that one because neither you nor I have all the facts , I suspect.What did the neighbors say ( or more importantly , do the neighbors have something to say ; did they hear threats , did they hear physical violence , did they hear you say something that would suggest you were being victimized ) ? What did he say ? Maybe without meaning to , he admitted to a crime . He would n't be the first person to do so ... and if the cops were skillful interviewers , they may have obtained an admission or confession from him without him realizing he was doing so.What is the crime of domestic violence in Virginia ? You were smart to include that you 're in that state because it certainly makes a difference ( and unfortunately , I 'm not from there ) .Do the police know you and your husband ? Either of you been arrested for domestic violence before ? Bottom line : way too many `` what-if 's '' for anyone to give you an educated answer to your question . Depending on the answers to the questions I 've asked , the chances of him being found guilty could be very good , or very poor.And finally : I 've investigated domestic violence crimes for over 18 years as a police officer . I hope everything you wrote here is absolutely true ... that you were not the victim of domestic violence , and that you are as safe today as the day you were born . I hope nobody ever lays a hand on you , threatens you , or abuses you . However , what you 've written here ( and what I suspect your answers to some of my questions might be ) is some of the most commonly-expressed statements I 've heard from domestic violence vi",0

"why is glucose highly reactive in oxygen gas ( at 37 degree celcius ) in the biological systems ? the same mixture of glucose and oxygen gas is stable outside the biological system . does the compex order of the biological system one of the reasons ? Biological systems have enzymes ( and a handful of other reagents ) which will use O2 and sugar to make energy -- specifically , hexokinase ( HK ) , phosphoglucose isomerase ( PGI ) , phosphofructokinase ( PFK ) , aldolase , triose phosphate isomerase ( TIM ) , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) , phosphoglycerate kinase ( PGK ) , phosphoglycerate mutase ( PGM ) , endolase , and pyruvate kinase ( PK ) . The process undergone is called glycolysis . The result is that glucose is consumed , making two pyruvate molecules ( which in some systems can then enter the Citric Acid Cycle aka Kreb 's Cycle ) and ADP is turned into ATP , which is an energy source.And after memorizing this and subsequently forgeting all this useless detail some years ago , I nearly ralphed on my book reading this just now .

"Do Photons have any mass ? ( explain ) ? if yes , so why the Photon 's mass does n't increase while moving in the speed of light.and if no , so why a Photon hits an electron , the electron starts moving and the lights frequence increases ? ? ? It is not possible to experimentally measure something to have a value of exactly zero . The current limit on the mass of the photon is < 10^25 times lighter than the proton.The idea of a particle 's mass changing with velocity has not been used by serious physicists for several decades . We now rewrite the momentum equation asmomentum = gamma*mass*velocity , where the factor gamma describes the effect previously known as `` relativistic mass '' .The energy of a particle is energy = gamma * mass * c^2 ( try setting gamma=1 for a stationary particle ) so we can write momentum = energy * velocity / c^2or momentum = energy/c for particles moving at the speed of light.So , even though a photon has zero ( or very small ) mass , it still has momentum , which it can transfer to an electron .",0

The person who brings it to light is called the relator , who with the help of an attorney files a lawsuit that is not public information ( under seal ) .

"Where do Muslims and Buddists stand on abortion ? bismillahir rahmanir raheem . I will answer this to the best of my ability and knowledge and Allah knows best . First of all , pre Islamic Arabs did not kill ALL of the girl infants otherwise there would have been no more Arabs . But female infanticide did exist and was generally an economic concern more than anything , and had nothing to do with `` bad omens '' , it says in the Quran `` Kill not your children for fear of want '' . Prophet Muhammad ( SAW ) put an end to that practice of female infanticide . But to answer your question , there is no concensus today amongst learned people , male and female but the predominant opinion is that Abortion is not allowed unless a physician says it is necessary to save the life of the mother . This is because our lives and bodies are not our own . They are gifts to us from our creator and only our creator has the right to take them away . But while we have them they are in our care and we are responsible for that . For instance , smoking has been shown to be harmful and the concensus opinion is that it is not allowed because of that . Taking a human life is the ultimate action in this way and it includes the taking of the human life that is growing in the mother 's womb . Children also are considered to be a gift from Allah ( SWT ) and we are not allowed to kill them before or after they leave the mother 's womb . A second , minority opinion , says that since the soul does not enter the body until 40 days after conception therefore abortion is legal for the first 40 days . This opinion is an extreme minority.Salim",0

"Why is the color in a 50 year old movie so much better than in a new movie ? `` better '' is a very subjective term . Technicolor process films allowed for super-saturated colors to be seen in the final print . Currently there is n't any process similar to that in wide use . Technicolor used three strips of black and white film , each exposed through a filter ( red , green , blue ) to capture the original images . Then in a lab , each of the black and white strips were exposed against color film print stock with the same color filter . This process also led to occasional color mis-registration in some films where the lab work was rushed or done sloppily.Most modern films are shot on single-strips of negative with three dye layers of emulsion that are each sensitive to different color wavelengths . ( see the first link below ) A very popular film stock these days is Kodak 's 5279 `` vision 500T '' which has a very high ISO yet does n't get as grainy as previous high ISO films . ( see second link below ) Because films nowadays are shot on single-strip film , super-saturating colors requires post-processing for color-timing , such as digital intermediate processing ( see link 3 below for Discreet 's DI product info . ) Directors also like to have a lot of creative control over the look and feel of a film that is done through the color timing process ( see the 4th link , although the entry is incorrect as Pleasantville was the first film to be completely digitally color-graded in 1998 ) This can include adding hues or increasing or reducing contrast - good examples are in Cinderella Man and Lord of the Rings : ROTK",0

"Is drinking coffee bad for you ? Here are some of the benefits and risk of drinking coffee.BenefitsCoffee increases the effectiveness of pain killers—especially migraine medications—and can rid some people of asthma . Some of the beneficial effects may be restricted to one sex , for instance it has been shown to reduce the occurrence of gallstones and gallbladder disease in men . Coffee intake may reduce one 's risk of diabetes mellitus type 2 by up to half . While this was originally noticed in patients who consumed high amounts ( 7 cups a day ) , the relationship was later shown to be linear ( Salazar-Martinez 2004 ) .Coffee can also reduce the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver and prevent colon and bladder cancers . Coffee can reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma , a variety of liver cancer ( Inoue , 2005 ) . Also , coffee reduces the incidence of heart disease , though whether this is simply because it rids the blood of excess fat or because of its stimulant effect is unknown . At the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Washington , D.C. , on August 28 , 2005 , chemist Joe Vinson of the University of Scranton presented his analysis showing that for Americans , who as a whole do not consume large quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables , coffee represents by far the largest source of valuable antioxidants in the diet . [ 4 ] Coffee contains the anticancer compound methylpyridinium . This compound is not present in significant amounts in other food materials . Methylpyridinium is not present in raw coffee beans but is formed during the roasting process from trigonellin , which is common in raw coffee beans . It is present in both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee , and even in instant coffee . 6Coffee is also a powerful stimulant for peristalsis and is sometimes considered to prevent constipation ; it is also a diuretic.Many people drink coffee for its ability to increase short term recall and increase IQ . It also changes the metabolism of a person so that their body burns a higher proportion of lipids to carbohydrates , which can help athletes avoid muscle fatigue.Some of these health effects are realized by as little as 4 cups a day ( 24 U.S. fl oz , 700 mL ) , but others occur at 5 or more cups a day ( 32 U.S. fl oz or 0.95 L or more ) .Some controversy over these effects exists , since by its nature coffee consumption is associated with other behavioral variables . Therefore it has been variously suggested that the cognitive effects of caffeine are limited to those who have not developed a tolerance , or to those who have developed a tolerance and are caffeine-deprived.Practitioners in alternative medicine often recommend coffee enemas for `` cleansing of the colon '' due to its stimulus of peristalsis , although mainstream medicine has not proved any benefits of the practice.RisksMany notable effects of coffee are related to its caffeine content.Many coffee drinkers are familiar with `` coffee jitters '' , a nervous condition that occurs when one has had too much caffeine . Coffee can also increase blood pressure among those with high blood pressure , but follow-up studies showed that coffee still decreased the risk of dying from heart disease in the aggregate . Coffee can also cause insomnia in some , while paradoxically it helps a few sleep more soundly . It can also cause anxiety and irritability , in some with excessive coffee consumption , and some as a withdrawal symptom . There are also gender-specific effects , in some PMS sufferers it increases the symptoms , and it can reduce fertility in women , also it may increase the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women , and there may be risks to a fetus if a pregnant woman drinks 8 or more cups a day ( 48 U.S. fl oz or 1.4 L or more ) .A February 2003 Danish study of 18,478 women linked heavy coffee consumption during pregnancy to significantly increased risk of stillbirths ( but no significantly increased risk of infant death in the first year ) . `` The results",0

I told my boyfriend she could n't have meant it , because it was said during sex .

"sbc offers different price rates for dsl . what is the best if my son will be playing x box live ? is there different speeds with different pricing ? with what we have now he 's playing people that have cable dsl and he keeps getting booted off Xbox Live is just like any online game . The biggest issue you will ever see has to do with Latency , also known as `` Lag '' . Latency occurs when there are bottlenecks in the general network layout . Think LA freeways at 5pm on a Friday night . Unfortunately this issue is not one you can change , because it has to do with the actual design of the network , so choosing your provider properly is essential.Cable Internet , in its basic form , is a shared medium . This means that every person who subscribes to Cable in your neighborhood shares the same on-ramp to the internet . This is only a problem if there are large numbers of concurrent users in your area.DSL , on the other hand , connects you to the backbone in a more efficient , seperated manner . This has the advantage of being much less susceptible to latency . Unfortunately , this advantage goes down the farther away from the switching office ( CO ) you are . Another thing to consider is newer Cable networks tend to use a different model of communications than the old ones , and so approach DSL levels of service.To sum up : DSL is better than Cable , but tends to be slower . However any speed higher than about 1 meg / sec should be MORE than sufficient to run today 's games .",0

Although walking , and smoking cessation are the first steps .

Many patients who complain of pain at rest , have a history of having worse pain at night while in bed sleeping , with relief from `` dangling their feet from the side of the bed '' . Before you decide to do anything , see your physician if you have not already done so . There are other disease proceses that may mimic peripheral artery occlusive disease . If it is arterial disease he will be able to better answer your questions , after a good examination . If it is warranted , ( after more involved tests ) referal to a vascular surgeon might be necessary . Good luck.http : //www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml ? identifier=4692",0
"how does brokeback mountain end ? I live in a town so republican there are no democrats on the ballots . There is no way it will show here and the local Walmart will not carry the DVD . The library does not carry the book , ( short Story/article ) and I do n't have the money to travel 75 miles and pay $ 10 to see it in Wenatchee . Well , just like in real life , Jack gets murdered for his relations with men . The Good Ol ' Boys , the same people that burn crosses and love a good hangin ' , got their tire irons and tortured him to death -- most likely the father-in-law and some of his drinkin ' buddies . Ennis shuffles around in life , without two nickels to rub together , thinking about Jack , knowing he will never have a relationship with or ever fall in love with anyone again . The real sadness is that two people who in a one-in-a-million chance found true love -- their soulmates , but could not make it work . They tried to blend , and live their lives together discreetly , but it just did n't work . Jack had more interactions with other men , so he was more likely to be caught.The frustrating thing about the 60 's and 70 's was people 's inability to talk . The most was said when nobody was talking . Ennis 's wife tried to talk about it , but Ennis ran out during a Thanksgiving dinner . In the end , Ennis learns about Jack 's death from his wife , who tells a lie to cover up the truth , saying while Jack was changing a tire it blew off the rim and killed him . We are n't told if Ennis believes the lie or knows what really happened . Ennis goes to Jack 's parents ' ranch . He goes to Jack 's room , and finds both his shirt and Jack 's shirt from their summer together on the mountain , hung together on the same hangar . Jack 's mother loved Jack , regardless of his sexuality . There was so much said between the mother and Ennis without one word spoken -- and that was the beauty of the film . The mother knew how much Jack loved Ennis , and she realized that both she and Ennis both loved Jack more than any other people in his life . Jack 's early end was felt most deeply by Ennis and the mother , and you could see the pain in both characters.The only thing of value in Ennis 's life is his love and relationship with Jack . He loves his daughters , but that really is n't on the same level as his relationship with Jack . He keeps the two shirts on the hangar in his closet hung on a peg . This is a symbol of their love -- the shirts being on the same hangar , being together , signify their oneness . That 's why Ennis could not love again , because he became one ( stop the star wars jokes ) with the one he loved . His acknowledgment , and his keeping the shirts , showed that his love for Jack would never die.What I respect most about the film was the way both Jack and Ennis were portrayed . It was very anti-media : there were no men wearing women 's clothes , or talking with lisps , or waving their hands around like little girls . There were no metrosexual marketing schemes , lipstic , or bulging 70 's bell-bottom pants . These were guys who grew up in rural areas and participated as men in all activities , including rodeo , ranching , and making babies . They fully functioned in the tradional sense , in the way people think `` men '' are supposed to act . The only difference was they fell in love with each other . When you escape all the homosexual stereotypes , I ended up forgetting about the gender altogether -- I saw two people in love , a love forbidden by local customs and culture . I wish you could see the film for yourself . Many people I am sure reacted like ol ' Winky . Hate is found in many forms , and passed on from generation to generation , In God 's Holy Name , of course , to give it extra punch . The one and only God of creation , the God who bore me and bore the universe , would never condemn true love between two people , period . Rules and cultural moreys are created by man , for man . Love transcends all those boundaries , and should be respected and nurtured . If hell exists , you can bet there is a special place in hell for people who go out and torture other people ...",0

"How should the nuclear standoff with Iran be resolved ? I do n't understand . US suggests they want to attack Israel .

Many European countries or the neighbour Arab Emirats , are more than developed wihtout nuclear power . A military strike would be the worse option .

Only because they do n't have a good relationship with Israel or US , it should n't be banned . If in 10 years they dare to attack someone with nukes , they will be easily smashed back .

"If we can be baptised by the holy spirit , do we need to be baptised by water ? I read in the `` acts '' that Jesus told the apostles that from now that baptism will be by the holy spirit , while john baptised by water . Does that mean baptism is not a necessary process ? should we say that `` when we enter the kingdom of God , we will be baptised by the holy spirit '' .NOTE : any answers that has nothing to do with this question will never ever get 10 points and will never be put in voting , this is in order to serve the community and more people , this is a serious quesiton . God bless you . The absence of water baptism does not disqualify one from entering into the Kingdom of heaven , in example ; the thief on the cross goes to paridise without water baptism or for that matter without the baptism of the holy spirit ( since Jesus is not dead as a man yet ) Jesus does command us to get baptized in water as a symbol for expressing an inward change by showing an outward appearance .",0
Why ca n't the telemarketer hear me say `` Hello '' when I answer the phone ? Everytime a telemarketer calls I say `` Hello . '' Then it takes a few seconds and they say `` Hello ? '' As if they are wondering if anyone answered . Why is this the case ? Telemarketers do not actually dial the phone calls . They sit at a desk and wait to be alerted that they are being connected to a call through their call system . It would be a waste of time for telemarketers to wait on the line for someone to answer the phone because there could be no answer or they could get your voicemail . Your voice actually triggers the connection . They do not hear you say hello because they have not been connected to you yet .,0
"How often or how much can I drink Coke without it rotting my teeth ? I think it depends on how you drink it and what you do in between . Using a straw should do less damage . Sipping throughout the day should be the worst as you keep the teeth covered constantly . So to improve your intake without doing too much damage to your teeth ( I am not talking about other areas of the body ) I would think you should drink more fewer times a day and use a straw . In between chew gum or eat some other stuff that neutralizes the sugar and acid . I would also talk to a dentist first , as she can better judge how vulnerable your teeth are .",0

"As earth gains weight , will it affect its rotation on its axis and its revolution around the sun ? Will the contniuous weight gain of earth affect the orbits of other planets and our solar system as well as the entire universe ? If the mass of the earth changes , then if we could `` weigh '' it on a scale , its weight would change . Changing the mass of the earth definitely affects its rotation rate , and its orbit , as well as all the other orbits of bodies in the solar system , including the sun , and of course , bodies outside the solar system . All of the laws of motion and gravity that the earth and the other bodies obey depend on the mass of the earth.How might mass of the earth change ? 1 . The earth is gaining mass every year from meteorites of course . The amount of material falling to earth is estimated to be between 37,000 and 78,000 tons per year ( see first reference ) .I am not sure if this includes material from the solar wind , or from the tails of comets , or from cosmic dust ( see below ) which are also sources of material from space that the earth gathers , but I believe it does . 2 . The earth is also losing material because we are now launching satellites and sending space vehicles off on missions . 3 . At the boundary of the atmosphere and space ( the exosphere ) where air can escape into space . The amount of air that is lost depends on how fast the ions , atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere are moving . I have including a web page that discusses this below . 4 . When radioactive material decays , it can emit electromagnetic radiation ( gamma rays ) that carry off a tiny amount of mass . Some of these gamma rays might make it all the way out of earth 's atmosphere , but very few I would imagine . I am not sure how to estimate this . It would definitely have to be balanced against the flood of radiation that the earth is being bathed in by the sun and by cosmic rays . Without doing any calculations , I would guess that the earth is probably experiencing a net gain of mass every year , and this increases the force of gravity between it and all the other celestial bodies . It also will make it spin more slowly , as the moment of inertia of the earth changes . However , the gain is very small . From the figures above , the earth 's mass increases by roughly 10^ ( -15 ) per cent per year ; that is , the earth experiences a gain of about 0.000000000000001 % per year .",0

"What is an alpha male ? An alpha male or alpha female is the individual in the community whom the others follow and defer to . Humans and their nearest species-relatives , the chimpanzees , show deference to the alpha of the community by ritualized gestures such as bowing , allowing the alpha to walk first in a procession , or standing aside when the alpha challenges . Canines also show deference to the alpha pair in their pack , by allowing them to be the first to eat and , usually , the only pair to mate . Wolves are a well known example of this.The status of alpha is generally achieved by means of superior physical prowess . However in certain highly-social species such as the Bonobo apes , the alpha can use more indirect methods ( such as political alliances ) to oust the ruling alpha and take his/her place .",0

"Is body odor really an aphrodisiac ? Here 's some text from a 2002 study reported in Neuroendrocrinology Letters that indicates male pheremones ( at the heart of `` body odor '' ) may have a positive attractiveness effect to a majority of women.Previous research has revealed that natural and synthetic pheromones can enhance ratings of opposite sex attractiveness . The present study investigated the effects of exposure to male axillary secretions on female ratings of the sexual attractiveness of male stimuli . Thirty-two female undergraduates , half of whom were contraceptive pill users , rated male vignette characters and photographs of male faces on aspects of attractiveness . On two separate study days , corresponding to different phases of their menstrual cycle , stimuli were presented while exposed to male axillary pheromones and under a control condition ( no pheromone ) . The order of testing was balanced with respect to pheromone/control condition and menstrual cycle phase . Pheromone exposure resulted in significantly higher attractiveness ratings of vignette characters and faces . Use of the contraceptive pill or menstrual cycle phase had equivocal effects on some vignette items and neither had any influence on female ratings of male facial attractiveness . The results of this study suggest that exposure to natural male axillary pheromones can significantly enhance female perceptions of various aspects of male attractiveness. -- -- -There 's no question that overt and extreme body odor is repellent to many ( and certainly it can be ! ) -- especially since we 've been trained by countless advertisements to find it so . However , it 's an evolutionary adaptation of some kind , which ( certainly in the pre-bath eras ) must have operated as a signal of some kind to females : of health , of strength , of non-sickness perhaps .",0

MistWing SilverTail adding water to potassium already causes it to explode . you are correct - the reaction releases hydrogen and forms an oxide of potassium , and the considerably exothermic nature of the reaction generates enough heat to ignite the hydrogen gas . so , mixing water and potassium solid typically causes a big-time explosion - just like mixing water and sodium.as for the powdered magnesium in there - i suspect that the explosion would scatter it , and it might ignite - the ignition temperature for magnesium metal is 450 C - so you 'd probably end up with white-hot burning magnesium shrapnel flying everywhere ! so , if you 're ever thinking about making a nasty bomb , sounds like a good way to do it .",0

"I 'm want to be a game designer , but I 'm only 15 . What should I do ? A few things to consider : One , what part of game development interests you ? Broadly speaking , there are three roles involved in the development of games : Programmers - game developers , testers , and tools programmers . These are the people who do the actual work of building the game , and create the program that makes everything happen.Artists - 3d modelers and 2d artists and texturers . These are the people who create the `` look '' of the game - every object that appears on-screen has to be modeled , and the surfaces of the objects need to `` painted '' to resemble whatever they 're supposed to be.Designers - level designers , interaction designers and `` game designers . '' These are the people who figure out how things work , and create the `` feel '' of what it 's like to play the game . There ususally are n't many on a development team , and they often end up doing other organizational work , too.What to study depends on which of these sounds appealing . If you like the idea of game programming , then study how to program and practice writing code for fun . If art appeals , get a 3d modeler or 2d painting software and learn to create things with it . If you want to design , make sure you understand at least a little bit about programming and art , and practice your writing and speaking - designers need to be able to communicate.For all of these roles , learn to play videogames with a critical eye - when a game is n't fun , ask yourself why it is n't fun . When a game is , ask what succeeds about it . What could make it better ? A good way to learn about what makes games fun is to play and create board and card games - learning games as a whole , and being able to talk about them intelligently will be a big help.And , if you decide that gaming is n't for you later , then an education based around the fundamentals of design like that will leave you able to do quite a bit besides gaming.Good luck !",0

"why female breasts are so large compared to other mammals ? if you consider that such a large and chubby organ would be disadvantegous for surviving , how do you explain the evolution of sumptuous female breasts ? i think most of you think that this is associated with breastfeeding . but many mammals breastfeed too , but they dont have such large organs , right ? what is the deal with those nice breasts ? can you figure out what is going on ? There is definitely some severe debate going on concerning this issue . Some have proposed women have prominent breasts as the result of natural or sexual selection . Suggesting since women with large breasts are considered more desirable they would have more suitors and as a result reproduce more often . Others argue that this concept myopic because its based solely on modern Western society 's ideals of what is considered attractive . Those folks would suggest that breast size has seldom been of major importance in most societies . In the majority of societies breasts are just a source of nourishment for infants and young children . Whereas there is a relatively important argument against the latter argument in favor of the former . It would be difficult to believe that there is some `` natural selection '' root for the `` modern western society '' propensity of finding women with large breasts attractive . It would seem unlikely that these sorts of pervasive ideals toward the female form would simply appear out of thin air -- that 's giving Playboy a lot of credit I think.Then minimalistic view of why female breasts become so prominant is that the development of the female breast during puberty is likely the side affect of some biological necessity that is not readily apparent . Perhaps it is simply that human females experience a greater increase in estrogen levels during puberty than do other mammals.I do have to admit that I like the theory mentioned above about the need for larger to prevent suffococation while breast feeding , however , I would reckon that a major contribution to increased breast size may be the increased fatty content of our diet . This may be an explanation for why past cultures did n't have an affinity toward large breasts , because of the lack of high fat content in their diet , there were few women who displayed large breasts . However , because diet was usually a representation of status , there were many female members of aristocracic classes throughout time who were viewed as the most beautiful women of their day . These women tended to be rather Rubenesque . So , maybe it was already engrained in the human race early on.So , it 's not well known the mechanism by which female breasts have become more promenent in comparison to other mamals . Which leads me onece again to my soap box : When it comes to biology/evolution , it 's impossible to answer much of anything when it comes to `` why . '' Things happen for reasons , but very little of -- if any -- biology happens for a reason . Breasts are n't more prominent in the human species when compared to other mammalian species because of any designed reason . It could be that women with bigger breasts are more likely to mate , or mate more often , than women with smaller breasts , maybe it is our diet , whatever the reason that allows for breast sizes to increase , the genetics that allow for this to happen was determined by hundreds of the thousands -- if not millions -- of years of selective pressures that selected these genes as the most fit . These pressures have altered and molded these genes to their current status .",0

"does muscle really weigh more than fat ? my daughter and i have a debate on this ? yes muscles weigh more than fat here is why ... .Muscle weighs more than fat because muscle cells that compose muscle are denser than fat cells . Why is this ? Because fat cell cytoplasm contains mostly oils ( lipids ) , whereas muscle cell cytoplasm contains mostly contractile proteins ( myosin and actin ) suspended in an aqueous ( watery ) environment . Lipids in general are less dense than water . You can prove this by mixing salad oil with water in a bottle and shaking it . Eventually , the oil will separate from the water and float to the top to form a lighter layer floating on top of the water . This lowered density of lipids make fatty tissue less heavy than muscle .",0

"How do you help a people who lost 6 million souls ? My great grandfather was captured brought to Auswitz Natzi death camp and tortured for a long time untill one day he escaped succesfull but while losing his friends who were shot and killed by the Nazis in an attempt to escape . Out of 26 only 4 lived . 6 Million of my anscestors perrsihed in what is called the Holocost . Oh ! `` Tears '' This is so hard to write ! Can you imagine being 10 years old in one of those cattle cars not knowing where these nazis were taking you and then seeing the smoke from the creamatroiums . You ask , where is my father or mother and someone points to the smoke and sais , there , they are going to heaven . `` Weeps ! `` .We must never forget the holocost folks ! But I wonder if any of you have an idea of how this Jew from a surviving family of the holocost could honar and help other such families ? I just do n't know how to express my heart and its breaking when i considder 6 million of my own people dead at the hand of Hitler . Paperclips is a very powerful documentary and I agree , EVERYONE should watch it . It should be a requirement in school . As should be Schindlers List . All through my childhood I heard my fraternal grandparents talk about Hitler and the Nazis . They came to the state not long after he came into power and started persecuting the jews . While not jewish themselves they had many close friends that were and could n't stand to watch them suffer . Knowing this was only the beginning they left Germany and came to the US . If Hitlers name was mentioned around my Grandma tears welled up in her eyes and she called hi the worst evil that had ever happened to mankind . But by far the most powerful and moving thing I have ever felt was when I was 16 . I was visiting relatives in Europe with my Aunt . Knowing what I was studying in school that semester we took a side trip and she took me to Auschwitz so that i could truely understand what I was being taught , though we were n't Jewish she wanted me to understand . As long as I live i will remember that , seeing the ovens and hearing what happened there . It was almost as if that place screamed in pain still for the evil that was committed there . No member of our tour group was left dry eyed by the time it was over . The most vivid memory of it was seeing the ovens then hearing the older lady next to us break down in tears . Turns out she was dying of cancer and before she departed this earth she had to see where he parents and brothers had perished.To so many of us evil of this enormity is hard to grasp and fathom but every day of our lives we see or hear a small part of it . Every time you utter a racial slur , make a biggoted remark , show intolerance to anothers religion or belief system you are perpetuating Hitlers legacy . Because that is what it was , hatered and biggotry and intolerance . It took 6 million people dying for the rest of the world to understand that lesson , of what that mindframe and and those views can bring about . And the worst thing we can do is forget it or glorify the kinds of acts or thinking that brought on all of those deaths . Because it was n't hitler alone that killed them all , it was people who felt the way he did and thought nothing of it . Look around you and i bet you have met people like that . Or maybe you are yourself , so none of this has gone away and all the lessons have not sunk in . Six million people , our minds truely ca n't wrap around that number . All because of intolerance and biggotry . As you read through the answers to some of the questions on these pages you can see it here as well . Intolerance to other peoples view or religions , a supreme and superior attitude because 'I am right my religion is right the rest of you are wrong ' . That attitude is what helped take 6 million people from this earth . That is what ALLOWED the nazis to do what they did . They saw those in those camps as wrong and not as good as themselves , that they were superior . Those camps still exhist today as a reminder of that evil . And believe me if you walk through the gates you can feel it , you can feel the pain and anguish that went on there . It screams at you from every inch of it . 6 MILLION people killed because someone else was sure they were right and they were superior . Those shows on the History Channel SHOULD upset you ! They should upset you every time you see them and never should you become callous to them or what they show . That is about the only reminder this world has left of what can come from biggotry and hatered.Next time , before you write out from your superior point of view and point out how everyone else is wrong , or laugh at an ethnic joke or make fun of someone because they are different think about Hitler and what that kind of mindset can cause ... SIX MILLION SOULS TAKEN FROM THIS EARTH BECAUSE THE NAZIS THOUGHT THEY WERE BETTER AND KNEW THEY WERE RIGHT !",0
"How do you find domain and range of pre-cal compositions ? The best way to find domain and range is to graph the function . If you graph the function that you have given as an example , you will notice that it is undefined at x=0 . Since it is undefined at this point , the domain of the function is the real numbers minus 0 . The range in general is slighly more difficult to find , but in this case is easy to find . This function goes to positive infinity when x approaches 0 from the left , and negative infinity when x approaches 0 from the right . The range of this function is all real numbers .",0

"how to seek a ideal job ? I would say the first thing to do is identify what you consider ideal and perhaps write it down . With those qualities in mind you can begin to think seriously about who you would want to work for , where you would want to work and what kind of work you would want to do . As you are thinking about that , take a look at your resume / cv . Does your knowledge , skills , experiences and education align you with your perfect job or do you need additional skills and training to help make you more marketable . If there are gaps , now is the time to address them.With that accomplished , you can set out with your list of qualities and your resume to find your perfect job . I suggest the best approach to this facet of your job search is to use a mixed approach . You can put your resume on the boards , but my experience has proven that it is n't the most effecient or effective way to find a job . Additionally , scour the job boards ( Monster.com , Hotjobs . com , Careerbuilder.com and any niche sites that you may know of or be a member of ) and identify jobs that you would want to apply for . Make sure that you are not kidding yourself or overestimating your abilities.While all of this is going on get the word out , talk to everyone you know and let them know that you are on the market and what kind of work you are looking for . Networking is one of the most effective ways to find a job.This is n't an exhaustive step-by-step guide , but it should help you get started . All of this advice comes from a number of years of experience as a recruiter for large corporations .",0
"when will the iraqi dinar gain in value ? In about 20 years when the country is finally able to start producing more oil than they are consuming . The value of the dinar is also dependent on many other things , like the actions of the Central Bank of Iraq . At present it has essentially a fixed value of 1477 dinars to the dollar . This value is being held fixed because all of the contractors working in Iraq need a stable exchange rate in order to operate . The value has not fluctuated by more than 1 % since the exchange began operating a couple of years ago . The Iraqi dinar probably has as much potential to lose value when it is finally traded on the open market as it does to rise . The Iraq economy will be oil-export dependent and at present Iraq is not producing as much oil as it was before the war . In fact much of the oil Iraq is presently exporting is being offset by imports of refined products like diesel and gasoline . Because oil production can not be increased under the present unstable conditions , it may be decades before Iraq becomes a significant oil exporter . Many of the wells in Iraq were permanently damaged by being shut down for the war . These wells will have to be redrilled or repaired and at present this is almost impossible . An oil rig makes a very vulnerable target and no oil company is going to risk its workers and assets on something that will become a target for bombers and snipers . It often takes years of planning to prepare for drilling an oil well , and then can take months or years to develop a new discovery . It could easily be 5 or 10 years before Iraq sees new oil production even it it starts tomorrow , and it wo n't . If you bought dinars I suggest you frame them and hang them on the wall . That may be their best use , since you ca n't redeem them at any bank outside of Iraq.Here is the link to the Central Bank of Iraq currency exchange : http : //www.cbiraq.org/cbs6.htm",0
"im doing a project , does anyone know if Could a World Of Swimmers Raise The Sea Level ? ? ? ? ? plz answer ? I believe that you can simplify the problem with a few assumptions . First , it should not matter how deep the ocean is , raising sea level is a surface effect . Add a turkey to pots filled to the top with water and push it under and the same amount of water will spill regardless of how large the pots are . However , push the turkey under in partially filled pots and the level will rise more in a `` just right '' pot than one twice as large in surface area.Most people can just barely float or sink depending on fat content , so it is justified on average to assume a person will exactly displace their weight in water or their volume in water . Weight will be easier.You must select a size for the population and then calculate an averasge weight for babies , children , men and women . You could estimate the average weight of a typical family perhaps . You only need to show your calculations and reasons.Next you need to assume whether your population is swimming under water ( most displacement ) or with heads and arms above water ( least displacement ) . Most displacement under water will be easier , especially because some float better in salty sea water.Finally , you need to estimate the weight of the entire population and convert that to cubic feet of water where water weighs 62.4 lbs per cubic feet . Divide that by the square feet of surface area of all the oceans and seas and you will have the rise in sea level , to whatever decimal places you chose . Good luck .",0

"CAN ANYBODY CLARIFY ? If a person suffered from amnesia and then was cured would they remember that they forgot ? It is hard to say.The underlying cause of amnesia is critical to answer this question.If you are talking a traumatic event to the brain , then the memories could be permanetly lost . The physical structure of the brain could have been damaged beyond repair and the information contained there would be lost.Sometimes , the area is just injured and takes time to heal . In this case , over time the memories would begin to come back as the brain reroutes synapses to accommodate the injury.If it was a psychological amensia , then it may or may not come back depending on how the person can cope with the experience . In this case , there is usually very little physical brain involvment.In general , in a highly stressfulevent , adrenalize and stres hormones cause memory to be faulty at best . So in an crisis people rarely recollect events in the most accurate manner.For a whole lot of unsubsantiated opinion , see the Wikipedia entry : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmnesiaOr for Types of amnesia : http : //ahsmail.uwaterloo.ca/kin356/amnesia/amnesia2.htmlhttp : //www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php ? newsid=9673For a better reference check out http : //news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/a-b/167771.stm",0

"Does debris affect a tornadoes wind speed ? The funnel of a tornado is actually clear . The only way we actually see the tornado is because of the debris that is circulating inside the funnel . The wind speed of the tornado will not increase because of debris . Debris can only be a hinderance to a tornado . To help you think about this , think about a very large piece of debris , lets say a mountain . Now while the mountain is not going to be picked up and tossed around like dirt , cows , trucks and some houses , it is still something that is getting in the way of a tornado . The mid-west experiences far more tornadoes than any other region . This is because they are uninhibited from forming . Basically the more you put in the way of the funnel the more difficult it will be for that funnel ( aka the tornado ) to form . To put it on a level that everyone can relate to , think of your toilet . When you flush the toilet the water starts to swirl . A funnel begins to appear in the water and eventually everything goes away . What happens if there is too much TP ( debris ) in the way ? The funnel never forms and you get a clog .

"If a person has a child in the US , and they themselves are n't citizens , are they entitled to any benefits ? Can they receive Section 8 or welfare benefits for themselves and their child ? Would they be forced to return to their country with the child ? Is citizen status of child enough to gain any benefits ? They are entitled to a limited number of benefits because the US will not take away the child from you ( do n't worry about that unless you prove that you are terrible parents ) Anyway returning to the question - Since the child was born in the US is thus a US citizen . You can confirm that because the child will be issued a Birth Certificate by the state and a Social Security Number by the SS Office . Based on your income your child and for a certain period of time the mother can qualify for medical aid by the govt . You need to get in touch with the hospital 's social workers or the local Social Services Department office . Do that ASAP as the child will need doctor 's visits and routine shots . There are also programs such as Food Stamps and such that will help in the financial for taking care of the child . In case the parents visas expire and have to return back to their country , they can take the baby with them . Just ensure that you have with you the ss , birth certificate , ( I am not sure about the US passport though ) . But rest assured worrying about the citizenship should not be the biggest concern as much as the care of both the `` little baby '' and the mother . Good luck . It 's still good if you can ask an immigration attorney ( remember the first visit is always free @ least in the tri-state ) .",0

"What are the effects that ketosis has on the adult body ? A few yrs ago i began losing a substantial amount of weight , my drs did a battery of tests from diabetis to thyroid- they came up with ketosis saying that is what caused the weight loss and explains my neverending thirst and bouts with dehydration . I have researched and I still dont understand ketosis . Anyone else have this experience ? `` Ketosis , which is one of the body 's processes for the metabolism of body fat , should not be confused with ketoacidosis ( severe ketosis which causes the blood to become acidic ) , a medical condition induced by diabetes , that is usually accompanied by dehydration , hyperglycemia , and insulin deficiency . Since insulin is required to utilize glucose , lack of insulin causes an energy crisis and the body goes to extremes to produce more glucose and also provide ketones for energy . Glucose accumulates to the point that the kidney must use water to spill it into the urine , losing that water and causing dehydration in the process . The dehydration exacerbates the acidosis in a vicious cycle . Alcoholic ketoacidosis is also an energy crisis but of different origin . Because alcohol causes dehydration and blocks the first step of gluconeogenesis , the body is unable to synthesize enough glucose to meet its needs , thus the energy crisis begins.The breath of people in a ketagenic state commonly contains acetone , detectable as a sweet smell that may be mistaken for ethyl alcohol.Deliberately induced ketosis through a low-carbohydrate diet has been used to treat medical conditions . The ketogenic diet is an approach to treating epilepsy , and the Atkins Nutritional Approach is marketed for treating obesity . ''",0

For example , in most regions of the United States eggs are generally white , while in the northeast of that country , and in the United Kingdom eggs are generally light-brown . These habits may be associated with perceptions of greater purity in white-shelled eggs or greater wholesomeness in brown-shelled eggs",0

"what is the chemical structure of the spider 's net ? The dragline silk of the Golden Orb-Weaving spider is the most studied in scientific research . Spider silk is a natural polypeptide , polymeric protein and is in the scleroprotein group which also encompasses collagen ( in ligaments ) and keratin ( nails and hair ) . These are all proteins which provide structure . The protein in dragline silk is fibroin ( Mr 200,000-300,000 ) which is a combination of the proteins spidroin 1 and spidroin 2 . The exact composition of these proteins depends on factors including species and diet . Fibroin consists of approximately 42 % glycine and 25 % alanine as the major amino acids . The remaining components are mostly glutamine , serine , leucine , valine , proline , tyrosine and arginine . Spidroin 1 and spidroin 2 differ mainly in their content of proline and tyrosine .",0

"How is Iron ore mined ? Modern mines , in Minnesota and Michigan in the US , and Eastern Canada mine taconite . Taconite is a term to describe magnetite ore that is very hard and fine-grained . Taconite must be first processed into iron oxide pellets by crushing and magnetic separation of the magnetite to concentrate the iron to about 66 % before it can be used in steel-making.Taconite mining involves moving tremendous amounts of ore and waste . The waste comes in two forms , bedrock in the mine ( mullock ) that is n't ore , and unwanted minerals which are an intrinsic part of the ore rock itself ( gangue ) . The mullock is mined and piled in waste dumps , and the gangue is separated during the beneficiation process and is removed as tailings . Taconite tailings are mostly the mineral quartz , which is chemically inert . This material is stored in large , regulated water settling ponds.In Australia iron ore is won from three main sources ; massive magnetite ore as at Savage River , Tasmania ; pisolite `` channel-iron '' ore derived by mechanical erosion of primary banded-iron formations and accumulated in alluvial channels such at Robe River , Western Australia ; and banded iron formation related ores such as at Newman , Hamersley and Koolyanobbing , Western Australia . Other types of ore are coming to the fore recently , such as oxidised ferruginous hardcaps , for instance iron ore deposits near Argyle , Western Australia.World production averages one billion metric tons of raw ore annually . The world 's largest producer of iron ore is the Brazilian mining corporation CVRD , followed by Australian companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto Group . China is currently the largest consumer of iron ore , which translates to be the world 's largest steel producing country . Iron ore is common worldwide , but commercial mining operations are dominated by the countries listed below : Estimated iron ore production in million tons for 2004 , according to U.S. Geological Survey [ 2 ] China 280 Australia 220 Brazil 220 India 110 Russia 95 United States 54 Ukraine 66 South Africa 40 Canada 31 Sweden 22 Venezuela 18 Kazakhstan 17 Iran 16 Mauritania 10 Mexico 12 Other countries 40 Total world 1250 [ edit ] RefiningPure elemental iron is virtually unknown on the surface of the Earth except as wüstite from meteorites and very rare forms of deep mantle xenoliths . Therefore , all sources of iron used by human industry exploit iron oxide minerals , the primary form which is used in industry being hematite.However , in some situations , more inferior iron ore sources have been used by industrialised societies when access to high-grade hematite ore was not available . This has included utilisation of taconite in the United State , particularly during World War II , and goethite or bog ore used during the Revolutionary war and the Napoleonic wars . Magnetite is often used because it is magnetic and hence easily liberated from the gangue minerals.Inferior sources of iron ore generally required beneficiation . Due to the high density of hematite relative to silicates , beneficiation usually involves a combination of crushing and milling as well as heavy liquid separation . This is achieved by passing the finely crushed ore over a bath of solution containing bentonite or other agent which increases the density of the solution . When the density of the solution is properly calibrated , the hematite will sink and the silicate mineral fragments will float and can be removed.Magnetite is beneficiated by crushing and then separating the magnetite from the gangue minerals with a magnet . This is usually so efficient that lower grade ore can be treated when it is magnetite than a comparable grade of hematite ore , especially when the magnetite is quite coarse.To convert an oxide of iron to metallic iron it must be smelted .",0

"what is cancer ? Simple answer : A cell in the body that has gone out of control causing a disease.Cancer is a class of diseases characterized by uncontrolled division of cells and the ability of these cells to invade other tissues , either by direct growth into adjacent tissue ( invasion ) or by implantation into distant sites ( metastasis ) . This unregulated growth is caused by damage to DNA , resulting in mutations to genes that control cell division . Several mutations may be required to transform a normal cell into a malignant cell . These mutations are often caused by chemicals or physical agents called carcinogens . Some mutations occur spontaneously , or they can be inherited ( germ line mutations . ) Cancer can cause many different symptoms , depending on the site and character of the malignancy and whether there is metastasis . Cancer may be painless . A definitive diagnosis usually requires the histologic examination of tissue by a pathologist . This tissue is obtained by biopsy or surgery . Once diagnosed , cancer is usually treated with surgery , chemotherapy , or radiation.If untreated , cancers may eventually cause death . Cancer is mainly a disease of later years , and is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries . Most cancers can be treated and many cured , especially if treatment begins early . Many forms of cancer are associated with exposure to environmental factors , such as tobacco smoking , alcohol , and certain viruses . Some of these can be avoidable , and public health and vaccination programmes are important on a global scale.Another viewpoint : A general term for about 100 diseases characterized by uncontrolled , abnormal growth of cells . The resulting mass , or tumor , can invade and destroy surrounding normal tissues . Cancer cells from the tumor can spread through the blood or lymph ( the clear fluid that bathes body cells ) to start new cancers in other parts of the body ( metastases ) .",0

"Intel Pentium Processor upgrade ? I have a Compaq Presario 3020 Desktop PC with Intel Pentium processor ( 166 MHz ) . I would like to know if I upgrade the processor and put in a faster one ? And if so , what processor ? Also how do I open ( take the cover off ) the Compaq Presario 3020 Desktop PC ? You could upgrade the processor . The highest processor you can upgrade to is a Pentium 233 MMX ( the last model before Intel moved to the Pentium II format ) . It 's not much of an upgrade but it 's up to you if it 's worth the time to learn how to do it . Money should n't be a probably as the 233 MMX probably goes for $ 5 or less on ebay or some flea market.To open the Presario case , there are probably some screws on the left hand side in the rear ( when looking directly at the front ) . They secure the left panel to the case and consists of two ( maybe three ) screws . If you tug at the left panel by pushing it towards the back and it still does n't open , it might be a U-shaped cover and you 'll need to unscrew the screws on the right panel on the rear . Again , this may vary as different vendors had different ways to take the cover off . I know that Sony desktops at the time did n't use screws but had pressure mechanisms that held the panel in place .",0

"who is Azazel in the Bible ? Azazel in LeviticusLeviticus 16:8 tells that the Lord ordered his high priest , Aaron , to 'place lots upon the two goats , one marked for the Lord and the other marked for Azazel ' on the Jewish Day of Atonement . The goat designated by lot for the Lord is to be used as a sin offering , while the goat designated for Azazel `` shall be left standing alive before the Lord , to make expiation with it and to send it off to the wilderness for Azazel . '' ( Lev 16:10 ) Aaron was to `` lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities and transgressions of the Israelites , whatever their sins , putting them on the head of the goat ; and it shall be sent off to the wilderness through a designated an . Thus the goat shall carry on it all their iniquities to an inaccessible region ; and the goat shall be set free in the wilderness . '' ( Lev 16:21-22 ) Leviticus also says that `` He who set the Azazel-goat free shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water ; after that he may reenter the camp . '' ( 16:26 ) From this passage in Leviticus , it would seem that Azazel is conceived of as a personal being , as lots were drawn for the Lord and for him . Also , Leviticus mentions that Azazel lives in the wilderness , as do the Se'irim . Because of this ritual , Azazel is known as the `` scapegoat . '' The goat that is sent to Azazel is not as a sacrifice , but as a symbol that there is no longer any unexpiated guilt . Both the goat and the man who leads away the goat are unclean , and the only way the man can reenter the camp is by washing his clothes and bathing . Azazel in the Apocalypse of AbrahamIn the Apocalypse of Abraham , Azazel is portrayed as an unclean bird which came down upon the sacrifice which Abraham prepared . This is in reference to Genesis 15:11 `` Birds of prey came down upon the carcasses , and Abram drove them away . '' `` And the unclean bird spoke to me and said , 'What are you doing , Abraham , on the holy heights , where no one eats of drinks , nor is there upon them food for men . But these all will be consumed by fire and ascend to the height , they will destroy you . ' And it came to pass when I saw the bird speaking I said this to the angel : 'What is this , my lord ? ' And he said , 'This is disgrace , this is Azazel ! ' And he said to him , 'Shame on you Azazel ! For Abraham 's portion is in heaven , and yours is on earth , for you have selected here , ( and ) become enamored of the dwelling place of your blemish . Therefore the Eternal Ruler , the Mighty One , has given you a dwelling on earth . Through you the all-evil spirit ( is ) a liar , and through you ( are ) wrath and trials on the generations of men who live impiously . '' - Apocalypse of Abraham 13:4-9The Apocalypse of Abraham also associates Azazel with Hell . Abraham says to him `` May you be the firebrand of the furnace of the earth ! Go , Azazel , into the untrodden parts of the earth . For your heritage is over those who are with you '' ( 14:5-6 ) There is also the idea that God 's heritage ( the created world ) is largely under the dominion of evil . It is `` shared with Azazel '' ( 20:5 ) Azazel is also identified with the serpent which tempted Eve . His form is described as a dragon with `` hands and feet like a man 's , on his back six wings on the right and six on the left . '' ( 23:7 ) Finally , the Apocalypse of Abraham says that the wicked will `` putrefy in the belly of the crafty worm Azazel , and be burned by the fire of Azazel 's tongue . '' ( 31:5 ) Here again , there is another reference to Azazel as being Hell .",0

"Why the shape of rainbow is as a semi-circle ? When light is refracted off of droplets of water it enables you to see all the colors that make up white light ( sunlight , even light from bulbs . ) creating what people more commonly refer to as a rainbow .

It does use dry ice and isopropyl alcohol though . It 's kind of complicated but would be worth it in the end . You might even win depending on the competition .,0

"how to make working habits in pupils ? Keep high expectations and build accountability into your system .

"When did Standard Amnerican English evolve ? When did `` American English '' become the standard ? What `` English '' did the Founding Fathers speak ? ( British , American , a mixture ? ) Different dialects of English have different standards . Standard American English is the standard for many Americans , but British people have a different standard , and so forth . So American English is n't really the standard for everyone ( although it is for many if they have economic or cultural ties to the United States ) .As for how the standard evolved , there have always been standards . In general , the dialect of whoever 's in power is considered the standard , because people want to be like that powerful group . Americans who are trying to speak Standard American English do so because they think it will give them social power . What 's interesting , though , is that Standard American English is just agreed upon as the standard by many Americans even though it does n't belong to a particular region.The Founding Fathers spoke a dialect that is different from either American dialects or British dialects today . They were British , but in the meantime English has evolved in both places .",0

"do u think that lies saves u from bein ur self ? I do n't think I would use the word 'saves ' . I 'll ignore your grammar and spelling and whatnot and try to answer what I think you might be asking.To say that lies 'save ' you from being yourself implies that you do n't like who you are and that you think that the fabrications are better than reality . In fact , it 's the opposite . Lies , if you tell them often , do separate you from who you really are in that they are false , and provide the one you 're lying to with a false impression of you . They tend to amalgamate until you 're boxed in by your own stories . They start to add up and keeping them all straight is difficult , and there are almost always discrepancies . If you lie too much , it can make people hate you for deceiving them . If there 's something you do n't like about your life , so much as to lie about it , then I would suggest changing who you are instead . Fix it , and then you can be honest with everyone , yourself included.However , if you must lie , I would stay as absolutely close to the truth as possible . It makes them that much more believable .",0

Medically it is used in the treatment of hypokalemia and associated conditions , for digitalis poisoning , and as an electrolyte replenisher . Brand names include K-Dur® , Klor-Con® , Micro-K® , and Kaon Cl® . Side effects can include gastrointestinal discomfort including nausea and vomiting , diarrhea and bleeding of the gut .

"What is your opinion of scientific medicine ... ? Do you think doctors , drug companies , etc . have ( in general ) our best interest in mind ? Do you think we have become a society too dependent on pills ? Do you think there is a real , significant benefit to using herbs and natural `` cures '' and preventatives as opposed to either using `` medicine '' or not using anything ? How do you deal with the people who think you are a quack for believing in natural remedies ? That 's quite a bit to sort through . I 'll do my best.I believe that individual doctors almost always have the best interests of their patients in mind . Medicine as a whole , however , is far more interested in the bottom line . This applies especially to the drug companies . From what I understand certain diseases do n't have enough people suffering from them to make it profitable to research treatments for them . Or , if the research has been done , there is not enough profit in manufacturing drugs to treat these people . I 've even read that there are boutique chemists who make , by hand , very small runs of certain drugs at no profit to themselves , simply to help out.As far as I 'm concerned , this is inexcusable . Do I have a solution ? No . Are alternative treatments viable ? I 'm sure that sometimes they are and sometimes they are not . Again , the problem comes down to making a buck . People who are suffering are , unfortunately , easy marks and snake-oil-salesmen have known this since the dawn of civilization.The problem becomes sorting the con-men from the well-meaning , but dangerously untrained , from the people with actual remedies . This is very difficult and requires a tremendous amount of work on the part of people who often lack the time and energy to do the necessary legwork because they are sick.Coretta Scott King died seeking medical help from a quack . It is awful that she suffered such an undignified end , but as long as there are people to be taken advantage of , others will do their best to part them from their money . Obviously not all alternative treatments are quackery , but they often get lumped together because of the actions of a few ( many , actually ) bad apples . I would suggest that the alternative-therapy industry engage in harsher self-policing as a way to remove the undeserved black-mark.As for you responding to questions which are specifically targeted at individuals , I welcome this . The thing that I like most about Yahoo Answers is that it is a place that encourages the free exchange of ideas between anybody . I do n't think that anyone can , or should , get upset when a targeted question receives several answers . That 's the best thing about this place . So , feel free to throw your two cents in anytime . I really appreciate your response about Bush and Christians . I 'd be very curious to hear what this man , who presumes to speak for all Christian Americans would have to say about that . Thanks for your input .",0

"A force of 12N is applied to the handle of a screw driver being used to pry the lid off a paint can.. ? As the force moves through a distance of 0.3m , the screwdriver does 3.2 J of work on the lid . What is the EFFICIENCY of the screwdriver ? How did you figure that out.. i cant not figure it out so if anyone can and explain how they did it that would be great . Thanks . ok , all you have to do is figure out how much work it should have been doing , then compare it to the amount of work it actually did by using a percentage . so first of all , W=Fx ( work equals Force times distance ) that means that W= ( 12 ) ( .3 ) =3.6 J of work . Ok , so since it only did 3.2 J , that means .4J were lost somewhere . the efficiency is calculating the efficiency in terms of what percentage of the work that was actually applied was translated into the work energy that was done on the lid . the way you do this is just divide the amount of work it did by the amount of work it should have done ( in an ideal solution ) and then multiply by 100 in order to find the percentage of work it actually did in relation to the work it should have done . 3.2/3.6= .88889 ( x 100 ) = 88.89 % . so basically , in cases with efficiency , you divide the number you solved for by the number they gave you . a good way to figure out which you divide by which is just to randomly try dividing and if the answer is above 1 ( 100 % ) , that 's impossible so you switch them ; )",0

"In calculus , could you explain the process of intergrating by substitution ? teacher doesnt explain very well When you are doing integrations , all you are doing is computing an area under a curve . Sometimes the formula for the area will be obvious to you , from something you already know or recognize . Othertimes , you have to transform the problem into one you know already . This is the method called integration by substitution . For example , suppose you want to integrate the function sqrt ( 1 - x^2 ) with respect to x , between some limits . Most times , you will not remember or recognize this integral . However , you might remember that sqrt ( 1- ( sin a ) ^2 ) is cos a , which you know how to integrate , and therefore if you let x=sin a , you have transformed the integral into one you recognize and can easily solve . There is a HUGE amount of material written on this on the internet and in books , but this should get you started . All you are doing is transforming the problem into one that you can solve easier .",0
"Is it natural to like women with a little more fat that average ? Everyone has there different levels of attraction to others . The only reason why anyone would think it is unnatural to like someone bigger than a stick is because society makes it an issue . If you like a girl with a lil meat then hey why does it matter what anyone else thinks .

They spoke a German dialect that eventually evolved into the Yiddish language . Sephardim were decended from Jews who lived in the Iberian peninsula when it was ruled by the Moors . They were expelled from Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella and moved eastwrd to Greece , Turkey , the Balkans , and other lands . They spoke an archaic Spanish which later became Ladino . Lately , Asian Jews whose ancestry was never European and who had lived in places like Iran since the Roman Diaspora have also started being referred to as Sephardim .",0

"My 4th grade son is haveing MAJOR difficulties at school and I 'm considering homeschooling him.Any ideas ? I 'm having problems with the principal and I 've even talked to the superintendent . I do n't expect much help there but if they 're going to label my son as a `` troublemaker '' or someone who needs `` more counselling than just talking to a therapist '' ( the prinipal told me she thinks he should be `` institutionalized '' which the counsellor even disagrees with ) then I do n't see the point of putting him back into that situation . I live in a very small rural town with very limited counselling options which I am taking advantage of . I do n't have too many disciplinary problems with him at home but at school he 's been having `` meltdowns '' which have caused him to be suspended 2 times in the past 2 weeks plus a 5 day suspension for a comment he supposedly said . I ca n't move him to a nearby town 's school because they do n't accept kids after the start of the second semester . I just want him to pass 4th grade so he can go on to 5th grade with a different principal and hopefully a better prospect . HELP ! I went through a very similar situation and after months of being told by the teacher and the principal that there must be a problem at home , I found out another child was having the same problems mine was . The other mom and I got together and came up with a plan . We each got our child to tell us why the other child was having so much trouble.Turned out there was another child in the class bullying and intimidating ours so badly that there were days they spent all their time huddled under their desks . While I still could not get the school to admit to a problem , I did find a sympathetic vice principal who allowed my child access to her office at any time he felt he could not handle being in the class anymore . It was n't the perfect solution but it got us to the end of that school year and I made sure I had some say in what class he went into the next year . Things improved after that . If you truly are not having discipline problems at home and the only place there really seems to be a problem is at school , then I would be looking very hard at why there is a problem at school . Do n't take the teacher 's word for anything ... that teacher may very well be the problem . Talk to other parents and find out if anyone else is going through something similar to what you are . Make sure your child understands that you know there is a problem and you are doing your best to help . Let him know he has you on his side . Good luck . Sure would like to know the outcome of this one .",0

"Why ca n't we get an acceptable Communications Decency Act and Child Pornography Prevention Act ? First Amendment jurisprduence tightly restricts Congress from enacting such regulations . The Supreme Court has articulated a test in a case called Miller , which states that obscenity is unprotected , but requires it to meet three qualifications : First , the average person , applying community standards , considering the work as a whole , finds that the work appeals to the prurient interest ; second , the work is a patently offensive depiction , applying community standards , of sexual conduct , as defined specifically by law ; and third , as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . That 's a lot of burdens for Congress to reach , and it often includes too much protected speech when trying to identify obscenity.The Court allowed restrictions on child pornography , too , in Ferber , so long as the work , first , visually depicts minors , who , second , are engaged in sexual acts lewdly exhibiting their genitals . The Court later interpreted this prohibition as only concerned with the well-being of children in the creation of pornography , not the fostering of child molesters , and so virtual child pornography was found protected , so long as no children were actually harmed.It seems like the Supreme Court is currently protecting a lot under the First Amendment , even things that seems pretty dangerous or pretty valueless . Congress will have its work cut out to try to pass better regulations that can pass the Court 's scrutiny .",0

"Do Publishing Companies Enforce Copyright Infringement Lawsuits ? I have a friend who was selling solutions manuals on ebay ( PDF files ) and ebay stopped the listings but not before he sold several manuals . My friend is not a bigtime operator and did n't know the copyright laws . One of the publishing companies recently sent him a letter telling him that he commited piracy and that they could sue him for LOTS of money and possibly even have him pay for their law fees . However they also said that they would give him 10 days to accept a resolution in which he would pay the companies all profits derived from the manuals and an additional $ 100 dollars for legal costs incurred to date . If my friend does not accept the resolution will the publishing company file a suit ? Can they really ask for an additional $ 100 dollars ? My friend would love some advice ... preferably from somebody familiar with the law . Thank you ! Ignorance of the law is no excuse and no defense . The oopyright statement is WRITTEN RIGHT IN THE MANUALS your friend was selling !

"Do you think patriotism should be taught in public schools ? Why or Why Not ? I am trying to see how people view this question . Think in terms of freedom of thought . Should we be forced to love this country or should love of country come from the individuals ability to reason ? As a child , I remember reciting the Pledge of Allegiance on a daily basis up to a certain point - exactly what year we stopped escapes me at the moment , however . I do n't have a problem with that - as a United States citizen , I do n't mind the occasional exercise in patriotism.However , before it can be taught in schools ( if ever ) , there needs to be a consensus on how the concept is presented . The last thing I 'd want is some stereotypical militant white supremacist or some disenchanted cynic teaching the course or devising the curriculum.How 's *that* for a somewhat-less-than-concrete answer ? Truthfully , I hate any type of mind control methods , but we have the choice of whether or not to stay here - if we choose to stay , then we should exercise some loyalty and respect for the Constitution and the laws of the land . However , recognizing our freedoms includes speaking up when things are going wrong and need to be changed - being a true patriot means you want the bad things changed and not for anyone to be stuck with the `` America : love it or leave it '' idiocy .",0

"how can I make my Linksys router encryption work with SBC DSL ? The only way it works now is w/o encryption. ? I 've tried using Linksys ' 64-bit and 128-bit encryption for its wireless router .

Once that is done then your connection should work just fine . Wep is n't the best security but it is a start . If you are going to use it then I would use 128bit and disable broadcast ssid . As for configuring your laptop/pc it depends on if you are using an application or depending on windows to control the wireless card . An external card could be using an application . If it is an internal built in card then more than likely it is being controlled by windows . You can go to your network connections and verify .

"Why Santa Claus is dressed is red ? Santa in his red/white garb was propagated many years before the images produced for Coke.In 1822 , Clement Clarke Moore , an Episcopal minister , wrote a long Christmas poem for his three daughters entitled , `` An Account of a Visit from St . Nicholas . '' Moore 's poem , which he was initially hesitant to publish due to the frivolous nature of its subject , is largely responsible for our modern image of Santa Claus as a `` right jolly old elf '' with a portly figure and the supernatural ability to ascend a chimney with a mere nod of his head ! Although some of Moore 's imagery was probably borrowed from other sources , his poem helped to popularize the now-familiar idea of a Santa Claus who flew from house to house on Christmas Eve—in `` a miniature sleigh '' led by eight flying reindeer , whom he also named—leaving presents for deserving children . `` An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas , '' created a new and immediately popular American icon . In 1881 , political cartoonist Thomas Nast drew on Moore 's poem to create the first likeness that matches our modern image of Santa Claus . His cartoon , which appeared in Harper 's Weekly , depicted Santa as a rotund , cheerful man with a full , white beard , holding a sack laden with toys for lucky children . It is Nast who gave Santa his bright red suit trimmed with white fur , North Pole workshop , elves , and his wife , Mrs. Claus .",0

"What states have no law requiring breaks for workers ? What states , other than Virginia , have no law requiring employers to give rest or meal breaks in an eight-hour workday ? Few states require lunch or rest breaks , if any . I know that for most employees over the age of 18 in even more politically liberal states like New Jersey do not require rest breaks . Of course , many states regulate such for minors , but few for workers over the age of 18.I 've included a link to a Department of Labor chart that gives requirements for each state on meal breaks . It 's a pretty short list : California , Colorado , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Kentucky , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Nebraska , Nevada , New Hampshire , New York , North Dakota , Oregon , Rhode Island , Tennessee , Washington , and West Virginia.For rest breaks , the list shrinks to California , Colorad , Kentucky , Minnesota , Nevada , Oregon , and Washington.Perhaps few regulate is because most employers voluntarily give rest breaks to employees to make work more bearable . Perhaps few regulate because unions , often providing the strongest labor law components in states , do n't really care if non-unionized labor is forced to receive breaks , but really works hard to ensure that its own members are protected through contract agreements and bargaining . Regardless , I hope this information helps .",0

"Is it legal for an employer to dock 30 minutes from your pay for being 1 minute late ? It depends on the state you live in , but most places it would be . You usually have to be paid for all the time you work . He could make you not work for 30 minutes , but if you actually work the 30 minutes , you need to be paid . If you tell us what your state , I could give a more detailed answer.Edit : It is definitely illegal . First , Nevada law says , `` An employer shall pay to the employee wages for each hour the employee works . '' Further , it is illegal to `` Pay a lower wage , salary or compensation to an employee than the amount earned by the employee when the work was performed . '' An employer can change the rate you are paid as a way to punish you , but that requires that they notify you in writing `` Not less than 7 days before the employee performs any work at the decreased wage , salary or compensation . '' Finally , the employer can withold amounts for certain reasons like health insurance and such , but for any other reason , the employee has to voluntarily authorize the deduction in writing . Tell your boss all of this and ask for your back wages in writing . If he refuses , talk to a lawyer.Edit2 : I forgot to add that the regulations specifically say `` An employer may not use a blanket authorization that was made in advance by the employee to withhold any amount from the wages due the employee . '' The employee has to sign the authorization each time .",0

"what do you know about SOURASHTRA ? Sourashtra ( alternate names and spellings : Palkar , Sowrashtra , Saurashtra , Saurashtri , Patnuli ) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in parts of the Southern Indian State of Tamil Nadu . The Ethnologue puts the number of speakers at 310,000 ( 1997 IMA ) , although the actual number could be double this figure or even more.ClassificationSourashtra is a Indo-Aryan language belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family.Geographical DistributionThe speakers of the Sourashtra language , known as Sourashtrians , maintain a predominant presence in Madurai , a city in the southern part of Tamil Nadu . Though official figures are hard to come by , it is believed that the Sourashtra population makes up for about one-third of the city 's total population . They are present in significant numbers in the cities of Dindigul , Paramakudi , Erode , Palani , Rajapalayam , Nilakottai , Salem , Thanjavur , Trichy , Kumbakonam , Thiruvarur and Kottar ( Nagercoil ) . A sizable number is also found in Chennai , Bangalore and other parts of India , but this presence is largely due to small-scale migrations in the last few decades from one of the aforesaid traditional Sourashtrian settlements.It is also believed that Sourashtra speakers exist , albeit in small numbers , in other southern states such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka . However , in the absence of any reliable facts to substantiate this claim , this remains a speculation at best.HistoryThough there is little historical evidence available to support the argument that the Sourashtrians lived in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat in Western India , folklore , and recent linguistic and genetic researches have been able to establish that this region was indeed once the habitat of the Sourashtrians . However , their language has more similarities with Marathi and Konkani , both Indo-Aryan languages of Western India , than it does with Modern Gujarati , the language of present-day Gujarat . Linguists have been able to explain why it is so : Both Sourashtra and Gujarati branched off from a common parent , and have since taken completely different paths to modernity . Gujarati came under the influence of Persian , Arabic , many tribal languages and Hindi , whereas Sourashtra , taking off from Gujarat before it had made any Muslim contact , was influenced by Marathi , Konkani , Kannada , Telugu , and finally , Tamil . It has been acknowledged that Persian and Arabic have had only limited influence on Marathi and Konkani , and this is why they still retain a good amount of vocabulary and grammar derived from Sanskrit , as compared to other daughter languages of Sanskrit . It is possible that the vocabulary and grammar shared between Modern Sourashtra and Marathi is what was originally derived from Sanskrit.The southward flight of the Sourashtrians seems to have been triggered by the frequent Muslim invasions of their homeland and the instability caused by it . No details are available as to whether it was a mass-migration and when it took place . They found the safe haven they were looking for in the Vijayanagar Kingdom , with its capital at Hampi in present-day Karnataka , which was then expanding southwards . They , whose traditional occupation was weaving , were able to impress upon the Emperor with their weaving skills , and soon were elevated to the position of Royal Weavers . Telugu and Kannada were the court languages , though other languages such as Sanskrit and Tamil were also in use . It was during this period that Sourashtra started absorbing Telugu and Kannada words into its lexicon.Vijayanagar rulers had the practice of appointing Governors , known as Nayaks , to manage far-flung regions of the empire . When Madurai and Thanjavur were annexed to the empire , Governors were appointed to administer the new territories . It is believed that a part of the Sourashtra community moved to Madurai and Thanjavur to serve the Governors . ****Hey why di they suspend you from yahoo*****",0
"what happen to a chicken egg in water vs a chicken egg in vinegar and why ? Several things can happen . Soaked in vinegar for several hours , the shell becomes pliable from decalcification , allowing you to insert it in a narrow necked bottle.When boiling eggs , adding vinegar to the water will coagulate ( denature ) the albumin if the eggshell cracks , preventing it from creating egg drop soup.And as vinegar has a higher density than watr , eggs will float more easily , expeially if the eggs are stale .",0

"I can understand people not believing in God and Christianity or any other religion , but why insult it ? Why is it ok to curse , be mean to people , talk about and exploit sex , etc . in public and everywhere you go , but if you speak of God , Pray , or wear clothing with scriptures or anything like that you are offending people ? Even if you do n't believe in God and religion , look at the people who truly do believe and live their lives by the Word . Look at how they act . They are kind , caring , respectful and they donate money to charities and volunteer for things . So whether or not you think God is real , the people who do have become better people because of their belief . So in my mind 's eye , those who believe with their heart and confess with their mouth Jesus is indeeed our Saviour are 1 : If it 's all real then they are going to spend eternity with the Father 2 : Either way they are really good people.As for me I believe without a doubt but I struggle with living right . I have had a few experiences that made my belief stronger than ever . I still have to work on how I lead my life . Let 's face it -- it 's easier to insult or make fun of believers than to put that mantle on.You know what it 's like -- it 's not called `` the straight and narrow '' for nothing . I would n't say it 's true for all , but for many it 's just a case of not seeing any kind of benefit -- material , I 'm pretty sure -- to justify their committiment of time , let alone sacrifice.Why do you think so many people question God 's lack of intervention in natural disasters or tragic deaths ? These people all think it 's some kind of cause/effect relationship . You screw up -- God bails you out . If things go wrong , there ca n't be a God -- otherwise He 'd have stopped it.So many of these people are just jaded from the bombardment of so much content that they absorb -- TV , movies , the Internet . There 's plenty of crap to catch hold of , I have no doubt.They 're just so busy trying to disprove our beliefs they ca n't bother seeing the kinds of people they insult . As far as that goes , most of these folks see Christians as one big happy Pat Robertson family . Unfortunately , those that speak the loudest get the most attentio.I always figure every post from one of these folks is just another opportunity for me to witness . Maybe 99 times I 'll just be wasting my time . But who knows about the other 1 ? None of us are perfect , but you are certainly walking the right path . Let these lost souls both strengthen your faith and provide you a powerful incentive to keep witnessing God 's love and Jesus ' sacrifice for our sins . Go in peace and go with God.While I stand behind all the words I wrote above , I felt I had to add to this post in reaction to your additonal comments about prayer in school . I do n't know exactly what the context is , but I find it very troubling . As a Christian , I believe prayer to be the most direct link I have with God . But the notion that prayer should somehow be forced upon students or encouraged in a public school is not just unconstitutional but morally repugnant to me . Even voluntary prayer is patently coersive in my opinion . I think you are a well-meaning but misguided person who does need to work more on how you lead your life . A little bit more tolerance for those who do n't share your beliefs would be as welcome as others ' tolerance for yours .",0

"how dies gravity really work ? Just to expand on the answer by `` twertyto '' , the answer to your question is `` We do n't know yet '' . This is one of the major questions in physics right now . There are some ideas but none of them have been proven either mathematically or in laboratory experiment . It is believed by most leading minds in physics that once we learn the exact relationship between gravity and the other known forces ( electromagnetic , strong nuclear and weak nuclear ) , we will then understand how gravity works . To understand this relationship will take what is called the `` grand unified theory '' , which is not yet a theory at all but a hoped-for theory to be developed in the near future . The `` grand unified theory '' would explain how gravity is related to mass and energy and the `` known forces '' mentioned above , and would do for gravity what Einstein 's `` E=MC2 '' ( relativity ) did for understanding the relationship between mass and energy . ( Some quick background : E=MC2 explained the exact relationship between mass and energy , showing they are both different aspects of the same thing , and can therefore be converted into each other ) . To sum this up in a simple fashion : scientists believe that gravity , energy , mass and even time are all made of the same `` stuff '' at some super-fundamental level , but they have n't yet figured out this fundamental level . Once someone does ( which would pretty much be a guaranteed Nobel prize ) , we will know how gravity works . Until then , we can only speculate .",0

"This is question for science lovers ? If you dig a hole right through the earth along its diameter & drop a ball in the hole , what will be the motion shown by the ball ? This could not be done on earth because of its liquid core , but perhaps it could be done on the solid moon.At the surface of the earth , a ball ( let 's say of lead ) would have a potential energy ( PE - energy of position ) relative to the center of gravity at the center of the earth . As the ball is released into the theoretical hole , it would accelerate ( like dropping it into a well ) and some of the PE would be converted to kinetic energy ( KE - energy of motion ) . Because energy can neither be created nor destroyed , as the ball drops its speed increases and it has more KE but less PE . The ball will continue to accelerate until it reaches the center of the earth but with less attraction from the earth 's gravitational field because more and more of the earth 's mass is now above ( or behind ) it . At the very center of the earth the ball would have maximum KE but minimum PE . Passing the center the process is reversed and the ball slows as it reaches the other side of the earth 's surface , all the while reconverting KE to PE . At the opposite surface the ball would have maximum PE ( equal to the original PE but of opposite sign ( say - instead of + ) .The process could repeat forever if there is no wind resistance ( perfect vacuum - like on the moon ) and the hole was perfectly smooth exerting no friction as the earth spins on its axis constantly touching the ball to the sides of the hole.Of course this must be a mental exercise ; but it is an interesting demonstration of physics and energy conversion in particular . Good luck .",0

"what is a good homemade remedy for constipation ? Folks , do you know how NASTY prune juice is ? *shudder*Prunes do work ( and prune juice , if you 're a taste bud masochist ) ; however , they work by a chemical laxative - it 's a natural chemical , but you do n't want to take any chemical inducement on a regular basis , even if it comes from a tree and not from a test tube.If this is a one time thing , it does n't matter really whether you take ex-lax or prunes , they will both work.However , if you have constipation fairly often , it 's going to be more of a management thing than a quick fix sort of thing . At that means adding fiber to your diet . Still , you do n't need to take metamucil every night . First , eat the most whole grain bread you like . For some people , switching from white to whole grain bread may be all you need.Here are some other good sources : Fruits and veggies - the crunchier the better . Apples are especially good , as are whole oranges . ( And cooking does n't destroy fiber , so it only needs to be crunchy in its raw state.Oatmeal , brown rice , and other whole grain cereals and grains . And anything made with these.Citrus marmalades ! Citrus skin is an excellent source of both vitamin C and fiber.Dried fruit . Raisins are good , without the er , immediacy that prunes can incur.So , metamucil , apple , or oatmeal raisin cookie with diced orange peel .",0

"Getting started as a Financial Analyst ? I have a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and have over 5 years of experience in the field . Unfortunately I 've decided that it 's not my cup of tea and I have recently looked into switching careers.I 've always been an analytical and thorough person so I feel a career as a financial analyst in a corporate setting ( as opposed to an investment bank ) would suit me well . I 've already taken about 6 accounting classes and have gotten A 's in all of my classes . The only problem is , I do n't know where to get started . What 's the best way into the position ? My options at the moment are : * Get an Associates Degree in Accounting* Get a second Bachelors Degree in Accounting/Finance* Get a Masters Degree in Accounting* Take the CPA exam w/o the required work experienceOut of all of these options , what 's the best choice in getting hired ? I believe your best option is to obtain your bachelors degree in accounting/finance . Inherently , this is a more attractive degree due to the amount of education obtained . Furthermore , any respectable company will require a bachelors degree for a financial analyst position.While the other two options are not bad , they will not help you greatly so I would do them only if it is in addition to the second bachelors degree . Passing the CPA exam without the work experience will not obtain you your certification , which is the true `` resume value '' so you would have only passed a test and would have an interest dinner conversation piece at best.The masters degree in accounting is also nice as a supplement to your bachelors degree , but entirely unnecessary . Most firms/corporations you talk with are not interested in a graduate degree unless it is specifically applicable to the position , which for a financial analyst position it is not . Those are just my thoughts.. : - )",0

"why are banks for coins called piggy banks ? In Middle English , `` pygg '' referred to a type of clay used for making various household objects such as jars . People often saved money in kitchen pots and jars made of pygg , called `` pygg jars '' . By the 18th Century , the spelling of `` pygg '' had changed and the term `` pygg jar '' had evolved to `` pig bank . '' This name may have caught on because the pig banks were mostly used by children , and the pig is a child-friendly shape that is easy to fashion out of clay . The actual origin of the name bears no relation to the pig itself.What also helped to start the change from jar to pig was during the 18th century , an order of 200 `` pygg '' jars was sent for by a shop owner . The person on the receiving end of this letter did not understand and hand crafted 200 coin holders that were shaped like pigs . When this order was received they were shelved and sold very quickly . The new pig shaped coin holder became popular . Once the shop had run out of stock , they sent off for more pig-shaped coin holders .",0

"teenage drinking has become a problem in our society why ? Teenage Drinking has been a problem since the begining of the production of alcholic beverages.It is considered a rite of passage to consume alcohol . Our social mores consider `` drinking '' a rite of passage . Peer pressure , media , and the acceptance sitgma that it 's OK to Drink are all around us.The problem will only be solved with Education , and a society that frounds upon the problem . A control over the Media and advertisment will also be needed . Much Like the ban on smoking , a campaign is needed to reach this eventual goal . Smoking negative media , and the ban on certain advertisement had reduced some of the smoking is cool attitude . The same needs to be applied to the alcohol industry .

"What is the best diet pill for weight loss ? Good question . I will answer by first saying that diet pills are a fraud . Any pill that says you can lose weight by taking it and doing nothing else is wrong.Losing weight is not losing weight if you put it back on . That ’ s what diet pills do , why do you think there is a new popular one every few months.Now if you wonder if there are any good supplements and my answer is yes.There are some supplements that you can take that can enhance a very healthy diet and fitness program and help you to stay committed to it . 7 Keto is an awesome metabolic enhancing compound that helps to reduce body weight and body fat by giving you more of a hormone that tells your thyroid to increase your metabolism . You may say wow , that ’ s what I need . No , the 7-Keto is all you need , not the other stuff . Yes but no , see the body can only take so much of it at a time before its eliminated by the blood and the rest becomes expensive urine . So you cant just take it alone , it must be part of a plan.Hoodia appears to affect the brain by making the stomach feel full and reducing the desire to eat . Offers safe , caffeine-free , non-stimulant weight management support . It also may help in metabolizing fats.Multivitamins - help you maintain the muscle that you have by providing nutrients your cells need . Understand if you don ’ t put enough nutrients in your body , you will lose muscle because your body will eat the muscle for those nutrients.These supplements should be part of an overall lifestyle change , to a healthier one.There are 5 most important things that must go together in any workout program . These are part of changing your complete lifestyle to one that is healthier . They also help you to naturally optimize your metabolism . The faster your metabolism the better your body uses your food for energy , instead of storing it as fat . I put them in the order of importance.1 . Eat more . Yes eat more . More meals that is . It is best to eat a small meal every 3-4 hours . The meal should be just large enough to where you are not hungry , as opposed to eating you are full . There is a difference . Eating 1 or 2 meals a day slows your metabolism down . You should have at least 4-6 meals a day . For most people , your food should be balanced between carbs proteins and fats in a 50-25-25 ratio . Throughout your day you should maintain this ratio 2 . Drink more water . Most of us don ’ t have enough water . This means our bodies are dehydrated . Two things a dehydrated body has trouble doing , one is releasing water . In order to lose fat you must be able to release water , because fat cells in your body are composed of mostly water . A dehydrated body can not build very well . Muscle tone indicates a constant building state in your body . If your body isn ’ t building that means it is losing muscle and it ’ s never good to lose muscle that slows your metabolism and makes you look flabby.3 . Maintain a balanced workout regimen of cardio and resistance ( weights ) . Cardio is good for fat burning and it ’ s easy to do and to progress yourself . Resistance is a little harder because it ’ s not as easy to know what to do . If weights aren ’ t your thing then try Yoga or Pilates . Both are very effective resistance and core training and can help you maintain lean muscle and increase your overall metabolism.4 . Smart supplementation of your diet is your best solution to making sure you get the nutrients your food doesn ’ t give you . I mentioned 7-Keto , Hoodia , and a multivitamin plus cleanse formulas , as well as detox formulas are awesome for eliminating toxins we take into our bodies without knowing.5 . Sleep is a very important part of any healthy lifestyle regimen . When we sleep our bodies and minds refresh themselves and allow us to function at an optimal level . Sleeping allows muscles to rebuild themselves and when they do that , it speeds your metabolism.You may ask why I gave you this long list instead of just telling you what exercises",0

"Is it common for the surgical pen ( attatched to a broken leg ) to poke thru the skin ?

How common is it for it to shift up and actually pierce thru the skin ? Does this happen often in the mediacl industry , in humans or animals ? What could have caused it ? It can . Some procedures ( with humans ) require either external braces that are acually attatched to the bone via pins and screws . Some are temporary screws that are left sticking out of the bone that eventually may protrude through the skin . The doctors do n't make them flush with the surface of the bone because that makes it easier to remove them . However , the inside of bones is sterile .

"What is the differance between devil worshipping and satanism ? Satanism is a religious , semi-religious and/or philosophical movement whose adherents recognize Satan as an archetype , pre-cosmic force , or some aspect of human nature . Although named for Satan , a name associated with evil and temptation , Satanism is more commonly the name given to certain spiritual paths which emphasize the Left-Hand Path , as opposed to the much more common Right-Hand Path . Left-Handers believe in spiritual enrichment through their own work on themselves , and that ultimately they are answerable only to themselves , while Right-Handers believe in spiritual enrichment through the dissolution or submission of the self to ( or into ) something greater . Many Satanists do not in fact worship a deity called Satan , or necessarily any other deity , nor do they follow a principle of evil . This aspect of their beliefs is very commonly misunderstood.This is very different to people who worship Satan , these are usually emotionally immature people , because obviously satan does n't want to be worshipped by the creatures he despises .",0

"A child is suffereing from cardiac myopathy and she is given 24 hours medicne injected ( connected to machine ) D Doctors suggest she can live only with support of medicines . Is that true . Is there any other solution . she is only 1 year old . So surgery is not possible.Is there any cure for such patients how long they can survive , can they live without medicine . plesase advice Cardiomyopathy is a chronic and sometimes progressive disease in which the heart muscle ( myocardium ) , is abnormally enlarged , thickened and/or stiffened . The condition typically begins in the walls of the heart 's lower chambers ( ventricles ) , and in more severe cases also affects the walls of the upper chambers ( atria ) . The actual muscle cells as well as the surrounding tissues of the heart become damaged . Eventually , the weakened heart loses the ability to pump blood effectively and heart failure or irregular heartbeats ( arrhythmias or dysrhythmia ) may occur . The medication that she is being given is probably being used to help the heart contract or function better . The medication being given by machine is just to make sure it is n't given too quickly because of how small your child is.It is likely she will need some sort of medication the rest of her life . If she is a candidate for a heart transplant , she will still need to be on some sort of medication the rest of her life.You need to speak to your daughters Pediatrian or Cardiac Doctor if you have questions .

"what is the best way to get money for college ? The first thing you need to know about money for college is that there are two kinds . Free and not free . In other words there are loans and scholarships . You want scholarships first and whatever is n't paid for by those can be covered with loans . To get scholarships some people think you have to be a `` straight A '' student or an exceptional athlete . Although those things do help , they are n't always necessary . You may have certain unique talents and abilities that can earn you scholarships regardless of your grades . Try visiting www.fastweb.com . You can use this site to make a profile and they will e-mail you scholarship opportunities that apply specifically to you ! Two kids from my high school won a scholarship for making their prom outfits out of duct tape ! True story ! Not all of the scholarships are that crazy but again , they do n't necessarily relate to grades or sports . If you do have good grades and/or play sports ; great ! Use that in your profile and they will send you opportunities that apply directly to your talents . It is totally free and there is no limit as to how many scholarships you can apply for and even win . So try to pay for everything you can with scholarships and then you may need to fill in some gaps with loans . Your next stop : www.fasfa.com . There you will apply for financial aid . You will need your most recent W-2 and your parents help when you apply . If you do n't have parents or you are over 24 years of age you get to skip the parent section . This site may reward you with some scholarships as well but it 's usually mostly government loans . That is why I would suggest applying for dozens of scholarships first . Good luck finding the money and good luck once you start school . Remember ; for every hour spent in class you should spend two hours studying !",0

"any lawers in here ? My husband had lukemia when he was little . His father worked at a papermill . I have done research on the papermill and they do have benzene products . I know that it is possible for benzene to cling to clothing and induce lukemia . The problem is his lukemia has been gone for 20+ years and the statute of limitations apply . He has not been in for a check up nor has he ask a health professional if this could be possible . If he gets documentation stateing that it was indeed possible that the exposure may have caused his lukemia , could we sue for `` delayed discovery ? '' Sometimes the accrual of a cause of action in tort is delayed until the plaintiff discovered ( or reasonably should have discovered or suspected ) the factual basis for his or her claim . The discovery rule most frequently applies when it is particularly difficult for the plaintiff to observe or understand the breach of duty , or when the injury itself ( or its cause ) is hidden or beyond what the ordinary person could be expected to understand.Unfortunately , you did not specify where you live . Statutes and case law vary by , so there may literally be 50 different ways to answer your question . There might even be federal laws that apply .

"what is PCOS ? It has something to do with ovulation and overweight women , but I do n't know what exactly it is . Polycystic Ovary SyndromeWhat is polycystic ovary syndrome ? Who gets it ? If your hormones do n't work in the normal way , your ovaries might make too many eggs . Those eggs turn into many cysts . The cysts ( say : `` sists '' ) are like little balloons filled with liquid.Polycystic ovary syndrome is called PCOS for short . Women in their childbearing years can get it . It often begins in the teenage years . It does n't go away.What are the signs of PCOS ? Usually , women with PCOS have irregular menstrual periods . After a while , some women stop having any periods . Women with PCOS may have trouble getting pregnant.About 70 percent of women with PCOS have extra hair growing in the sideburn area of their face and on their chin , upper lip , nipple area , chest , lower abdomen and thighs . They may get acne . About half are obese . Some women with PCOS have no signs of it.What causes PCOS ? Doctors do n't know what causes PCOS . If you have PCOS , you may have a problem with the way your body uses blood sugar ( glucose ) . Because of this problem , the hormones that control your ovaries and menstrual periods can become abnormal.Does PCOS cause long-term problems ? If you have PCOS , you are more likely to get high blood pressure or diabetes . This means you have a greater risk for strokes and heart attacks.Because of irregular menstrual periods , women with PCOS are more likely to be infertile ( unable to get pregnant ) . They may also have a higher risk for cancer of the uterus or breast.How can my doctor tell that I have PCOS ? Your doctor will look for the signs of PCOS . Blood tests that measure your hormone levels can help . An ultrasound exam can show if you have cysts on your ovaries.How is PCOS treated ? If you have PCOS , you might need to lose weight . Medicine can help with your menstrual cycle , abnormal hair growth and acne . If you have diabetes or high blood pressure , they have to be treated . If you want to have a baby , there are medicines that may help you get pregnant .",0

"What exactly is antimatter ? Howmuch of it has been produced till today ? Antimatter or contra-terrene matter is matter that is composed of the antiparticles of those that constitute normal matter . If a particle and its antiparticle come in contact with each other , the two annihilate and produce a burst of energy , which results in the production of other particles and antiparticles or electromagnetic radiation . In these reactions , rest mass is not conserved , although ( as in any other reaction ) energy ( E=mc² ) is conserved.Scientists in 1995 succeeded in producing antiatoms of hydrogen , and also antideuteron nuclei , made out of an antiproton and an antineutron , but no antiatom more complex than antideuterium has been created yet . In principle , antiatoms of any element could be built from readily available sources of antiparticles . Such antiatoms would have exactly the same properties as their normal-matter counterparts . The production of antielements in bulk quantities seems unlikely to ever become achievable , however.Positrons and antiprotons can individually be stored in a device called a Penning trap , which uses a combination of magnetic field and electric fields to hold charged particles in a vacuum . Two international collaborations , ATRAP and ATHENA , used these devices to store thousands of slowly moving antihydrogen atoms in 2002 . It is the goal of these collaborations to probe the energy level structure of antihydrogen to compare it with that of hydrogen as a test of the CPT theorem . One way to do this is to confine the antiatoms in an inhomogenous magnetic field ( one can not use electric fields since the antiatoms are neutral ) and interrogate them with lasers . If the anti-atoms have too much kinetic energy they will be able to escape the magnetic trap , and it is therefore essential that the anti-atoms be produced with as little energy as possible . This is the key difference between the antihydrogen that ATRAP and ATHENA produced , which was made at very low temperatures , and the antihydrogen produced in 1995 which was moving at a speed close to the speed of light.Antimatter/matter reactions have practical applications in medical imaging , such as positron emission tomography ( PET ) . In some kinds of beta decay , a nuclide loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron ( in the same event , a proton becomes a neutron , and neutrinos are also given off ) . Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a cyclotron and are widely generated for medical use.Antiparticles are created everywhere in the universe where high-energy particle collisions take place , such as in the center of our galaxy , but none has been detected that is residual from the Big Bang , as most normal matter is . [ 1 ] The unequal distribution between matter and antimatter in the universe has long been a mystery . The solution likely lies in the violation of CP-symmetry by the laws of nature ; see baryogenesis.how much produced it is on and on and on",0

"Alabama and education for children with pdd-nos / Autism ? I assume you are asking about what education is available for children with the disorder in Alabama . I am not familiar with Alabama 's resources but as a parent of a profoundly mentally challenged child , I will tell you what I do know . The best place to start is ask your pediatrician about resources . The mental health facility is a very good place to start . Depending on the child 's age , your area may have something available like First Steps , which is an early intervention service for children with developmental delays available for children up to 3 years old . First Steps was wonderful for my daughter . After she turned 3 , we were referred to a state-run facility that basically gave us a case manager and helped to identify the special needs for our child but after 3 years with them , we still have not been able to actually RECEIVE services because the waiting list is so long , then they go through freezes . I hope your state is not as backed up as ours is . As far as education , public schools are required to provide an education to special needs children , per the Americans with Disabilities Act . The special needs child is given an IEP ( individualed education plan ) so that the child is taught what is appropriate for his/her abilities . The parent 's involvement and input in the IEP is very important . If you do not agree with the IEP , you can change it . Individuals with Disabilities Education Act : The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) ( formerly called P.L . 94-142 or the Education for all Handicapped Children Act of 1975 ) requires public schools to make available to all eligible children with disabilities a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment appropriate to their individual needs.IDEA requires public school systems to develop appropriate Individualized Education Programs ( IEP 's ) for each child . The specific special education and related services outlined in each IEP reflect the individualized needs of each student.IDEA also mandates that particular procedures be followed in the development of the IEP . Each student 's IEP must be developed by a team of knowledgeable persons and must be at least reviewed annually . The team includes the child 's teacher ; the parents , subject to certain limited exceptions ; the child , if determined appropriate ; an agency representative who is qualified to provide or supervise the provision of special education ; and other individuals at the parents ' or agency 's discretion.If parents disagree with the proposed IEP , they can request a due process hearing and a review from the State educational agency if applicable in that state . They also can appeal the State agency 's decision to State or Federal court . For more information , contact : Office of Special Education ProgramsOffice of Special Education and Rehabilitative ServicesU.S . Department of Education400 Maryland Avenue , S.W.Washington , D.C. 20202-7100I hope this helps . I know how hard it is with a special needs child and I wish you the best .

"Are there any plutonium compounds ? Plutonium reacts readily with oxygen , forming PuO and PuO2 , as well as intermediate oxides . It reacts with the halides , giving rise to compounds such as PuX3 where X can be F , Cl , Br or I ; PuF4 is also seen . The following oxyhalides are observed : PuOCl , PuOBr and PuOI . It will react with carbon to form PuC , nitrogen to form PuN and silicon to form PuSi2.Plutonium like other actinides readily forms a dioxide plutonyl core ( PuO2 ) . In the environment , this plutonyl core readily complexes with carbonate as well as other oxygen moeities ( OH- , NO2- , NO3- , and SO4-2 ) to form charged complexes which can be readily mobile with low affinities to soil . * PuO2 ( CO3 ) 1-2 * PuO2 ( CO3 ) 2-4 * PuO2 ( CO3 ) 3-6PuO2 formed from neutralizing highly acidic nitric acid solutions tends to form polymeric PuO2 which is resistant to complexation .

"who is guru ? The syllable gu means shadowsThe syllable ru , he who disperses them , Because of the power to disperse darknessthe guru is thus named.A guru ( गुरू Sanskrit ) is a teacher in Hinduism , Buddhism or Sikhism . Based on a long line of philosophical understanding as to the importance of knowledge , the guru is seen in these religions as a sacred conduit , or a way to self-realization . In India and among people of Hindu , Buddhist , or Sikh belief , the title retains a hallowed meaning.Guru also refers in Sanskrit to Brihaspati , a Hindu figure analogous to the Roman planet/god Jupiter . In Vedic astrology , Jupiter/Guru/Brihaspati is believed to exert teaching influences . Indeed , in many Indian languages , such as Hindi , the occidental Thursday is called either Brihaspativaar or Guruvaar ( vaar meaning period or day ) .In contemporary India and Indonesia , Guru is widely used within the general meaning of `` teacher '' . In Western usage , the original meaning of guru has been extended to cover anyone who acquires followers , though not necessarily in an established school of philosophy or religion . In a further metaphorical extension , guru is used to refer to a person who has authority because of his or her perceived knowledge or skills in a domain of expertise.The importance of discerning between a true guru and a false one is explored in scriptures and teachings of religions in which a guru plays a role . The assessment and criticism of gurus and the Guru-shishya tradition are espoused in the discourse about cults and new religious movements by Western secular scholars , theologians , anti-cultists and by skeptics both in the West and in India .",0

I am a young actor as well . I highly recommend reading AUDITION by Michael Shurtleff . 1 . Speak at a good pace and be LOUD ( little to no chance of landing the part if they ca n't hear you ) 2 . Do n't memorize anything unless you have to . It will not impress the person casting if you can memorize something . Memorizing unnecessarily wastes energy on remembering when it could be used towards acting.3 . Be respectful and attentive to the auditor but DO NOT MAKE SMALL TALK WITH THE AUDITOR . They are there to work.4 . Get familiar with the play so you can be more prepared to accuratly portray your piece . 5 . Practice , Practice , Practice . Practice in front of people ( and get feedback ) , practice to a mirror.6 . If memorization is necessary , memorize it like the back of your hand . Once you get on stage and the adrenaline starts pumping , it 's easier to forget.7 . RELAX , the auditor is not out to get you .",0

"Does the sun really set when we see it disappear in the horizon or before ? My question is about optics . The short answer is : Yes.I think the previous people who attempted to answer this question did not read it carefully . The atmosphere is in layers , of different densities , that refract the sunlight and different colors different amounts . The light is bent downwards because the speed of light in the upper layers is greater than the speed of light in the layers closer to the ground . One can see this effect in the change in shape of the sun as it sets , and the effects like disconnected pieces of sun , green flashes , etc . This is just the same as the effect that creates mirages , or the spurious images of water on or above dry roads in the heat . So it is definitely true , that the sun has already gone below the horizon , when we still view its image .",0

"did rachel carson work with animals ? if so what kind ? NAME : Rachel Carson BIRTHDATE : May 27 , 1907 BIRTHPLACE : Springdale , PA EDUCATION : 1925- entered Pennsylvania College for Women ( now Chatham College ) 1929- graduated with honors , earning a scholarship to continue her studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , MD . 1932- M.A . in Zoology from John Hopkins University . FAMILY BACKGROUND : The youngest of three children , Rachel Carson had a rugged upbringing in a simple farmhouse outside the western Pennsylvania river town of Springdale . She credited her mother with introducing her to the world of nature that became her lifelong passion . DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS : After completing her education , Carson joined the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries as the writer of a radio show entitled `` Romance Under the Waters , '' in which she was able to explore life under the seas and bring it to listeners . In 1936 , after being the first woman to take and pass the civil service test , the Bureau of Fisheries hired her as a full-time junior biologist , and over the next 15 years , she rose in the ranks until she was the chief editor of all publications for the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service . During the 1940s , Carson began to write books on her observations of life under the sea , a world as yet unknown to the majority of people . She resigned from her government position in 1952 in order to devote all her time to writing . The idea for her most famous book , Silent Spring , emerged , and she began writing it in 1957 . It was published in 1962 , and influenced President Kennedy , who had read it , to call for testing of the chemicals mentioned in the book . Carson has been called the mother of the modern environmental movement . DATE OF DEATH : April 14 , 1964 PLACE OF DEATH : Her home in Silver Spring , MD PORTRAYED BY : Celeste Earhart WEB SITES : Rachel Carson Homestead Rachel Carson Council Rachel Carson National Wildlife RefugeRachel Carson Forum - a center for `` new ideas and opinions about environmental issues facing Pennsylvania .

"How does temperature affect the taste of food and drink ? For example , white wine , tap water , Cointreau , lager and even chocolate taste much better cold . On the other hand , tea , coffee and brandy , as well as most cooked meals , taste much better warm or hot . English beer and red wine are better at room or cellar temperature . Why ? Heat amplifies smell , and most of `` taste '' is actually based on smell . Without smell , coffee and chocolate would just be bitter anf gross . So aromatic things smell more strongly . Cold also delays the taste of things , so cold chocolate probably loses enough of the bitterness by being cold , while retaining enough aroma , such that that might make it better . Of course , if you like your chocolate bitter ( like I do ) you wo n't prefer it cold for taste reasons . I think cold chocolate -- especially dark chocolate -- is too tasteless.Occasionally there is a matter of texture as well . With chocolate , for instance , I 'd dispute that it tastes better cold , but it is certainly less melty . With beer/lager/ale , heat can make it go flat , which affects its taste , but with liquor , the intense burn of the alcohol makes the burn worse . Aromatic liquors like brandy/cognac and whiskey/scotch are heated to allow the aromas to be stronger , but really , most all alcohol is innately gross , and is an acquired taste -- so people tend to learn to like them in particular ways , but I do n't think any of it is particularly innate . Cognac , scotch , and fine wine all take years to `` learn '' to appreciate .",0

This also makes any offspring of her brother pauls her niece or nephew ( obviously ) . Jane is marys sister and so the same is true , she will be aunt to any of marys offspring hence we have the relationship Aunt and niece for both children to each other . They are also however the grandchildren of each couple . Jane is the grandchild of Mary and John and sally is the grandchild of Betty and paul and since the only relationship I can think of between grandchildren normally is cousins I think this term applies here as well .",0

"What is Raggaetone ? Reggaeton is a form of dance music which has become popular with Latin America in youth during the late 1990s and has spread to North American and European audiences during the first few years of the 21st century . Reggaeton ( also spelled with the Spanish accent as Reggaetón , and sometimes as Reguetón in Spanish ) - blends Jamaican music influences of reggae and dancehall with those of Latin America , such as bomba and plena , as well as that of hip hop . The music is combined with rapping ( generally ) in Spanish . Reggaeton has empowered the Spanish Caribbean youth , specifically those of Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic , as well as the Latin American and United States Latino communities , with a musical genre as a voice . More recently it has become an international movement with the help of many from New York 's Latino and Black hip hop community.While it takes influences from hip hop and dancehall , it would be wrong to define reggaeton as the 'Spanish'- or 'Latino'- version of either of these genres ; reggaeton has its own specific beat and rhythm , whereas Latino hip hop is simply hip hop sung by artists of Latino descent . Reggaeton 's distinguishing feature is the Dem Bow beat ( alternately spelled Dembow ) , which originated in a song by Shabba Ranks in the mid-1990s.Reggaeton lyrics tend to be more derived from hip hop than dancehall . Like hip hop , reggaeton has caused controversy due to its often explicit lyrics and alleged exploitation of women [ 1 ] . Further controversy surrounds perreo , a dance with explicit sexual overtones which typically accompanies reggaeton music",0

"Are there any tried and true ways to stop psoriasis flare ups ? Keep your skin moist and lubricated . Avoid cold , dry climates . Cold weather may worsen symptoms , while hot , humid weather and sunlight may improve symptoms . ( However , hot humid weather may worsen certain types of psoriasis . ) Avoid scratching and picking skin and skin injuries ( cuts or scrapes ) . An injury to the skin can cause psoriasis patches to form anywhere on the body , including the site of the injury . This includes injuries to your nails or nearby skin while trimming your nails . Avoid stress and anxiety . Stress may cause psoriasis to appear suddenly ( flare ) or can make symptoms worse , although this has not been proven in studies . Avoid infection . Infections such as strep throat can cause psoriasis to appear suddenly ( called guttate psoriasis ) , especially in children . Try to avoid certain medications . Some , including beta-blockers and lithium , have been found to worsen psoriasis symptoms . Tell your doctor you have psoriasis before any medications are prescribed for you . Limit alcohol . This may help control psoriasis , especially for men .",0

"Does anyone really believe that there is intelligent life out there ? And do you believe they have visited the earth before ? If so how could they get here , it being so many light years to the nearest star that may have planets ? there is a pretty convincing argument based on statistics , but that depends largely upon the assumptions one makes . it is called the drake equation : Nc = N * fp * ne * fl * fi * fc * fLwhereN represents the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy fp is the fraction of stars that have planets around them ne is the number of planets per star that are capable of sustaining life fl is the fraction of planets in ne where life evolves fi is the fraction of fl where intelligent life evolves fc is the fraction of fi that communicate fL is fraction of the planet 's life during which the communicating civilizations liveandNc represents the number of communicating civilizationsi snagged this from this page : http : //www.activemind.com/Mysterious/Topics/SETI/drake_equation.htmlwhich explains what some reasonable estimates for these values are , and includes a little javascript calculator thingy so you can plug in your own values.if you use their estimates , the final result is that there should be around 1000 civilizations capable of communicating in the galaxy.however a lot of this hinges on the value of fl , which is the fraction of planets capable of supporting life where life actually evolves . since we have no evidence to support any value for this parameter at all , it 's all pretty moot.however , we have only just begun started exploring our own solar system , and there have been possible ( though not conclusive ) signs of life even the next planet over , on mars . only time will tell , i suppose .",0
"Although we see with two eyes a given object we see only one image.Why not two ? Although we see with two eyes , each of which creates its own , slightly different image , we normally have single vision , meaning we see only one image of an object . This is because your brain can normally control the muscles that move each eye carefully so that both are pointing accurately at the object you are looking at . When each eye produces its own image , your brain then joins them together into one . This gives us what is called ‘ single binocular vision ’ .Double vision can be an effect that you can create yourself . For example , if you hold your finger in front of your eyes and then look past it into the distance , you will experience double vision . This is normal .",0

"If satan had appeared as a man instead of a serpent , would Eve had said `` No-way '' ?

Then when I heard one suggested interpretation of Gen 3:16 `` ... Your desire will be for your husband '' to mean to attack or desire his leadership , I thought perhaps the desire would have been there at the fall , ( since Adam 's pass-through instruction of God 's command was ultimately ignored ) and had satan appeared as a man , would she have rejected his recommendation , much like today ? Thoughts ? What a good question . I have now idea . Maybe ( since i am a woman , i should know ) she might have because we women really like to talk . We could talk to a tree if we needed to .

Some bacteria DNA or RNA more closely resembles that of mitochondrion.Proper cleavage of the genetic material , followed by TLC or possibly paper chromatography , could show the similarities or differences .

"Where is the gum ? I was told that my gum is healthy if I can see less than 4mm of it . But I thought the gum is the flesh connecting the teeth to the jaw , and I can see the entire pink flesh covering my teeth . There must be at least 1.5cm . How can it be less than 4mm ? Am I missing something ? The 4 mm probably refers to the depth of your gum pockets ( the space betwen the top of your gums to the alveolar bone that holds your teeth . Your dentist would measure this with a probe.If your pockets are deeper than 4 mm then it means that you have had bone loss which is usually caused by periodontal disease ( an infection in the gums ) . The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly ( brush at least twice a day for two minutes ) . I emphasize flossing , because often people do n't realize just how important it is . The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck , and therefore where bacteria sticks most often , too . The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch . So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth , you want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure you remove the plaque . So you should be going up and down two to three times along the tooth on both sides of the contact.Hope this helps !",0

"Does anyone Really believe that a `` terrorist '' would stand and fight in Iraq ? How could anyone think a Terrorist would face a U. S. A . Marine in Iraq. ? That makes no sense . Terrorist are cowards . They do the dirty work behind your back not face to face . The biggest problem in Nam that got our boys killed was not knowing friend from foe . Iraq is no different than Nam . Iraq is now in Cival War for Control of the oil money . Greed is at work . Yes , I do . Do n't forget that these terrorists are raised from birth to hate westerners in general and Americans in particular . They are shown videos of Americans dying from a very young age in the madrassas . They are conditioned to believe that if you die in jihad , it is an instant ticket to heaven.Now what I am going to say next may seem a bit offensive to Americans , but it is not meant to be . In order to beat the terrorists , we have to start understanding them ... we have to start thinking like them . To a terrorist , conducting warfare as they do is not cowardly . It is cowardly by western standards , but not by eastern standards . Terror has been a part of Asian warfare for thousands of years . And this is not the first time Americans have seen these tactics . The Viet Cong used them first against France and then against the United States to beat both countries . Suicide bombers , roadside bombs , combatants dresses as civilians ... talk to any Viet Nam combat vet and they will tell you.And do n't forget this , either : Back in the 1770s , our Founding Fathers were considered terrorists .

"How do I fix my mouse ? I have an Apple Mighty Mouse . It just recently ( 45 seconds ago ) stopped scrolling . The scroll ball moves but the screen doesnt scroll .

In Hydrogen , the electron can be thought of as having a velocity of c/137 ( the speed of light times the fine structure constant ) .

"Why are honey bees appearing outside at night , in the dark and cold ? Today is ( was ) December 23 . For the past week or so , I 've been finding honey bees outside my front door after sunset . I 'm in the Phoenix metro area , so it 's not freezing cold , but cool enough to kill these poor guys . I never see them during the day and I have nothing on or around my door to attract them . I thought bees did n't fly at night , but apparently they do . Anyway , I was out on my front patio until an hour after sunset tonight - no bees . I went out about 3 hours later and there were five bees . I just went out again and there are eight . ( Seven are dead . ) I 've looked at these carefully - they are normal honey bees , not ground-dwellers . Any ideas why ? I 'm mostly just curious , but I 'd also like to eliminate them so I can go out barefoot again ! It is possible these were drones . For bees September through December can be the beginning of a new cycle.I quote : '' The time of day that drones fly in search of a mate depends on many factors , such as the geographic location , day length , and temperature . Drones usually fly from the hive in large numbers between 11 a.m. and 4:30 p.m . Morning or early afternoon flights may last 2 or 3 hours . Later flights are shorter . When out of the hive , drones congregate in `` mating areas , '' which may serve to attract virgin queens . These areas usually are less than 100 feet from the ground and seem to be associated with land terrain . ''",0

Do n't eat dairy products , junk food , fast food , or snack foods . Do n't eat anything that is sold in vending machines.4 . Get lots of aerobic exercise . 5 .

There are some cards that say 8x/4x compatibility , it will work in both , but if the card is only labeled as 8x , it will probably cause problems in a 4x slots , if it will work at all.The opposite can usually be done . If you have an 8x slot , a 4x will most often work just fine . However , if you have an 8x card , it requires a minimum of an 8x slot.The backwards compatibility in this case is higher slot to lower card , not the reverse .",0

"President Kennedy a gread pres. ? Why specifically is President Kennedy remembered as such a great President ? What was his greatest achievement ? He was charismatic , but he was n't a great president.His unplanned remarks to Nikita Khruschev , President of the Soviet Union , caused Khruschev to judge Kennedy to be weak . Consequently , he installed nuclear missles in Cuba . Kennedy reacted by blockading Cuba . For several days in October 1963 , the world was on the brink of a nuclear war.Shortly after taking office , he allowed plans for an invasion of Cuba to proceed . The invasion by Cuban refugees from Miami was a debacle that was a violation of international law and a humiliation to the United States.He continued the program of sending military advisors to Viet Nam . After his death , this was continued by President Lyndon Johnson and expanded into the Viet Nam war . The Viet Nam war destroyed Johnson 's presidency.To his great credit , he was aggressive about furthering the Civil Rights movement by supporting activists with Federal authority in several high profile integration efforts.If he had lived , almost surely he would have been elected to a second term . He seemed to grow wiser while in office . Would that wisdom have led him to become a great president ? Would the US have become bogged down in an unwinnable war in Viet Nam ? Would his philandering have brought him down ? Interesting questions.Wikipedia knows all.I was 10 when he was elected and 13 when he was assassinated . I will never forget the optimism he brought to the country . We believed he could lead us into the bright future . I will never forget the terror of the Cuban Missle Crisis . I will never forget the devastation I felt when he was assassinated . The United States has not been the same since . John Kennedy was the last president who _lead_ us . Presidents after him have been followers without vision.In 1989 ( I was 39 ) , I went to President Kennedy 's grave in Arlington Cemetary . Probably 15 or 20 people were there . I was amazed that people were moved to silence , even those obviously born after his presidency . I felt a great deal of reverence and had tears in my eyes .",0

"Are there any Biblical verses that refute Mormon teachings ? Please explain. ? Way too many . Here is a good link to do some research.http : //www.carm.org/mormon.htmMormons not only claim to be Christians , but to be the only true Christians . According to them , the early Christian church went through an apostacy , lost the true teaching of God , and is built on a Bible that , according to them , is translated incorrectly and is missing many books.Interestingly , while LDS Church president Gordon Hinckley assures the press that `` the New Testament is a fundamental scripture for us , '' ( Note 1 ) he fails to point out the Mormons ' bias against the Bible.Article 8 of the Mormon Articles of Faith ( Note 2 ) says , `` We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it has been translated correctly . '' This approach allows Mormons to ignore key Bible Scriptures which refute Mormon doctrines . Bible verses used to counter Mormon teachings are brushed off in favor of passages from the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scriptures ( as well as ongoing revelation that often contradicts previous LDS Church teachings ) .It should be noted that the LDS Church has published its own version of the King James Bible , incorporating footnotes explaining what corrections from Joseph Smith 's `` inspired version '' of the Bible ( a version full of errors and plagiarized material ) should be taken into account.However , in spite of their efforts at revisionism , Mormons have not been able to support their claims . On the contrary . While Mormon allegations regarding the Bible and the course of Christianity are refuted by history , archeology , and other sciences , the scriptures of the Mormon church are problematic at every turn . Far from showing us so-called 'restored truth , ' they are testimonies to the deceptive nature of Mormonism .",0

"whats the best small business to open ? In my opinion , and experience , the best small business to launch is an online business . Create websites about topics of internest to you , then put on PPC ads from servers like Yahoo Publishers Network or Adsense . You will be paid for each click , when visitors come to the site , see ads of interest to them , and click the ads . The best things about this business is the initial investment is very low . You have no inventory to stock , no orders to fill , no customers to contend with , no shoplifting , no breakage , no back breaking boxes to lift , no employees to hire , no rush hour traffic , and no credit card fraud . You are looking at monthly hosting fees of $ 20 or less , you design in , so there is no design fee . We are making over $ 4000 a month just in the PPC revenue , plus we sell ads to other business directly . We work from home , set our own hours , and just wait each month for the check from Adsense or YPN to arrive . It does n't get any easier , or any more flexible .",0

"Why US try to develop a democratic power in IRAQ when they will never be a democratic nation ? Who is to say that IRAQ will not be a democratic nation . Even the USSR was democratic in the truest sense and meaning of the word , the people could vote , problem was there was only one person they could vote for.Oil has NOTHING to do with the war in IRAQ . I wo n't even get into why but the war would be in Saudi Arabia where the oil reserves are over twice the size of Iraq.We need to look back in history to see what has happened and the future looks bright for IRAQ . Success in Central America , Liberia , Korea , the new Russia , the slavic regions , and others have formed some type of democracy.The `` democracy '' that other countries enjoy are definately not the same as ours , but even a Monarchy like Morocco has a democratic government.Success in IRAQ will indeed depend on whether democracy becomes the new form of government when America finally does pull out or if there will be political chaos and insergency.Time will only tell.To correct a couple of the other writers above me ... The United States is NOT a democratic country , it is a Federal Republic . If indeed we were a true democracy Gore would be president not George Bush ( Gore won more of the popular vote but less of the electoral vote ) .

"how small can you get a mp3 song and how would you do it ? when i rip songs from cds ( about 4 min songs ) they can be from 3-8mb can i make them smaller but not wreck the sound quality.and will the music work on an mp3 player mp3 is a compression of your music . The standard is from CD to 128 kbit/s w/ cd quality being 1400 kbit/s . To make smaller , you compress more and therefore take away quality ( details are taken out to compress . ) There are other compression formats to use , but by definition they all compress the info and therefore lose quality . Try 96 kbit/s and see if you notice a difference . ( This will be found in the recording media ; ie . the program that `` rips '' CD to mp3 . ) Again 128 is standard for not noticing quality loss . VBR is a good choice . It breaks the songs into segments so that low quality sections can have lower bit rate . Set VBR from 96-128 .",0

"What is the different between Website and Weblog ? A weblog is an online personal journal that is regularly updated on a sometimes daily basis , with a timestamp ( date of posting ) and a byline ( credit of who authored it ) . In other words , it 's nothing more than a cyber version of a diary , in which the author will post thoughts , ideas , feelings , and stories whenever the mood strikes . As opposed to a regular web site , a post can literally be published in *real time* . As a result , blogs tend to be more spontaneous and freeform than regular web sites , since the authors can publish their thoughts instantaneously . They also tend to be more personal , since blogs are usually places in which authors talk about events in their personal lives , observations , or whatever feelings they may be having at the moment.But not all blogs are personal . Some have just been places for people to post news items that they are interested in , or a gathering place for more than one person to merely post their views about current political , social , cultural or other interesting news events of the day .",0

Hi there , I know that the pressure of being a virgin is extremely hard for one to handle , especially in the Western societies that we live in ; but virginity is worth striking for . I 'm in my 20s and the group of friends that I have is also in their 20s and we are all virgins . I think the most important thing that one needs to keep in mind is that virginity is for ONESELF , not for anyone else ( or sometimes you might wan na save it for you future husband ) .

"Why are people so obssesed with Howard Stern ? I admitt , he is entertaining to watch ... but why all the posts/questions about him ? It 's probably because of the huge media attention about Howard leaving terrestrial radio -- you know , traditional AM/FM radio stations -- in favor of satellite programming service Sirius . The deal is an enormous one ( reportedly $ 500 million ) and there is a tremendous amount of attention being paid to the change . His last day on traditional radio was today , and he will launch his satellite programs in about three weeks.Additonally , Howard is one of the greatest self-promoters around . He 's spent the past year since the deal was announced talking about his move , often on his terrestrial network show . It has created a lot of friction and , of course , more attention about Howard and his big move.I do n't know if his fans , or the public in general , are more obsessed with Howard now that he 's making this change . It will allow him to do whatever he wants , as opposed to the obscenity restrictions enforced on broadcast radio by the FCC . I think it 's some of both . While many of his fans ca n't wait for Howard to do literally anything , I think that a lot of hoopla is just all the hype . He 's a national figure getting this huge deal for what is essentially an unknown quantity in Sirius . There have been some real gains in their susbscriptions as they approach the launch , but whether they will bring in enough only time -- and Howard 's popularity -- will tell .",0

"What are the perks to being an Anesthesiologist , besides the high pay ? What are the pros and cons in general ? My college buddy just married an Anesthesiologist and one thing i know is she makes an ungodly amount of money . The flaws are she has to pay for very expensive insurance for liability , she is on-call almost all the time , she works non-stop and at all hours of the night . Her first few years will be very intense as she must build her status among her peers . She has over 150,000 in debt from student loans and she did not really start making money until she turned 30.I mean the pros should be obvious , you make more then god and you kind of are playing god . if your not really careful you could end up with a god type complex , which could'nt be good for the people that are around you.good luck ! ! !",0

"how does the earth rotates itself ? Our solar system- the Sun , planets , Kuiper belt and Oort cloud , everything orbiting the sun even many times further than the orbit of Pluto- is thought to have condensed from a vast cloud of interstellar gas some billions of years ago when that cloud was shocked or squeezed by a supernova explosion . The dust and grains that condensed out of the cooling solar gas aggregated to form larger fragments of rock . Chondritic meteorites are basically just such collections of grains and fragments that have been compacted together to form a larger piece of rock and eventually small planetary bodies . Such bodies are termed planetesimals when they become roughly as large as asteroids ( several kilometres to a few hundred kilometres in dimension ) . The larger they grow , the greater the gravitational attraction that the planetesimals exert and hence the more effectively they sweep up additional particles and rock fragments while circling the Sun . ( Britannica CD ) Because that initial shockwave came from a particular direction and because the cloud was not of uniform density , the particles had a net rotation around their center of gravity . Humans subsequently identified that direction as `` counterclockwise as viewed from above the north pole of the sun '' . As the bodies of the solar system grew by accretion , particles swept up from different distances from the center of gravity ( the sun ) had different orbital velocities . Analogously , water swirling down a drain moves slower further and faster closer to the center . Galileo and Newton showed that rotational energy is conserved : The sun and planets ‘ inherited ' their spin from the orbits of their constituent particles , so to speak . Today , some five billion years later , all that rotational energy is still conserved in the rotations and revolutions of the bodies of the solar system . Our solar system is not unchanging , though . Because of gravitational interactions between moons and their planets , between the planets , meteors and comets themselves and interactions between the solar wind and the magnetospheres of the planets , rotational energy is still be ‘ traded ' back and forth : Mercury orbits in a 3:2 resonance with its rotation , our day is getting longer while the moon only shows one face towards us , the rings of the gas giants are temporary phenomena , ... But that 's another story.In other words , An act of GOD",0
"If Catholıc are donatıng a huge amount of money to charıtıes , why there always a NEWS of HUNGER ın the world Not all charities deal with hunger . The catholic church is a frequent location for the donations . The church has numerous employees at every church as well as support staff at the diocese level and at the Vatican . Most of these staff members are salaried while the Priests & etc have most of their expenses paid for through these donations . The staff members are to be treated like members of any business and receive pension and health care adding additional costs . Other costs that individual churches have include heating and cooling costs . If you think your heating bills are bad , think of a large building with lots of windows and doors frequently being opened.The church itself has numerous missions besides just feeding the hungry . Frequently churches have nurses on staff to visit the elderly home bound and others who may need help in administering special medication and can not afford nursing homes or a onsite nurse . There are frequently nuns on paid staff that visit the ill , the dying , etc . Some churches have other ministries as well depending on the local area . Catholics are also big on right to life and spend considerable resources attempting to deny people 's right to choose . They are also suppose to be opposed to the death penalty and also working against the archaic penalty but is nomally the work of a few individuals.All of these different things I have mentioned are just a few of the items that the church works on as well as hunger . That being said , Catholics are individuals and also give to other charities that they have personal interests in . From cancer research to colleges , it all stretches the dollar even further.Everywhere I have been , the protestants have tended to have much more open pocketbooks . It may have something to do with the silly notion that catholics have that every sperm is sacred and thus have more kids . The point is , everyone overlooks the most needy , not just Catholics .",0

If you block the sun with sunscreen , be sure to take enough Vitamin D , to make up for lost Vitamin D , usually received from sun exposure.Drug stores should have a suitable product such as Lubriderm - Daily UV Lotion .

Your thighs , big or small , do a relatively effective job of trapping that sweat between your legs .

This was not a secret that was kept from you and you knew what you were getting into before you got married . Do this , ask yourself these questions : Have you found any evidence that shows he has cheated or is wanting to cheat ? Have you confronted him about it and have you shared your feelings with him about this ? Is this relationship with this person really that important to you ? If any of the above answers give you that `` sick to your stomach / queezee '' feeling , then you might want to reconsider your marriage with this person . You should n't have to have these bad feelings everyday , especially if this person is supose to be your best friend and soulmate . If you are ok with it and can work things out and be happy , then YES , forgive and forget . Everyone should get a second chance.Good luck and take care .",0

"where natural digits 0123456789 are coming from ? In mathematics , a natural number is either a positive integer ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... ) or a non-negative integer ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... ) . The former definition is generally used in number theory , while the latter is preferred in set theory and computer science.Natural numbers have two main purposes : they can be used for counting ( `` there are 3 apples on the table '' ) , and they can be used for ordering ( `` this is the 3rd largest city in the country '' ) . The natural numbers developed with some difficulty . The Peano postulates state conditions that any successful definition must satisfy . Certain constructions show that , given set theory , models of the Peano postulates must exist.Peano axiomsThere is a natural number 0 . Every natural number a has a natural number successor , denoted by S ( a ) . There is no natural number whose successor is 0 . Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors : if a ≠ b , then S ( a ) ≠ S ( b ) . If a property is possessed by 0 and also by the successor of every natural number which possesses it , then it is possessed by all natural numbers .

"over 200 years ago what did Carolus Linnaeus classify living things on ? Taxonomy . In his major work Systema Naturae ( The System of Nature ) , first published in 1735 , Linnaeus devised a system of classification of organisms that is still in use today . This system places living things within increasingly specific categories based on common attributes—from a general grouping ( kingdom ) down to the specific individual ( species ) . Using this system , Linnaeus named nearly 10,000 plant and animal species in his lifetime . Not an evolutionist by any means , Linnaeus believed that each species was created by God and was incapable of change . Nevertheless , his orderly groupings of living things provided important insights for later theorists .",0

As far as `` legal '' goes , it is always preferred that people do things legally , however , rules & laws change according to society 's needs .

"what is the purpose of throwing of beads at the Mardi Gras mean ? New Orleans ' Mardi Gras revelers will spend today downing Hurricanes , gawking at naked flesh , and begging paraders for colored beads with the traditional plea , `` Throw me something , mister ! '' How did the bead-throwing custom begin ? The first recorded instances of Mardi Gras paraders tossing souvenirs to the crowd date back to the 1840s , when revelers costumed as aristocrats threw out baubles and sugar-coated almonds . Other , less savory characters preferred `` trick '' to `` treat '' and pelted onlookers with an assortment of dirt , flour , and quicklime . The dissemination of handouts—or `` throws , '' in Mardi Gras parlance—is widely believed to have derived from festival customs in Renaissance Europe , where pre-Lenten carnivals often involved projectiles ( hurled about after villagewide ale-and-mead binges ) . Some historians theorize that the tradition has roots in a pagan post-winter ritual , during which lucky peasants who 'd survived the cold months celebrated by throwing milled grain into the fields—an offering of gratitude to the deity ( or deities ) who had given them enough food to last.Glass beads did not become a New Orleans Mardi Gras staple until the 1880s , after Anglo-American `` krewes '' had formed to organize the loose-knit festivities . Legend has it that the first parade participant to use beads was a man dressed up as Santa Claus ; the ornamental strands were such a hit that other krewes picked up on the ritual . By 1900 , when at least 100,000 tourists a year flocked to the Crescent City for Mardi Gras , beaded throws were ubiquitous.Continue Articlewhy you fly nationalToday 's plastic-or-aluminum beads have earned substantial notoriety for their role in a sexual bartering system ; women often bare their breasts for a strand or two . ( And sometimes go the Full Monty for a particularly enticing throw . ) Despite claims that this custom dates back decades , a 1996 paper in the academic journal Social Forces could trace the beads-for-nudity movement only back to the 1970s.Bonus Explainer : A krewe known as `` Zulu '' has become famous for handing out ( not throwing ) Mardi Gras coconuts in lieu of beads . The practice ceased briefly in the 1980s , owing to liability concerns—no insurance company would cover Zulu , fearing that an errant coconut might dent a merrymaker 's skull . Zulu leaders appealed to the Louisiana state legislature , pointing out that beads and other Mardi Gras trinkets were exempted from liability laws . In 1987 , then-Governor Edwin Edwards signed the `` Coconut Bills , '' adding Zulu 's heavy , oblong handouts to the list .",0
"Why was an embargo put on Cuba ? `` When , on January 7 , 1959 , Fidel Castro assumed control of Cuba after President Fulgencio Batista fled on December 31 , the U.S. government initially supported the Cuban Revolution , formally recognizing the new government . However , relations rapidly deteriorated when the new Cuban government passed the first Agrarian Reform Law to begin expropriation of large-scale ( largely American-owned ) land holdings on May 17 , 1959 . The compensation offered ( based on 20-year bonds at 4.5 % interest for the tax-assessed value ) was seen as inadequate , and was rejected by American interests . Animosity escalated with the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis . After that , the U.S. promised never to invade Cuba again , but resorted to financial measures instead . `` This embargo initially caused damage to the Cuban economy , but 45 years later , has very little effect . This is why many ( aside from GW Bush ) have called for lifting the embargo .",0

"Why did the US drop the A bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki ? ? After the resistance offered by the Japanese on their home islands such as Okinawa , the American and allied Generals believed the US and allied troops would receive up to 1 million casualties as a result of a land invasion of the Japanese mainland . Consequently the decision was made to drop the first 'A ' bomb . As the Japanese surrender was not forthcoming the second bomb was dropped . The main benefit to this decision for the allies was to flex her muscles to the Russians who were becoming increasingly recalcitrant towards the west.I hope this helps , Brett",0
"can wood be liquified ? well , it depends on what you mean by `` liquefied '' . most certainly it can be ground or sanded into a fine dust ( sawdust ) and then mixed with water - voila , liquified wood.on the other hand , if you mean melted , the way you melt ice or iron.. not really , no . wood is a pretty complex substance , with lots of different kinds of chemicals arranged into cells . chemically speaking , it 's mostly carbon and water , and trace amounts of a bazillion other chemicals . if you heat it up , some other chemical reactions will happen first ( combustion , for instance , in the presence of oxygen ) . in the absence of oxygen , you make charcoal if you heat wood to around 300C - the water evaporates away , the bonds break and all the other chemicals are driven out . what 's left is a chunk of solid , mostly ( 90 % ) carbon in noncrystalline or `` amorphous '' form . if you KEEP heating it , always without any oxygen because it 'll burn otherwise - eventually this stuff will melt , but solid carbon melts at around 3800C , which is getting pretty close to the temperature of the surface of the sun . so it 's pretty difficult to do , though if you increase the pressure , the melting temperature will go down - this is how they make synthetic diamonds.otherwise , wood can be `` liquefied '' through other chemical processes , such as decomposition/rotting - this is where oil comes from - but by the time it 's liquid , it hardly qualifies as wood anymore.so , i guess the short answer to the question is no , it ca n't be .",0

But I still want to stay healthy . So I want to know if this is a good way to do so without changing the way I am ? The human body comprises chemical compounds such as water , amino acids ( proteins ) , fatty acids ( lipids ) , nucleic acids ( DNA/RNA ) , and carbohydrates ( e.g . sugars ) . These compounds in turn consist of elements such as carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , and phosphorus , and may or may not contain minerals such as calcium , iron , and zinc . Minerals also ubiquitously occur in the form of salts and electrolytes . All of these chemical compounds and elements occur in various forms and combinations ( e.g . hormones/vitamins , phospholipids , hydroxyapatite ) , both in the human body and in organisms ( e.g . plants , animals ) that humans eat.The human body must necessarily comprise those elements that humans eat and absorb into the bloodstream . The digestive system , except in the unborn fetus , is the first step in helping to make the different chemical compounds and elements in food available for the trillions of cells of the body . In the digestive process of an average adult , about seven litres of liquid , known as digestive juices , exit the internal body and enter the lumen of the digestive tract . The digestive juices help break chemical bonds between ingested compounds as well as modulate the conformation and/or energetic state of the compounds/elements . Yet many compounds/elements are absorbed into the bloodstream unchanged , though the digestive process helps to release them from the matrix of the foods where they occur . Any unabsorbed matter is eliminated in the feces . Only a minimal amount of digestive juice is eliminated this way ; the intestines reabsorb most of it otherwise the body would rapidly dehydrate ( hence the devastating effects of persistent diarrhea ) .Study in this field must take into careful account the state of the body before ingestion and after digestion as well as the chemical content of both the food and the waste . The specific types of compounds and elements that are absorbed by the body can be determined by comparing the waste to the food . The effect that the absorbed matter has on the body can be determined by finding the difference between the pre-ingestion state and the post-digestion state . The effect may only be discernible after an extended period of time in which all food and ingestion must be exactly regulated and all waste must be analyzed . The number of variables ( e.g . 'confounding factors ' ) involved in this type of experimentation is very high . This makes scientifically valid nutritional study very time-consuming and expensive , which accounts for why a proper science of human nutrition is rather new.In general , eating a variety of fresh , whole ( unprocessed ) foods has proven hormonally and metabolically favourable compared to eating a monotonous diet based on processed foods . In particular , fresh , whole foods provide higher amounts and a more favourable balance of essential and vital nutrients per unit of energy , resulting in better management of cell growth , maintenance , and mitosis ( cell division ) as well as of appetite and energy balance . A generally more regular eating pattern ( e.g . eating medium-sized meals every 3 to 4 hours ) has also proven more hormonally and metabolically favourable than infrequent , haphazard food intake.Vitamins give you a complement among all the nutrients your body requires . It is not advisable at all to substitute entirely your meals with vitamins and dietary or food supplements . I recommend you to look for a nutritional advisor and discuss in which way you can adjust your meals , having all the necessary elements your body needs , plus , eating only what you like .",0

She might also realize how unsatisfied she is by you and your marriage will suffer , especially when the other guy is much more experienced with pleasuring a woman and gives her orgasm after orgasm .

Remember that a condom will not protect against all of them , such as genital warts , and you could both end up unlucky recipients of STDs that you 'll carry the rest of your lives . But if you do n't mind all of these factors , go have fun ! You might also try just being more adventurous in the bedroom with your wife . There is a lot you can do together without involving other people that will really spice up your sex life .",0
"how can i get a high paying job ? Depends on what you mean by `` high paying '' . If it 's just about TONS of money then anything in the executive level is going to work for you . However , you will need at least a MBA in a business related field . Also , you will need to invest years into managerial jobs that will lead you up the ladder.OR - you can get a geat idea for some computer related start-up and get some venture capital and become successful ... however , lots of startups can ( and do ) fail.If your looking for a quick buck - sell drugs - but then go to jail or get killed.It 's really finding out what YOU like to do and then make it your life 's ambition to make it into a high paying job .

sound intensity ? Two sounds have intensities 510-3 and 910-7 W/m2 .

What is the difference between a savings account and a money market account ? Money Market accounts typically offer a much higher rate of return than savings accounts . They invest in super safe securities such as short term bonds and t-bills . They are completely liquid ( you can make withdraws whenever ) .

They also adjust to the current interest rate much faster than savings accounts which typically move like molasses on a winter day .,0

"is the luxury class basically parasitic in nature ? like i see a lot of wives basking in the reflected glory of their husbands ... aint this simply a parasitic existence ? The class alone is not merely parasitic . If not for the luxury class , who would start businesses ? Not to mention that the service industry feeds off of this class , indeed depends on the luxury of others ( the luxury of being able to afford restaurants , hotels , etc . ) to support them . We live too closely bound on this planet in every way to consider any part of our society parasitic . The institutions of welfare and the like are parasitic in nature , but the people on these services are not parasitic by nature either . They are merely taking advantage of a service which should not be offered in the first place.And I work full time , and live under the poverty line . This is not the elite speaking .

"The End Times : Great Revival or Great Apostasy ? Many prophecies in mainstream Christianity have come out declaring a great influx ( revival ) of souls into the Kingdom of God before Jesus returns . Why then does Jesus declare : And then shall many be offended , and shall betray one another , and shall hate one another . And many false prophets shall rise , and shall deceive many . And because iniquity shall abound , the love of many shall wax cold . But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved . ( Matthew 24:10-13 ) And why would He ask : ... Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ? ( Luke 18:8 ) Just curious to hear others ' opinions ... 2 Thes . 2:1-3 ( NKJV ) Now , brethren , concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him , we ask you , [ 2 ] not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled , either by spirit or by word or by letter , as if from us , as though the day of Christ had come .

"Where , when , and why did the Holocaust happen ? Come on , if you are hoping for an easy answer to your homework , in several minutes you will have all the wikipedia links you could ever want on this subject . If you are hoping for non-attributable material in essay form , you wo n't get it here.Answers ... The Holocaust , meaning the Nazi German program to eradicate `` undesirable races '' like Jews , Gypsies and Slavs , happened primarily in what is now known as Poland and Germany , although one could argue that the round ups and other terror spread throughout most of occupied Europe.The rough period of the Holcaust varies depending on opinions . I rather believe it started with Kristalnacht on November 10 , 1938 and did n't end until 1945 with the final liberation . Survivors and their familes might tell you that they still suffer , therefore it has n't ended.Why is more complicated . I would read `` Hitler 's Willing Executioners '' by Daniel Goldhagen for a fairly succinct answer . However , it was the result of Nazi Germany 's effort to `` purify '' the `` Aryan '' ( what toff , as though they were Aryan ) race by killing off the so-called `` sub-humans '' .",0

"Have you seen Munich ? How was it ? are you referring to the city or the movie ? since your question 's in the movie category , i assume this is about the movie ? the one starring eric bana ? This movie attempts to illuminate both sides of Israel 's conflict . While the focus is on Israeli actions and choices , Palestinian and Arab motivations are present throughout the work . For me , Speilberg 's treatment of both sides was an attempt at balance . Neither side is commended or exaulted for their behavior . Instead , the film attempts to generally question the nature of their decisions and acts . If this film does make any stance on Israel and Palestine , it makes a general condemnation of the violence on both sides . Speilberg goes through great lengths to show the cycle of violence - lamenting the perpetual loss of life in violent conflict.The film 's conclusion extends Speilberg 's effort to question violence and its role in human affairs . The protagonist chooses against returning home - he lives in exile . The cycle of violence has taken a toll on him . I 'm unclear in deciding whether the protagonist approves or condemns of his own choices . But I do believe that he realizes that violence is not a future solution . I think that this was a geniune attempt at thoughtful reflection of the consequences of violent conflict . For a mainstream movie , this had unusual depth . I felt that there was an honest attempt to depict both sides as human beings - with rational , legitmate values and motivations . I would encourage anyone to see this film . Audiences should try to analyze both the film 's perspective and their our own beliefs on the real world content behind the work . Any film that can spark people to pose these serious questions deserves attention .",0

"Preparing a Solution ? How many grams of CaCl2 are needed to prepare 147.5 mL of a 1.270 M solution ? Please explain your answer so I can learn : D. Thanks ! 1 mole ( also represented as mol ) = 6.022x10^23 . This is just a number . Molecules are represented in mol quantities because they 're too small to work with otherwise . So that when you are dealing with CaCl2 in these problems , you 're actually using 6.022x10^23 molecules of CaCl2 . Additionally , when you see the molecular weight of a molecule , that is actually the weight of 1mol of that molecule.1M= 1mol/Litre . You need 1.27M . Divide 1.27 by 1,000 to find the number of mol CaCl2 per mL you need . ( 1.27/1,000=0.00127mol CaCl2/mL ) Multiply this by 147.5 to get the number of mol CaCl2 you will have . ( 0.00127*147.5= 0.187325mol CaCl2 ) Now multiply this number by the molecular weight of CaCl2 to get your answer ! ( 0.187325*110.984= 20.79g CaCl2 )",0

what is a double layer DVD burner ? Movie DVDs you buy in the store can contain up to 8.5 gigabytes of data . This is because they are pressed ( as opposed to burned ) dual-layer DVDs ( also called DVD-9 ) . The recordable DVD+-Rs that have been on the market for a while a single-layer DVD-5s and can store up to 4.7 gigabytes . This disrepency is why programs that copy movie DVDs need to compress the DVD content after unencrypting it before they can be burned to a normal DVD . Recently new DVD burners and media were introduced that allowed people to burn DVD-9 DVDs reasonably affordably.So a double-layer DVD burner is one that is capable of burning 8.5 gigabyte DVD-9 format DVDs.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd # Technical_information,0

"um..i got ta queston ? does anyone know of any kind of product , thats not that expensive for acne . Because i 've tried several different things , but they do n't want to seem to work . Okay 1. what causes acne ? 2.what should I use to clear it ? hormonesFor most people with acne , it begins at puberty . This is when the body starts to produce hormones called androgens . Androgens cause the enlargement and overstimulation of the sebaceous glands in people with acne . Sensitivity to these androgens also cause acne to appear during the menstrual cycle and sometimes in pregnancy . The extra sebum ( oil ) that the sebaceous glands produce mixes with dead skin cells and bacteria on the skin 's surface and this blocks pores . Inside the blocked pore , bacteria multiply and cause inflammation leading to the spots and pustules associated with acne.stressStress can also cause the production of hormones , such as cortisol , which can aggravate acne.other causes * Acne is often genetic * Some medications and steroids * Heavy or oily make up * Over abrasive cleansing o Astringent facial products can dry the skin out causing the body to create even more sebum to compensate o Use of harsh exfoliators can damage existing spots and spread infection o Picking or squeezing of blackheads , whiteheads and spots can send the infection deeper into the skin and cause scarring * A diet high in foods that can aggravate acneou really can get rid of acne , naturally . How ? By learning about the causes of acne and how to rebalance the body . By understanding that applying harsh chemicals to the skin can actually exacerbate the skin 's natural oil production and make acne worse . Why is it that people who do n't eat a Western diet do n't have acne ? You , too , can get rid of acne by understanding why it 's predominantly a Western problem . In parts of the world where a Western diet is being adopted , they are now getting acne.Our bodies are fine-tuned machines , continually creating new cells and getting rid of dead cells . There are three processes vital to human health ; appropriation ( taking in food , air , water etc ) , assimilation ( absorbing nutrients to create new cells ) and elimination ( expelling waste/toxins ) . If any one of these is unbalanced , this can lead to less than vital health . We need to take in the right fuel , use it effectively and get rid of by-products and waste . For example , we get rid of waste via the digestive system , the lungs and the skin ; if the digestive system is sluggish waste may have to be expelled via the skin as blocked pores and acne .",0
"how could i install program to other drive ? It depends on the program.Most professional programs will allow you to choose between a CUSTOM INSTALL and an Express Install . If so , choose CUSTOM INSTALL . This will allow you to choose program features to install and , usually , the installation folder . For the installation folder , there will usually be a BROWSE button . Click on that and select the drive and folder for the installation.If there is n't a CUSTOM INSTALL choice , you still might be presented with a default folder and a BROWSE button . Click on the BROWSE button and select the drive and folder you want to use.NOTE : Most programs allow you to type in your own folder name , even if it does n't already exist . These programs will usually tell you the folder does n't exist and ask your permission to create the folder . Click YES or OK to create the folder.I highly suggest that you keep a well-organized naming scheme throughout your use of the computer.EXAMPLE : I have a C : & # 92 ; Program Files & # 92 ; under which I have a lot of program folders . I also have a D : & # 92 ; Program Files & # 92 ; with program folders under that ( this is where I put utilities and small applications ) .

"Fibromyalgia ? Help ? ? ? ? 15 yr old with severe fibromyalgia ... any tips ? Find answers to these issues and you will live with less pain More effective , guilt-free communications with family and friends about symptoms Avoiding frustrations at the doctor 's office , which may range from discussing symptoms to requesting specific therapies Handling demands on limited time Keeping up with job duties or household tasks without causing a flare-up Striving for and maintaining a better quality of life—one that makes you both happier and healthier How to respond to hurtful comments from others TreatmentIn general , treatment for fibromyalgia is with a combination of medication and self-care . The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health.MedicationsMedications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep . The ones most commonly recommended by doctors include : Analgesics . Over-the-counter acetaminophen ( Tylenol , others ) may ease the pain and stiffness caused by fibromyalgia . However , its effectiveness varies with individuals . Tramadol ( Ultram ) is a prescription pain reliever that may be taken with or without acetaminophen . Your doctor may have you take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) — such as aspirin , ibuprofen ( Advil , Motrin , others ) or naproxen sodium ( Anaprox , Aleve ) — in conjunction with other medications , but NSAIDs have n't proven to be effective in managing the pain in fibromyalgia when taken by themselves . Antidepressants . Your doctor may prescribe antidepressant medications , such as amitriptyline , nortriptyline ( Aventyl , Pamelor ) or doxepin ( Sinequan ) to help promote sleep . Fluoxetine ( Prozac ) in combination with amitriptyline has also been found effective . Sertraline ( Zoloft ) and paroxetine ( Paxil ) also are effective if you 're suffering from depression . These medications may be beneficial by affecting serotonin levels in the brain . Muscle relaxants . Taking the medication cyclobenzaprine ( Flexeril ) at bedtime may help treat muscle pain and spasms . Benzodiazepines . These drugs may help relax muscles and promote sleep . Usually , doctors avoid benzodiazepines in treating fibromyalgia because they have n't been shown to have long-term benefit and have the potential for drug dependence . Prescription sleeping pills , such as zolpidem ( Ambien ) , may provide short-term benefits for some people with fibromyalgia , but doctors usually advise against long-term use of these drugs . These medications tend to work for only a short time , after which your body becomes resistant to their effects . Ultimately , using sleeping pills tends to create even more sleeping problems in many people.Doctors do n't usually recommend narcotics for treating fibromyalgia because of the potential for dependence and addiction . Corticosteroids , such as prednisone , have n't been shown to be effective in treating fibromyalgia.Cognitive-behavioral therapyCognitive-behavioral therapy seeks to increase your belief in your own abilities and teaches you methods for dealing with stressful situations . Therapy can be provided via individual counseling , audiotapes or classes , and may help you manage your fibromyalgia.Treatment programsInterdisciplinary treatment programs may be effective in improving your symptoms , including relieving pain . These programs can combine a variety of treatments , such as relaxation techniques , biofeedback and receiving information about chronic pain . There is n't one combination that works best for everybody . Your doctor can create a program based on what works best for you . Self-careSelf-care is critical in the management of fibromyalgia . Important aspects of self-care include taking these actions : Reduce stress . Develop a plan to avoid or limit overexertion and emotional stress . Allow yourself time each day to relax . That may mean learning how to say no without guilt . But do n't change your routine totally . People who quit work or drop all activity tend to do worse than those who",0

"What are the pros and cons of Nuclear thermal propulsion ? Is it feasible to use it in a manned mission to moon ? How is it better than nuclear electric propulsion ? What will be its harmful effects ? Will it violate the NTBT ? Project Orion was an idea in the 1960s to use nuclear explosions to push a space ship around the solar system . The idea was to use a lot of small explosions in succession to create the sort of effect one gets with a continious burn from the usual chemical fueled rockets.There were some small scale tests done with non-nuclear nukes , which suggested the concept was n't crazy , but there was never any full scale tests , and certainly nothing using fission bombs.It is not clear that scaling this concept up to the size needed for a manned rocket would be that feasible , although some disagree with that assesment . There would be a tremendous stress on the vehicle from all these explosions , especially if they were more contained ( in order to harness more of the explosive power for thrust ) .But , I do n't think we 'll ever see anything like this unless there is some sort of mass evacuation of the planet . ( Not there is anywhere to go . ) As you might expect , a Project Orion rocket is essentially the same as a huge number of atmospheric atomic explosions . Not exactly enviro-friendly , to say the least.IF by `` nuclear thermal '' propulsion you mean the generators used by some space probes to generate electricity , then these are far to weak for a manned vehicle . They could n't supply the power to lift off from Earth , and a trip to the moon using an electric ion drive takes much , much longer than the more direct chemically driven Apollo trajectory . Ion propulsion has tried on the space probe Deep Space 1 , although this was not nuclear powered .",0

"What does a scaled score of 363 mean on the MAT ? The MAT scaled scores currently range from 200 to 600 with a mean ( average ) of 400 . So a score of 363 is somewhat below the average score . In order to know just how much below average this score represents you need to know the standard deviation of the test to see if it 363 is greater than one standard deviation below the norm . Otherwise it would fall within the normal range.Your personal score report should also have given you a percentile rank , which tells you how you did in comparison with others who took the test . This is sometimes easier to understand than standard scores . For example , a percentile rank of 45 means that you scored as high or higher than 45 out of 100 people who took the test .",0

"What is the wicca religon ? I have always wondered . Wicca is a Neopagan religious movement found in many different countries , though most commonly in English-speaking cultures . Wicca was first publicised in 1954 after the repeal of the British Witchcraft Act , by a British civil servant named Gerald Gardner . He claimed that the religion , of which he was an initiate , was a modern survival of an old witch cult , which had existed in secret for hundreds of years , originating in the pre-Christian Paganism of Europe . Wicca is thus sometimes referred to as the Old Religion . The veracity of Gardner 's claims is now much debated , and it is thought that much if not all of Wiccan theology was established no earlier than the 1920s . Since its founding , various related Wiccan traditions have evolved , or been adapted from , the form established by Gardner , which came to be called Gardnerian Wicca . These other traditions of Wicca each have specific beliefs , rituals , and practices . Most traditions of Wicca remain secretive and require members to be initiated , however there is a growing movement of Eclectic or Solitary Wiccans who adhere to the religion but do not believe a traditional initiation is necessary . Gardnerian Wicca is perhaps the most popular of the traditions excepting Solitary Wicca . you can find more information also in the address that i give you",0

Others , myself included , feel that school should teach more than that . A successful school teaches future citizens the skills that will help them be independent , successful workers . Learning how to meet deadlines , working with others in a peaceful manner , conflict resolution , appropriate behavior and dress in a work environment -- all of these are fostered in school and are vital in the working world .

The college will also require you and your parents to fill out IRS Form 4506–T before they will give you any financial aid . On the IRS form , enter your personal information and select `` Verification of Nonfiling '' . The IRS will mail you and your parents a letter of proof that you did not file a return for last year . Simply take the letter to the college along with a copy of you and your parents W2 to receive the financial aid you are eligible for . This extra step is required as a security precaution to prevent people from lying about their income to receive additional financial aid .",0

"Is ice made from a salt/water solution actually colder than just water ice ? If you put both solutions in the kitchen freezer would the salt ice be colder than the water one , or would the salt solution stay liquid ? If you were able to get the salt solution cold enough , it would freeze . However , if you put two ice trays side by side , one filled with water , the other filled with salt water , and chilled them to the point where both froze , the would both be the same temperature . However , once the cold was taken away , the salt solution would melt at a much lower temperature than the water only cubes.What salt does when added to water is decrease the temperature at which water will freeze -- as well as melt . How much the freezing/melting point is lowered depends on how much salt is added . The higher the concentration , the lower the freezing/melting point .",0

"what are the solutions for female hair lossing ? The most common type of hair loss seen in women is androgenetic alopecia , also known as female pattern alopecia . Alopecia means baldness , but just as in men , it does not have to be complete hair loss . This is seen as hair thinning predominantly over the top and front of the head . It affects approximately one-third of all susceptible women , but is most commonly seen after menopause Female pattern hair loss may begin as early as puberty . In these cases if there are signs of hormone imbalance , such as excess facial or body hair , a hormone evaluation should be done . Hormonal changes are a common cause of female hair loss . Many women do not realize that hair loss can occur after pregnancy or following discontinuation of birth control pills . It may also follow any sudden physical or psychological stress to the body . These types of hair loss are `` Telogen Effluvium '' and are usually temporary . It is important to remember that this hair loss may be delayed by up to three months following the change . Up to 8 months will be required for regrowth to be fully achieved.Treatment often starts with Rogaine ( topical minoxidil 2 % ) . Rogaine is the only FDA approved medication currently available for female pattern hair loss . The other hair loss medication , Propecia , just does n't work in women at all . Aldactone ( spironolactone ) pills help many women , especially whose hair loss starts before menopause but takes many months . Hormone replacement pills , such as Prempro , plus Aldactone are better after menopause . Experienced hair transplant surgeons can often achieve excellent results in women with the new follicular unit and minigraft techniques . You have to be a qualified candidate and have realistic expectations .",0

"What exactly do stem cells do ? I 've come across a product that claims to promote the release of adult stem cells : what would be the benefit of that ? Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can , under the right conditions , turn into any other kind of cell . They are of particular interest to scientists in that they may provide a means to replace damaged cells that the body can not naturally replaced ( in the spinal chord , for example ) . Stem cells are often talked about ( not inacurately ) in the context of curing numerous degenerative neurological conditions ( Parkinsons , Altzeimers , ALS , etc . ) as well as other conditions that can be traced to the malfunction of a particular type of cell ( they could be used , for example , to replace insuline-sectreteing cells in type I diabetes ) .Although I have not heard of a product like the one you mentioned , I would be inclined to say it does absolutely nothing . Stem cells are only useful if they can be made to differentiate and become a specific type the specific type of cell that is needed , where that type of cell is needed . Flooding the body with stem cells will not make that happen . My best guess is that it is an attempt to profit off the wide-spread association of the term `` stem cell '' with curing uncurable diseases and , by extention , with improved health in general .",0

"hi , my stomach is growing day by day i want it to reduce in 1 week plz help me i m20 yrs old thax bye ? I 'm guessing on this one . If you do n't have a health problem causing this , you should reflect on what is different . Meaning what are you doing and not doing now . A lot of young adults gain weight just from the freedom of being able to eat what they want when they want . Also maybe you are not active enough . Try just eating a less , but healthy . Adding very small treats , to make it easy to stick to . Then incorporate excersize . Start small so you wo n't hate it . Soon you will be able to gradually have a good workout . Do n't plan on loosing it in one week unless you would like a heart attack . If you do n't beleive me , do some research or ask your doctor . Today this doe n't sound so hot , but these changes should make you happy .",0

properties of a gentleman ? Kindess ; consideration of others needs/feelings above his own ; smiles & nods his head or tips his hat when passing a lady ( young or old ) on the street ; opens doors for ladies ; when walking with a lady down the street he makes sure shes on the inside for her protection ; never uses fowl language in front of women or children ; loves his mother and isnt afraid to show it ; loves his wife ( or g/f ) and children and would rather come home to them then go out partying with his friends ; respect for the law and even more respect for the law Giver ( God ) ; stands up-removes his hat and sings loudly & proudly when the Star Spangled banner is played at sporting events ; also stands & removes hat and maybe even applauds when a color gaurd displaying our Flag passes him during a parade ; and isnt embarrassed by either of these ! Absolute respect for those men and women who gave their lives for our country and just as much respect for those who faught and came home again .

"how are ionic solids formed ? Ionic solids are indeed formed by a gain and loss of electrons . More specifically , they are formed by a chemical reaction between a metal atom and a nonmetal atom . For example , sodium , a metal , has a tendency to want to lose an electron , and bromine , a nonmetal , wants to gain an electron , so the sodium gives an electron to bromin ( which is now called bromide ) . Now sodium has lost an electron , which is negatively charged , so it has a net charge of 1+ . Bromine has gained an electron , so it has a net charge of -1 . Since they are oppositely charged , they are attracted to each other ( kind of like how opposite poles of magnets are atracted to each other ) , they ionically bond and become an ionic solid ( also known as a salt ) .",0

"How can I start jogging when you are 42 years old and out of shape ? Start slow.AND BUY A GOOD PAIR OF SHOES . Do n't just go to any department store .

They will give you a good pair of shoes and you may want to specifiy that you want really good shock absorbant shoes . After you go to the specialty store you can buy them there ( or look for the same shoes cheaper online ) . Usually joggign shoes will be a half size larger than your regular shoes to give your foot more room.Start with walking then slowly speed up ... Build up your distance and speed over several weeks . First start with builing up distance ... walk 1-3 miles . Once you are comfortable with that- work on your speed . Slowly your walk will be a fast walk , and then eventually a jog . Build up your speed and distance over several weeks . Remember do n't do it too fast . Any excerise is more than none ( and better than hurting yourself . )",0

"Im keeping a food diary to control my food intake , as I have to drop about 30 pounds . Does it really work ? Experts say writing down your eating habits will keep your diet on track -- even when you slip up and eat a few things you wish you hadn't.Food journals can help keep portions under control . For example , do n't just write that you ate chicken for dinner . Write down how many ounces that piece of chicken was . And how many pieces you consumed . Information on gauging portions can be found on the Internet . If you are not seeing a dietician , you can cross-check your daily food intake with the USFDA food guide pyramid . The Food and Nutrition Information Center Web site provides a USFDA food guide pyramid at www.nalusda.gov/fnic/index.html . The Web site includes USFDA food pyramids for ethnic foods as well.Wondering if you 've eat enough servings of fruit and vegetables ? A food journal can help you figure it out . While it 's not helpful to everyone , many people report food journal success.No matter what you 're weight loss or eating goal , scribbling your snacking habits down is a good idea , experts say .

"There are two Beliefs of Christ in Judism , What are they ? The newest technique used by Christian missionaries and other Christian Clergy , is what they call learning about `` The Jewish Roots of Christianity . '' One might think this means how , in their opinion , Christianity began with Jews , or developed from Judaism . However , this is not what they mean by `` the Jewish Roots . '' The way they show that the roots of Christianity are to be found in Judaism is that they put a Christian theological interpretation into a Jewish ceremony or ritual . Then they claim that this planted Christian theological interpretation , having been `` found '' in something Jewish ( because it was planted there by them in the first place ) , shows that Christianity came from Judaism . This is nonsense , and shows the lengths they will go to , in order to obtain for themselves Jewish legitimacy.You must understand that both Jews and Christians use the word messiah , but the meaning of the word is different in each faith.The Christian understanding is that the Messiah , Jesus , died for the sins of the people . The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin . But we are taught in our Bible that no one can die for the sins of another . In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin . [ Deuteronomy 24:16 ] God is not a man , that he should lie ; neither the Son of Man , that he should repent : hath he said , and shall he not do it ? or hath he spoken , and shall he not make it good ?

"How did `` black comedy '' and `` rap music '' evolved from minstrel shows in America ? Minstrel shows were obstensibly a caricature of African-American culture , reaching the height of their popularity in the mid-19th Century.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_showBy and large , rap and hip-hop developed in the 1970 's as a natural progression from disco , jazz , beat poetry , raggae , and other African Diasporic cultural genres interacting with each other and creating something new.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_musicHumor , as an entertainment genre , created and performed by African-Americans does n't have much of a presence in American popular culture until the 70's.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_sitcomhttp : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special : Search ? search=african+american+comedians & go=GoIn this way , there 's not much of a direct relationship between minstrel shows and contemporary African-American entertainment in terms of `` lineage . '' However , racism - of which minstrel shows are one example - is a frequent topic of discussion.Example - In the `` When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong '' sketch of Chappelle 's Show Season 2 episode 7 : Dave plays Vernon Franklin , an African-American yuppie who feels like an `` Uncle Tom '' because he likes and gets along with his white co-workers . So instead of letting an awkward comment from co-worker and mentor Frank Murphy slide , he over-reacts.Frank : Vernon , great job buddy . You da man ! Give me some skin , huh ? Vernon : Get your m*f*in hand out of my face , man . You heard me m*f*er get your hand out of my face ! What you think this is - just shake my hand like a man ! .. ' Gim me some five , on the black-hand side , with all this crazy jive ' ? That 's b*s* . Do you want a little soft-shoe ? Should I juggle some watermelon ? Man ; f* all that ! Obviously , the humor is in the over-reaction . But at the same time , Chappelle is tapping into the sensitivity many people have concerning racial stereotypes : The comment about `` dancing a soft-shoe '' is a direct reference to minstrel show caricaturing of African-Americans .",0

"How do you teach romance to a husband who has no clue ? Seriously , last year my husband walked in the door and my four year old greeted him with `` Happy Valentine 's Day , Daddy ! '' He went right back out and bought the last dozen roses at the florist . The year before that he got me an ugly house plant on the 15th . Is really all that hard ? I just wanted a real kiss before he left this morning , and I honestly would have felt the love . . . just a simple out of the ordinary kiss would have been what worked ! Maybe start doing for him and he will do in return ? Talk to him , maybe something is on his mind . Guys sometimes do n't know how to treat a woman . But it is the thought that counts . Do n't knock him for trying . He did manage to get that last bouquet of flowers right ?",0

Denver or Not ? Is denver a good city to live in or is better to go to a smaller city maybe like Colorado springs or maybe just into the foothills or mountains on 70. well in denver the city is very spread out and the mass transit has not caught up to the growth that we have experienced . i would move as close to your job as you can . the smaller towns do offer some wonderful views and great lifestyle but it seems that many have caught on to this idea and traffic can be horrible . another thing you have to take into account is that if you are coming from a bigger city you will not have as many options for night life . many things close at 2:00am and we have blue light laws which limit the sale of bottles of alcohol and we have 3.2 beer so you have to watch for those things when you move to a new city .,0

"How do I raise my credit score fast and without paying some company to erase stuff off my report ? Basic but effective tequniques or tricks if you know them . If someone asks you for money to increase your score , it is true that they are likely to be a thief , however , it is NOT TRUE that you can not raise your score . Your credit score is primarily affected by a few things . First , any time that you make a late payment , even one that is only 30 days late , that will effect your score as much as 50 points the first month . It will climb slowly each month thereafter if you pay on time . So , do n't ever pay late . Secondly , a large part of your score is determined by the ratio of credit used to credit available . If you have a $ 1,000 limit on your card , DO NOT leave a balance on that card of over $ 500 . The lower your credit debt to credit limits , the better your score will be . Lastly , the longer you have credit , the better . Some people will cancel cards and accounts that are infrequently used . Do n't do that ! Leave them open . On the other hand , having too many credit accounts means you are a credit hog . Every time you apply for credit , your score will go down , for a few months .",0
"What is a worm , trojan ? and how is it different from a computer virus ? Trojan horse is a malicious program that is disguised as legitimate software.A Trojan horse program has a useful and desired function , or at least it has the appearance of having such . In most cases the program performs other , undesired functions , but not always . The useful , or seemingly useful , functions serve as camouflage for these undesired functions . The kind of undesired functions are not part of the definition of a Trojan Horse ; they can be of any kind.In practice , Trojan Horses in the wild often contain spying functions ( such as a packet sniffer ) or backdoor functions that allow a computer , unbeknownst to the owner , to be remotely controlled from the network , creating a `` zombie computer '' . Because Trojan horses often have these harmful functions , there often arises the misunderstanding that such functions define a Trojan Horse.The basic difference from computer viruses is : a Trojan horse is technically a normal computer program and does not possess the means to spread itself . Originally Trojan horses were not designed to spread themselves . They relied on fooling people to allow the program to perform actions that they would otherwise not have voluntarily performed . Trojans of recent times also contain functions and strategies that enable their spreading . This moves them closer to the definition of computer viruses , and it becomes difficult to clearly distinguish such mixed programs between Trojan horses and viruses .",0

"I am obsessing about a cold sore , should i worry or am i being a hypochondriac ? Do not become orally intimate with someone 's nether regions , ( just in case you were thinking of doing that ) with a cold sore . I was just at the doctor for the cold sores that I get on my lip and they informed me that yes in fact you can spread the virus that way . Do n't obsess , stress can make them worse and cause them to come out more frequently . If you get them on a semi regular basis , go to a clinic or your regular doctor , they have an anti-viral pill that will help you greatly . Abreva and such only dry out the blisters , so does ear wax believe it or not . Most adults have the herpe virus in their system , but a smaller percentage have symptoms . Ice also breaks the virus down quicker once you have the blisters , and aspirin will reduce pain and take the swelling down . Do n't ever break the blisters they are freakishly contagious . Other than that , relax , they 're a pain in the ass , but unless you have a problem with your immune system , you 'll live .",0

"Do they really have govt . grants anyone can get ? It is hard to find grants to start a business . Unlike the myths that some perpetuate , federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business . And yes , grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it , that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.Nonetheless , you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance ( CFDA ) http : //www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http : //www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants . Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.Even if you buy books on `` how to get grants '' or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has , albeit packaged differently . But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.Even SBA does NOT give out grants . From the SBA website http : //www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html '' The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses , although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs . ( See http : //www.sba.gov/financing for more information ) While SBA does offer some grant programs , these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management , technical , or financial assistance . These grants generally support non-profit organizations , intermediary lending institutions , and state and local governments . `` Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements ( e.g . minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant # 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities ( grant 59.043 Women 's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women 's business center that will train women entrepreneurs For private grants , you may want to check the Foundation Center 's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online .

"What is everything you know about the VIETNAM WAR. ? i need everything and anything you know or may come across . thanks . Basically , it was a failure ( like today 's war in Iraq ) and many American soldiers ' lives were lost.The Vietnam War or Second Indochina War 1 was a conflict between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( DRVN , or North Vietnam ) , allied with the National Liberation Front ( NLF , or `` Viet Cong '' ) against the Republic of Vietnam ( RVN , or South Vietnam ) , and its allies — notably the United States military in support of the South , with US combat troops involved from shortly after the Korean War until the official withdrawal in 1975.After France 's attempted recolonization of Indochina was defeated in 1954 by the Viet Minh at the battle of Điện Biên Phủ , an agreement to temporarily partition the country in two with a de-militarized zone ( DMZ ) was reached at the Geneva Conference ( 1954 ) . The `` Vietnam War '' ostensibly began as a civil war between feuding governments . Being Western-oriented and far less popular than Hồ Chí Minh 's northern rebellion , the South Vietnam government fought largely to maintain its governing status within the partitioned entity , rather than to `` unify the country '' as was the goal of the North . Fighting began in 1957 and with U.S. and Soviet-Chinese involvement would steadily escalate and spill over into the neighboring Indochinese countries of Cambodia and Laos.The Geneva partition was not a natural division of Vietnam and was not intended to create two separate countries . But the South government , with the support of the United States , blocked the Geneva scheduled elections for reunification . In the context of the Cold War , and with the recent Korean War as a precedent , the U.S. had feared that a reunified Vietnam would elect a Communist government under the popular Hồ Chí Minh . South Vietnam and its Western allies portrayed the conflict as based in a principled opposition to communism —to deter the expansion of Soviet-based control throughout Southeast Asia , and to set the tone for any likely future superpower conflicts . The North Vietnamese government and its Southern dissident allies ( NLF ) viewed the war as a struggle to reunite the country and to repel a foreign aggressor —a virtual continuation of the earlier war for independence against the French.After fifteen years of protracted fighting and massive civilian and military casualties , major direct U.S. involvement ended with the signing of the Paris Peace Accords in 1973 . Fighting between Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) forces against the dominant combined People 's Army of Vietnam ( PAVN ) and NLF forces would soon bring an end to the RVN and the war . With the Northern victory , the country was unified as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam ( SRV ) with a communist-controlled government based in the new capital Hanoi.This is just a brief summary .

If you are concerned about this , get a second opinion about your treatment.My notion is that if you do n't want to get pregnant , are sexually active , and want to avoid pain , its probably a good idea to take the birth control pills . Do n't smoke while you take them , though !",0

"need free advice/help with a resume. ? Look up resume examples online , find the types of `` jobs '' that appeal to you . Then match up what your talents are `` that you make you an asset to that particular position '' and convince the industry of what you have to offer in your resume . Many HR personnel do n't really care what you have done for your own interest in resumes , they are looking for what you have done that will be the best match to the position they are offering.Do some research , once you get a `` job '' with an industries , you can have a better feel for the position that interest you more from the inside of the company.I 'm not saying minimize your education , but you can leave out bits of experience that may not seem like an asset to them . Sometimes less is more . Then build on your qualifications and abilities , to advance to positions you find more interesting.There are auto resume builders available to walk you through how to put it all together in a professional manner , but using the format of resume examples on line should work well.I 'll also say try to keep the pages to a 2 page minimum , after that HR loses interest .",0

"Why does it hurt when I clean my ears ? For as long as I can remember cleaning my ears has been a painful experience . Even the slightest swipe with a q-tip hurts and itches .

"What kind of psychotherapy works the best ? The answer to your question is not easy . Some therapists use a limited approach ( ie . only interpersonal , focused on your relationships with others . ) In my opinion , CBT ( Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy ) is often successful if other approaches have failed . I am the maintainer of a portal called http : //health.wikispaces.com that is helping to answer ( I hope ) precisely these kinds of questions . It is Invitation-Only , so that it is not open to misinformation . ( people who can access the site can also edit it to add their own research , and experiences . ) The answer to your question is that depending on the reason you are seeking psychotherapy , different methods will work best.I think this is really a multistep question , so I am going to give you some sources of information and then ask you to come back for a follow-up.WebMD.com , using experts from the Cleveland clinic ( WebMD uses different sources , some of which are not very comforting ) , has a detailed article on psychotherapy I highly recommend : http : //www.webmd.com/content/article/60/67128.htmI am going to add to this . The first thing you should discuss with any therapist is what brought you to see them , and what your goals are , and also billing . Insurance will often cover up to a certain amount ; some therapists or social workers ( both do therapy to some degree ) work on a sliding pay scale ( ie . they negociate on rate you pay . ) http : //www.webmd.com/content/article/60/67128.htmMy local counselor here at Earlham College in Richmond , IN says that eclectic therapists are the best -- ie . the ones that can use any approach that seems helpful . ( She has a Masters in Social Work . ) Therapists vary . Some are really good and give you specific directed guidance . Techniques are being researched all the time . I just saw a really good article on 'resellience therapy ' which sounded really cool . ( If you are interested , I will provide you with the link . ) Let me know how I can best assist you ! -- Sam , journalist and healer of myself",0

"Has anyone heard of the `` sleep cure '' ? Supposedly it 's a means to lose a fair amount of weight over the course of a few days . You 're sedated and you wake up days later having lost 8-10 pounds . Real , or just some fictional fantasy that keeps cropping up in various books ? Sounds like some serious wishful thinking to me , combined with some misinterpreted observation.If you weigh yourself right before bed and then first thing in the morning , you will find that you 've lost a couple of pounds overnight . However , you 'll find by that evening that the weight is back.Makes it look like the best way to lose weight is to sleep , eh ? But it 's just water weight . You go to bed hydrated , you wake up dehydrated . Bummer.Sleeping for a few days may net you more weight loss , but some of that will be a loss in muscle ton , which will result in making it even harder to lose more weight and a good probability of gaining more weight than you lost.The best way to lose weight is to stop trying to lose weight . Instead , concentrate on improving your health . Yeah , yeah , exercise and eat right . * There 's a lot of details missing in those four words , but the gist is that any attempt to lose weight that does n't involve those activities are just ways of screwing your health for looks . The reason that I say stop trying to lose weight ? Weight is too complex a system to control reliably and any method that involves looking at a scale regularly will have a very good chance of just frustrating you to the point of giving up .",0
"Which American Military force is the best ? Air Force ? Army ? Marines ? Navy ? There is NO answer to this question , you can not say which force is the best . They all rely on each other to function.The army secures ports and airbases for the Navy and airforce to use . The navy transports the army , the airforce provides cover for the army . The army 's needs come by transport provided by the navy . The maries are top notch , but should not be bogged down watching a city , which is best left to a larger force such as the army . The coast guard uses less power to guard the coasts against minor threats that should not trouble the billion dollar warships of the navy ( which burn alot of fuel ) . Special forces can perform operations but can not take over a city and hold it . Every force has its job to do , none is `` better '' than another .",0

"whats the verdict ? If I have tablet w/ voice output and I wrote something falsely accusing a person behind a sheet of cloth , the person heard my false accusation via voice generation . How would he/she sue me , slander or libel ? What Are Defamation , Libel and Slander ? Generally speaking , defamation is the issuance of a false statement about another person , which causes that person to suffer harm . Slander involves the making of defamatory statements by a transitory ( non-fixed ) representation , usually an oral ( spoken ) representation . Libel involves the making of defamatory statements in a printed or fixed medium , such as a magazine or newspaper . Typically , the elements of a cause of action for defamation include : A false and defamatory statement concerning another ; The unprivileged publication of the statement to a third party ( that is , somebody other than the person defamed by the statement ) ; If the defamatory matter is of public concern , fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher ; and Damage to the plaintiff . In the context of defamation law , a statement is `` published '' when it is made to the third party . That term does not mean that the statement has to be in print . Damages are typically to the reputation of the plaintiff , but depending upon the laws of the jurisdiction it may be enough to establish mental anguish . Most jurisdictions also recognize `` per se '' defamation , where the allegations are presumed to cause damage to the plaintiff . Typically , the following may consititute defamation per se : Attacks on a person 's professional character or standing ; Allegations that an unmarried person is unchaste ; Allegations that a person is infected with a sexually transmitted disease ; Allegations that the person has committed a crime of moral turpitude ; While actions for defamation have their roots in common law , most jurisdictions have now enacted statutes which modify the common law . They may change the elements of the cause of action , limit when an action may be filed , or modify the defenses to an action for defamation . Some may even require that the defendant be given an opportunity to apologize before the plaintiff can seek non-economic damages .",0

The commoners spoke something related to the ancestor language of Dutch while the nobility spoke French . We kept the grammar of the native Anglo-Saxon tongue while adding huge amounts of French vocabulary.The result is recognizably English , while still sounding very different from what we speak today .

"how many taste buds do we use when we are tasting our food ? The types are SweetSaltySourBitterUmame ( alluded to above . From the Japanese word for `` savory , '' this responds to meaty tastes , ie high protein , and MSG . MSG is a food additive , Monosodium glutamate -- and glutamate if an amino acid , which are the building blocks for protein ) .And if you want the nitty-gritty , the idea behind taste buds are that various cells detect chemicals , and depending on the region of the brain that the cell is wired to , you know the taste . But not all receptors even of a given type are the same in their mechanism.Sweet reception is more than just a detection of -OH groups . There is a family of transmembrane g-protein coupled receptors called the T1Rs . The various tastes are sensed by various cells , differentiated by the type of receptors expressed in the cell.The sense of sweetness is detected by cells that express a combination of the T1R2 and T1R3 receptors . There is a quality about the sugars that trigger the perception of sweetness such that they bind to one of each of these receptors , creating a heterodimer and trigger the cascade that makes the cell fire . The umami sense is triggered likewise by a coupling of the T1R1 and T1R3 receptors . Some cells are known to express either only T1R2 or only T1R3 , and these have a low affinity detection of sugars ( or perhaps there is a yet unrecognized ligand for these cells ) .Sourness is the result of an acidic pH , with pH being the presence of hydronium ions ( H+ ) at a concentration greater than 10^-7 mole fraction . Sour is detected in sour-sensing cells by H+ ion blocking of the K+ channels , slowing K+ efflux and ultimately depolarizing the cell . Saltiness is detected by Na+ entering the Na+ channels and depolarize the cell.Bitterness is mediated by several distinct receptors that bind to various types of alkaline ( often amine ) molecules , in the T2R family . Bitterness is usually associated with potential toxins , so many receptors detect many things .",0

Like a daddy and his little girl , there is nobody who can come in between them until sweet sixteen when daddy 's cleaning the shotgun , while mothers want their sons to turn out to be men of honor that women will want while he still has respect .

"Why do women hate prenupts so much ? Marriage is about love , not finances . Prenps spell out terms that a divorce court would otherwise decide . Whe wealthier person usually requests a prenup of the less wealthy person before marriage , so usually the man requests of the woman . The prenup is usually drawn up by the lawyers of the wealther person and it tends to favor that person 's interests.The only reason the wealthier person would want a prenup is because they fear that they have more to lose in a divorce if they go through the court system , or they feel that they have a better negotiating position before the marriage starts than after it ends.This means that pretty much all the time the less wealthy person would fare better in divorce court then they would with a prenup.There are exceptions to this , such as wanting to protect some family heirloom or property that has been in someone 's family for hundreds of years or when the prenup is equally negotiated and each person has a thoroughly competent attorney with their interests in mind , but most of the time , the woman is asked to and does sign without counsel.I would say that women ( or the less wealthy person ) would object to a prenup for 2 reasons:1 ) They are bothered that the husband , his family , or his lawyers/staff are already thinking about divorce right before the marriage.2 ) They are upset that the husband wants to put the wife in a less favorable legal position should a divorce happen .",0

"Can someone show me in the New testament , where homosexuality is considered a sin ? All I can find , for a Christian to get to heaven , is that they accept Jesus as their Lord and Saviour . I think Man is adding on his own ideas because anything different scares him . the funny thing is , the original text of the OLD testament did n't say anything about homosexuality being a sin either . the part that 's commonly translated to say `` a man should not lie with another man as he would lie with a woman , that is detestable '' was originally mistranslated on PURPOSE when some homophobic church leaders got together to write the king james version ... the original hebrew text translates to `` a man should not lie with another man in a woman 's bed , that is unclean '' . so basically there 's no restriction on who can have sex with whom , just where they are allowed to do it .",0
"what should I do ? I feel like all of my prayers are'nt getting through to God , I 've backslide alot lately and I 'm scared that God dosent accept me any more . It seems like every thing I do is wrong , and conviction jumps on me and makes me feel so down . I feel like I 'm a million miles away from God . And all day long I 'm constanty thinking what I can do to please God . Can any one figure out what is wrong with me and my walk with Christ ? I just long for more of God to be in my life , and i can not stop thinking about Him , He 's on my mind all day long . We are called to rejoice and be glad ( Matt 5:11-12 ) . But we are also warned to be sober-minded ( Rom 12:3 ) . One of the most fearful verses I know that keeps me most sober is Matthew 7:21-23 : 21 “ Not everyone who says to me , ‘ Lord , Lord , ’ will enter the kingdom of heaven , but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven . 22Many will say to me on that day , ‘ Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy in your name , and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles ? ’ 23Then I will tell them plainly , ‘ I never knew you . Away from me , you evildoers ! ’ You can not DO anything to please God . He is pleased with perfection . Jesus is perfection , and died for your sins in your place . Do good because he loves you , not to pay your way back `` in '' . Grace is a gift not deserved . See Romans 7 : 14-20.Love the Lord your God with Everything-Trust in Him . The life of the Christian is not easy , it may in fact be hard , for some it has cost their lives , but the rewards for trust and obediance will be phenominal .",0

He epitomized determination ! Among many of his priceless quotations , he said : '' I may be slow , but at least I do n't walk backwards '' ... He was considered quite homely , and when he was accused of being two-faced during a debate with his opponent Steven Douglas , he replied , '' If I had another face , do you think I would be wearing this one ? '' ... ( The crowd loved it ! ) When his best General , Ulysses S. Grant , who at the time , was the only General winning any battles , was accused by his peers of being drunk all the time , he replied , `` Well , find out what he 's drinking , and send him another case of it , on me ! `` ... Lastly , he said , `` If I had one hour to cut down a tree , I would spend 45 minutes sharpening my axe '' ... Additionally , he had to bear the responsibilty of being at the center of our country 's most terrible War ... He wrote one , of what are considered to be the two greatest speeches in recorded history , the `` Gettysberg Address '' .

"What the meaning of `` CALIFORNIA `` ?

There is no agreement among scholars.The name California comes from a mythical Spanish island ruled by a queen called Califia that was featured in a Spanish romance ( `` Las Sergas de Esplandian '' ) written by Garcia Ordonez de Montalvo in 1510 .

"What is a blog ? I have head this word a lot of times but did not understand it . what does it mean ? A blog is a website for which an individual or a group frequently generates text , photographs , video or audio files , and/or links , typically ( but not always ) on a daily basis . The term is a shortened form of weblog . Authoring a blog , maintaining a blog or adding an article to an existing blog is called `` blogging '' . Individual articles on a blog are called `` blog posts , '' `` posts , '' or `` entries '' . The person who posts these entries is called a `` blogger '' . * Electronic communities existed before internetworking . For example the AP wire was , in effect , similar to a large chat room with `` wire fights '' and electronic conversations . Another pre-digital electronic community , amateur ( or `` ham '' ) radio , allowed individuals who set up their own broadcast equipment to communicate with others directly . Ham radio also had logs called `` glogs '' that were personal diaries made using wearable computers in the early 1980s . * Before blogging became popular , digital communities took many forms , including Usenet , e-mail lists and bulletin boards . In the 1990s Internet forum software , such as WebX , created running conversations with `` threads . '' Threads are topical connections between messages on a electronic `` corkboard . '' See `` Common terms , '' below . * Diarists kept journals on the Web : most called themselves online diarists , journalists , journallers , or journalers . A few called themselves escribitionists . The Open Pages webring contained members of the online-journal community . The first famous journaller was probably Justin Hall . * Other forms of journals kept online also existed . A notable example was game programmer John Carmack 's widely read journal , published via the finger protocol . * Websites , including both corporate sites and personal homepages , had and still often have `` What 's New '' or `` News '' sections , often on the index page and sorted by date .",0

"Are you a Calvinist or an Armenian ? Explain why and back up your position with Bible verse please ? Please only serious answers . Calvinist . [ Arminians ] ... say that the Augustinian tradition subordinates the love of God to the will of God ... But this is not what distinguishes the Augustinian tradition from the Arminian tradition . The distinction is between intensive and extensive love , between an intensive love that saves its loved ones , and an extensive love that loves everyone in general and saves no one in particular . Or if you really wish to cast this in terms of willpower , it 's the distinction between divine willpower and human willpower . Or , to put the two together , does God will the salvation of everyone with a weak-willed , ineffectual love , or does God love his loved ones with a resolute will that gets the job done ? The God of Calvin is the good shepherd , who names and numbers his sheep , who saves the lost sheep and fends off the wolf . The God of Wesley is the hireling , who knows not the flock by name and number , who lets the sheep go astray and be eaten by the wolf . Which is more loving , I ask ? - Steve HaysJohn 10:7-9 ( NKJV ) Then Jesus said to them again , `` Most assuredly , I say to you , I am the door of the sheep .

John 6:44 ( NKJV ) No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him ; and I will raise him up at the last day . John 6:45 ( NKJV ) It is written in the prophets , 'And they shall all be taught by God . ' Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me .

They will be your ... `` Bible '' , from now on ! * Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads . Also ognion + garlic . * Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits ( whenever possible , of course ) * If you really want a book , then check this out : The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook ( Win95/98 only ) . Read more about this e-book here.• Eat fish , chicken , beef , pork . ( preferences are in this order ) * If you are a vegetarian , then ignore this ! * Avoid fat meat• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day . Do n't EVER exclude bread from your diet ! • Snacks between meals ( if needed ) : apples , oranges , grepfruits and other NC fruits* Do n't cheat ... NO cookies , chips , candies , brownies etc ! * EVEN if they have `` low fat '' indication ... They might have low fat , yet they can have lots of CALORIES ! ! ! • About rice , potatoes , beans , [ xxx ] nuts , pastry , pasta ... you know ! * Do n't eat too much of those , at least during the first weeks of the diet . I 'm not a low carb addict , but I 've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities , especially when associated with other foods . * If you like them a lot , try and eat them like one meal . A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch ( never dinner ! ) , followed by a nice big apple . These rich starch foods are not good for dinner ! * At dinner time , chose mainly large mixed veggies salads ... with fish , lean meat or cheese ( if you are not a vegetarian ) . if u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it . no salt no nothing just plain . u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound . i heard that from a weight loss tape . the best drink is water or gatorade . thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo . if u want a macine . run with dumbells on a treadmill . u could do the rocky workout . but thats a new story . u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs1 ) It is not just the amount you eat , but what you eat . Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start . And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.2 ) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day . Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored . The other half of the time use weights , or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle `` burn '' . A gym is also an option , but I do n't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.3 ) Sleep well . To bed earlier and up earlier . Exercise in the morning when you wake up , not in the evening before bed . 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.4 ) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time . A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.That is a good place to start ... if you see good results , keep it up and modify to fit you ... if it does not , see a doctor AND a trainer Keep working out , drink water a lot , eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities , vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice , fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours , minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important , your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hoursthe most important thing is you do n't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you wantyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.comgood luck",0

"how many merders happen in new york each year ? 270 during last year.Murders were up slightly nationwide during the first six months of the year , and gang violence contributed to more killings in some of the nation 's largest cities , the FBI reported Monday . The number of murders rose 1.1 % nationwide , while overall violent crime declined 3.1 % . New York , Baltimore and Philadelphia were among the cities with an increase in homicides.The reasons for the increase in homicides vary by city . But experts said there has been a resurgence in gang activity in some of the cities . `` The question is , what are they fighting over ? '' said Kenneth Land , a Duke University sociology professor . `` Is it retribution homicides , or turf wars over drugs , or is it protecting turf ? `` The FBI 's six-month status report , based on reports from state and local law enforcement agencies , is widely viewed as an important indicator of national crime trends each year . The report also is considered a good predictor for the bureau 's year-end crime analysis.The report does not include raw totals for categories of crimes , only percentages . However , the FBI had figures for some large cities.The six-month totals for 2003 marked the third consecutive time the FBI has recorded a decrease in overall violent crimes but an increase in murders.The FBI said there were 308 murders from January to June of this year in New York City , compared with 270 during the same span last year . Philadelphia had 158 murders in the first half of this year — 20 more than in the first half of 2002 . Baltimore had 141 ( 14 more ) and Newark , N.J. , had 40 ( 13 more ) .Officials in Washington declared a crime emergency this summer during a spate of mostly gang-related violence.Overall , there were 4.3 % more murders in the Northeast part of the country during the first half of 2003 compared with last year . There also were slightly more homicides in the South and West ; only the Midwest showed a decrease ( -1.9 % ) .Many major cities outside the Northeast had fewer slayings , the report said . Los Angeles was down by 65 ; it had 258 . Detroit had 156 ( 28 fewer ) and Las Vegas dropped by six , from 70 to 64.Even with the national increase in murder , overall violent crime fell , as it has for most of the past decade . Other violent crimes besides murder that are measured are forcible rape , robbery and aggravated assault.Aggravated assaults were down 4.4 % . Forcible rapes dropped 4 % and robberies less than 1 % . Property crimes dropped by 0.8 % compared with the year before , although motor vehicle thefts were up slightly at 0.9 % . Other property crimes are burglary and larceny.The number of arsons — measured separately — dropped 10 % . Every part of the country saw fewer criminal fires set in the first half of 2003.The nation 's largest cities , those with more than 250,000 residents , saw violent crime drop slightly more than 4 % . The drop was most pronounced in rural areas , however , where violent crime fell 5.7 % . Violent crime was down 1.1 % in the suburbs.The rates for property crime changed very little in cities and suburbs in the first half of 2003 , but rural counties experienced a 2.5 % decrease.All regions of the country showed a decrease in motor vehicle thefts from January to June except the West , where they rose by 7.2 % .The FBI 's Uniform Crime Reports for the first six months of the year are based on information collected from 9,908 state and local law enforcement agencies .",0

Highly polished brass will not have an oxide coat to remove , so you can test it by immersing it in a solution with 2/3 vinegar and 1/3 hydrogen peroxide solution , and leave it for more than fifteen minutes . If it is brass and not gold , the solution will begin to turn green as the copper in the brass begins to dissolve . Again , gold will not react .",0

Its like a home , every home needs a specific address so that the postal system can forward postal mail . Earlier routers ( as the one that you have ) may not allow multiple IP allocation so you may not be able to use the router with multiple computers . However , what you can do is set up a home wireless computer .

"Teach me how to say mariah carey in french ? Jessica 's answer is essentially correct .

"Where do babies come from ? I mean i dont understand the process ... Well ... bear with me , because I may use some off-hand phrases and different words . And in the interest of education , do n't laugh when you hear some ... familiar words.There is a process in which it is done . The mature egg in the woman 's vagina is met with the mature sperm in the man 's testicles through intercourse . This is called fertilization . As soon as the egg is fertile , it becomes known as a zygote . The zygote is then transported to the womb , an organ in the female reproduction system that can expand to the size of a basketball , if the circumstances permit it to . The egg sticks to the side of the womb and grows , multiplying in cell count , fron 1 to 2 , to 4 , to 8 , and et cetra , for the first four months , also called the first Trimester . then it is called an Embyro . for the next trimester , the embyro will assume human characteristics , like arms and legs , and the heart will start beating . For the final trimester , the baby will gain muscle mass and fatty tissue , the tissue that will protect the new baby from harmful impact and harsh weather . After the final trimester , the baby can be given birth via vaginal birth , where the baby comes through the vagina of the mother ( a process that is , indeed , very painful ) , or Cisarean section , also known as C-section , where the mother is surgically cut open to remove the baby ( do n't worry , the doctors put her back together ) . The baby is then taken to a maternity ward for 3 days , so it can get used to the air and oxygen ( 12 months in water does make for a environmental shock ! ) . Then the mother is able to take home the baby , her new son or daughter .",0
"How to test a prophet in the LAST DAYS - if he or she is true or a false ? See , i 'm newly converted and I read that GOD WILL POUR OUT HIS SPIRIT IN THE LAST DAYS on all flesh ? Is he gon na pour it on an unbeliever too ? since God says in `` ALL FLESH '' , your children will dream dreams and your daughters and sons will prophesy before the terrible day of God Almighty . So now , JESUS also made mention of FALSE PROPHETS . And our church has a prophet exclusively of their own.There has to be true prophets also in the Last DAYS as well with false prophets ... So which one is which ... ( Hope it 's OK i ask too many questions : ) hi.. First of all , I would like to congratulate you for choosing the way of Christ.I 'll try to answer your question to the best of my ability.I believe that when God speaks about All fleshin Joel 2:28 `` And i shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh ; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , your young men shall see visions . `` He meant the believers or someone who is being prepared for the Lord 's works.If you check sub chapters before that verse , God talks about A call to repentance and the land refreshed.The Lord obviously speaks about the people who repent and refreshed into the new creation in Christ ( believers ) .Thus , I conclude that All flesh , in Joel 2:28 , means All believersThat 's why it is important to always read at least a chapter or two before and after the verse.For the bible works as a whole ; we should avoid reading bible verses by chopping it individually . If we do that , there is a chance for us to take the verse out of the original context . And , yes there are still prophets appointed by God.and as it is true that there are true prophets , there are also false prophets/teachers.and your question is How we can tell the true from the false one , right ? there are 3 steps for us to know that a prophet is a false one or not:1 . God says `` My People perish from the lack of knowledge . '' It is very important for us to read the bible and pray everyday to build a sweet and intimate relationship with God . And also sharpen our knowledge about God 's characters.We know that Jesus has warned us about the false prophets/ messiahs in Matthew 24:24-28 . So , when there are news about messiahs that come to deliver us from sin , we knew that we have to be careful with those fake messiahs . We know in our heart that Jesus Christ is our only messiah that no one comes to the Father without going trough Him.2 . From reading the bible everyday and become more and more alert and sensitive to God 's voice , we knew that the true prophet sent by God will NEVER contradict the bible.So , when a teacher/prophets come to you and said that he is the messiah or something like you should divorce your husband , we know immediately that this prophet is a false teachers and should be avoided.Remember ! the bible is the ultimate guide that you should use to check whether a prophet is false or not.when they go against the bible , do n't waste your time.Pack your things and go.. Do n't bother listening to them.3 . What if the prophet looks and sounds fine for now ... but in the future , he will finally shown his true self . how do you know that he 's not going to trap you in his web of lies . For we know that the devil is cunning and deceitful.Well , go and look in matthew 7 : 15-20.It is okay and even recommended to test those people.Do n't accept them immediately just because they said they are prophets.Do n't be rude to them , but keep your Spiritual alert system on all the time.Test the fruits and the labors . For the things that came from the Lord always bring forth peace and goodness.Take whatever good and biblical inside . but , disregard the weird teachings . Keep alert and pray all the time for the Holy Spirit to reveal the truth to you about those prophets . Hopefully that helps , In jesus name , Amen",0

"is a criminal justice a lawyer that goes to court and defends people ? is like what is the diference between pre law studies , criminal justice , law , advanced legal reaserch , coparative law and international law . Haha , no - criminal justice refers to the field of study that examines crime as a social phenomenon , and traditional focuses on the agents , procedures , and systems that societies create in order to deal with crime.Pre-law studies are just that ; they are tracks that some universities offer for those who want to go to law school and who may ( or may not ) know what area of law they want to get in to . From what I understand , these tracks usually consist of courses aimed at improving students ' oral and written communication skills , their critical/analytical thinking , and creativity . Most also provide a survey of the different kinds of law , as well as giving you a historical backdrop for the practice.Advanced legal research - I am not sure what you mean , but legal research in general refers to the process of digging up the legal matters surrounding some topic or issue . This is a complicated and tedious process , so I do n't know if legal research is ever NOT `` advanced . '' : - ) Comparative law studies laws between different countries ( e.g . British law versus Chinese law ) and between different legal systems ( e.g . common law versus civil law ) .International law studies the rules that govern conduct between independent states .

"Why does acidophilus have to be refrigerated ? What about the kinds that supposedly do n't have to be refrigerated ? And what 's up with enteric coating ? And do I ask too many questions ? Acidophilus needs to be refridgerated because it is a bacteria . Since it is a living organism , in order for it to stay alive , they have you bring it down to a temperature that basically `` immobilizes '' it so it does n't die . They do sell those that do n't have to be stored that way , but all the information i 've read suggests that they do n't really work the same as most of the bacteria are dead by the time you take them . The enteric coating prevents the bacteria in the pill from being released into your stomach and thus digested ( killed ) . Instead it passes into your intestines and is released there , which is where the acidophilus bacteria are meant to be living , so it is best that they reach there alive ! No , you do n't ask too many questions ... as long as they are valid .",0

"`` Shalom `` . most famous Jewish word in the world . A friend told me that behind this word ; there 's a story ? I mean some Jewish got an explaination . Its not a `` Jewish '' word , its Hebrew ( our language ) for 'peace ' . What sort of story do you mean ? It is one of the ways we greet each other .

'' or `` peace be among you '' , ( almost a question and statement at the same time ) and the appropriate response from the sentry would be `` aleichem shalom '' or `` among us , there is peace '' This lets the vistors know that everything is fine at the camp , and that they are welcome to enter the camp . This is how it was done back then , and that form of answering with the subjects reversed remains to be the appropriate greetingUpdate : Toda , toda . Beruch ti hiyeh !

"whats the most effective treatment to kill lice eggs ? killing the bugs has n't been the problem those eggs are.I just want her hair pretty and shiney again and for this problem gone for good .I know to wash everything and to spray bedding and furniture.Thanks The problem is that you ca n't kill the eggs . The nits are encased in a very strong type substance that can not be penetrated . The most important thing is to retreat the hair after 7 to 10 days and you HAVE to get all the nits out by hand or by comb . I find those plastic combs ineffective . I ordered a metal comb called medi comb from a dealer on ebay . It works the best but you will still need to hand pick some . They are such a pain ! Also using hair styling products ( after hair is nit/lice free ) daily helps prevent reinfestation from contant with others ( at school/bus/etc. ) . I also flat iron/or hot iron curl her hair at times or braid it . Anything that keeps it back or helps to kill those pests ! Also watch closely the friends they play with and if you see any kind of scratching check the child immediately and send them home to tell their parents if you find any nits or anything . Check over the ears and nape of the neck . Also they do make lice repellent spray that you can order ( search online ) it 's mostly tea tree oil , eucalyptus , geranium , and other essential oils mixed with water but it could help if your child is in close proximity of other children and lice is a reoccurring problem . Prevention is the best medicine .",0

"what 's with the bermuda triangle ? The Bermuda Triangle is a stretch of the Atlantic Ocean bordered by a line from Florida to the islands of Bermuda , to Puerto Rico and then back to Florida . It is one of the biggest mysteries of our time - that is n't really a mystery . The term `` Bermuda Triangle '' was first used in an article written by Vincent H. Gaddis for Argosy magazine in 1964 . In the article Gaddis claimed that in this strange sea a number of ships and planes had disappeared without explanation . Gaddis was n't the first one to come to this conclusion , either . As early as 1952 George X. Sands , in a report in Fate magazine , noted what seemed like an unusually large number of strange accidents in that region . In 1969 John Wallace Spencer wrote a book called Limbo of the Lost specifically about the triangle and , two years later , a feature documentary on the subject , The Devil 's Triangle , was released . These , along with the bestseller The Bermuda Triangle , published in 1974 , permanently registered the legend of the `` Hoodoo Sea '' within popular culture . Several books suggested that the disappearances were due to an intelligent , technologically advanced race living in space or under the sea . The only problem was that the mystery was more hype than reality . In 1975 a librarian at Arizona State University , named Larry Kusche , decided to investigate the claims made by these articles and books . What he found he published in his own book entitled The Bermuda Triangle Mystery-Solved . Kusche had carefully dug into records other writers had neglected . He found that many of the strange accidents were not so strange after all . Often a triangle writer had noted a ship or plane had disappeared in `` calms seas '' when the record showed a raging storm had been in progress . Others said ships had `` mysteriously vanished '' when their remains had actually been found and the cause of their sinking explained . More significantly a check of Lloyd 's of London 's accident records by the editor of Fate in 1975 showed that the triangle was a no more dangerous part of the ocean than any other . U.S. Coast Guard records confirmed this and since that time no good arguments have ever been made to refute those statistics . So the Bermuda Triangle mystery disappeared , in the same way many of its supposed victims had vanished . Even though the Bermuda Triangle is n't a true mystery , this region of the sea certainly has had its share of marine tragedy . Perhaps the best known one was the story of Flight 19 . The tale of Flight 19 started on December 5th , 1945 . Five Avenger torpedo bombers lifted into the air from the Navel Air Station at Fort Lauderdale , Florida , at 2:10 in the afternoon . It was a routine practice mission and the flight was composed of all students except for the Commander , a Lt. Charles Taylor . The mission called for Taylor and his group of 13 men to fly due east 56 miles to Hens and Chicken Shoals to conduct practice bombing runs . When they had completed that objective , the flight plan called for them to fly an additional 67 miles east , then turn north for 73 miles and finally straight back to base , a distance of 120 miles . This course would take them on a triangular path over the sea . About an hour and a half after the flight had left , a Lt. Robert Cox picked up a radio transmission from Taylor . Taylor indicated that his compasses were not working , but he believed himself to be somewhere over the Florida Keys ( the Keys are a long chain of islands south of the Florida mainland ) . Cox urged him to fly north , toward Miami , if Taylor was sure the flight was over the Keys . Planes today have a number of ways that they can check their current position including listening to a set of GPS ( Global Positioning Satellites ) in orbit around the Earth . It is almost impossible for a pilot to get lost if he has the right equipment and uses it properly . In 1945 , though , planes flying over water had to depend on knowing their st",0

Trying not to be prejudice ... ... but a great movie sex ... . they cant be the same , a movie affects you in a little way possible while sex is more of an intimate thing that you share with your partner are whoever you are with . So to compare movies and sex ... .i think thats a big nono ... .XoXome",0

"How do you like President Bush ? ? ? He 's a power hungry , cronyist puppet of the far right neocon movement . He 's a demagogue , and he is n't very smart . He thinks he 's above the law , he panders to the prevailing winds of evangelical Christianity even though the neoconservative movement stinks to Heaven of nihilism , egocentrism , atheism and cynicism.He is the choice of a party which tries to expound , at every opportunity , on the evils of big government and centralized social programs all while racking up a monsterous deficit on missile defense shields born of broken treaties . Upon breaking our nuclear proliferation treaties , we wonder why rogue nations in the rest of the world want to do the same . His spendthrift attitude is causing inflation , and it 's crowding much needed private investment out of our manufacturing sector . His failure to enforce the laws which keep the capitalist system of this country running have led to price gouging of fuels , and that 's compounding our economic troubles . Under his administration , we have made several cuts to energy subsidies for the poor ( which he promised not to do while campaigning ) , and in the face of his carefree attitude towards the illegal activities of the oil companies , people have frozen to death in their homes.The manufacturing in the military-industrial sector combined with a purely reactionary attitude towards environmentalism has led to a toxic level of perchlorates in the breast milk of almost ALL of the women tested for it . We ca n't even set up a control group because everyone is so laden with perchlorates . Perchlorates cause brain damage in nursing children.His budgets allocate federal funds for private , religious organizations.In violation of the due process of the law and our long held principles which prohibit unlawful search and seazure , he has the NSA spy on Americans and subpeonas search engines to find out what everyone in the country is searching for.He abandons science in favor of ideology . He refuses to heed the warnings of climatologists . His hostile attitude towards medicine and biology is threatening the very foundations of American industry , innovation and science . His cronies are trying to censor and suppress scientific journals which give sound evidence to something that should be intuitively obvious -- logging does n't help forests recover from forest fire.He was an alcoholic and a cokehead until he was 40 . His `` choice '' to become President was made when , according to him , he realized that he `` was 40 and wondering what to do with his life . '' He is in office only because Americans have strayed so far from their liberal founding principles that they would rather see a dynastic succession of aristocracy than a government of scholars and public servants.He abandoned Afghanistan , where the terrorists were and are , to take us to war in Iraq , where they are n't . He lied to do this . After doing that , his administration gave no-bid contracts to Halliburton , whose former CEO is now your vice-president . The price of doing this is that we are now unable to deal with a growing threat in Iran , and while only a few years ago we were berating the international community and the UN Security Council , the best we can now manage is to threaten to refer Iran to the UN Security Council.Under his administration , we have begun to use the CIA to fly people who are only suspected of something to old Soviet facilities where we torture them . We hold people for long periods of time without charging them with a crime.He pushed an energy bill through congress which relaxes the efficiency requirements for coal burning power plants . His reason ? To correct an impending energy crisis by making it worse . Companies wanting to build nuclear reactors are guaranteed a loan from the government to do so , they are no longer liable for nuclear accidents , and if their inspection process is halted for any reason , the government hands b",0

"What the mean of Valentines Day to a mankind ... ? is worth it ... ? Valentine 's Day falls on February 14 , and is the traditional day on which lovers in certain cultures let each other know about their love , commonly by sending Valentine 's cards , which are often anonymous . The history of Valentine 's day can be traced back to an obscure Catholic Church feast day , said to be in honor of Saint Valentine , are discussed below . The day 's associations with romantic love arrived after the High Middle Ages , during which the concept of romantic love was formulated.The day is now most closely associated with the mutual exchange of love notes in the form of `` valentines . '' Modern Valentine symbols include the heart-shaped outline and the figure of the winged Cupid . Starting in the 19th century , the practice of hand writing notes has largely given way to the exchange of mass-produced greeting cards . The Greeting Card Association estimates that , world-wide , approximately one billion valentine cards are sent each year , making the day the second largest card-sending holiday of the year behind Christmas . The association also estimates that women purchase approximately 85 percent of all valentines",0

Rev 13:5 reads : And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies ; and power was given unto him to continue forty [ and ] two months.Gaius is the only emporer before Nero that could possibly fit this description because his reign was from A.D. 37-41 Three years and ten months to be exact ; The bible mentioned 42 months which is three years and six months ...

"How people judge people ? do you judge people by looks , personality , way-of thinking ... Initially , people judge people by appearance and actions , because these are the first things that you can observe about someone . You can judge this up close or from a distance . People usually judge based on comparing another person to their own appearance , and how much the appearance differs from their own appearance.If someone takes the time to get to know someone , they will judge a person on `` deeper '' issues : intelligence , ways of spending time , ways of treating others , and beliefs . Of course , these again are perceived by the person that is doing the judging , and they 're usually compared to their own characteristics/beliefs.Should people judge people ? Yes , and no . It 's good to have standards that you expect of people , in terms of how you are treated , and standards of common decency . However , one should keep in mind that this world would be a boring place if we were all the same , and that everyone does not have the same experiences that you have . So , although judging is hard to avoid , you have to control what you do with your judgements . And it 's always good to reassess what you think of someone . Try to get to know people better .",0

"What is Artificial Reefs ? What is Artificial Reefs ? Can you give me some website about it ? An artificial reef is a reef created by man in places where reefs do not occur naturally.To enhance recreational fishing and sport diving opportunities in coastal waters , and to increase the amount of productive hard-bottom habitat available overall , man can participate ( with significant help from nature ) in the creation of additional man-made , or `` artificial '' reefs . This is accomplished by placing suitable long-lived , stable and environmentally safe materials ( usually steel or concrete ) on a selected area of ocean bottom.Once the material is in place it acts in the same way that naturally occurring rock outcroppings do in providing hard substrate necessary in the basic formation of a live-bottom reef community . Since there is nothing artificial about the myriad of living organisms which eventually colonize and inhabit almost every square inch of these man-made structures , the term artificial reef may really be somewhat misleading . When properly designed , located and constructed with an adequate quantity of stable and durable substrate , man-made reefs can be equally as productive in theory as naturally occurring hard- bottom habitats , limited only by the life-span of the materials utilized . Given the variety of materials currently in use on many artificial reefs , some reef structures in place now could remain productive for the next one to five hundred years .",0

An American Marines rather tastless `` shake and fry '' comment indicates that this was the case and therefore violates the CW treaty.As an ex-military Officer I do n't have too many problems with using whatever tool is required to win with the least casualties to my own people . What we have to watch is loosing the moral high ground and becoming the same as the enemy we fight .",0

"Where do EBAY powersellers get their merchandise ? It has to do with being at the right place and at the right time . Many of the big powersellers have had access to low cost products in several ways . 1 . Discontinued products . Many times , a product line gets discontinued with a newer model . The older model becomes very difficult to sell . Someone comes in and agree to buy the whole lot for a fraction of the manufactor 's price . It helps the retailer keep their products fresh and minimizes loss.2 . Refurbished . Manufactor refurbishes a product and sells it in a white box for a fraction of the price of the original product sold in the retail box . Manufactors get the products from the retailers as a returned item and has to credit the retailer . This gives the manufactor an opportunity to recover the loss . Some powersellers established a business relationship with the manufactor to purchase those refurbished products.3 . Retailer Returns . A powerseller may have signed a deal with a retailer that says they 'll pay cents on the dollar for everything the retailer gets returned.So lets say retailer buys something for $ 10 from the manufactorer and sells it to the consumer for $ 25 . Items will always get returned either damaged , unopened , or opened and for any variety of reasons . If the retailer returns it to the manufactorer , they may get a credit of about $ 1 or $ 2 . The powerseller buys the products for $ 3 , $ 4 , or $ 5 . Taking the chance , they know that at least a minimum % of the products to be working and can sell the working products.4 . Directly from the manufactor or distributor . As more products you buy in bulk , the greater the discount the manufactor give the buyer .",0
how does a flourescent lamp gives us light ? 1.First of all it is cheaper then the standard lightbulb . I use it all the time instead of the standard filament bulbs that use the wire to heat up . 2 . It uses your power ( electricity ) to move Mercury vapor in argon or neon.3 . Did you know that that type of light does not stay on steady ? It makes many many blinks too fast for your eye to catch . I tried experimenting with using a `` fan '' . Only way to fully see the blinks very well is when it is reaching end of its life.4 . A modified version you could use to grow plants . But it is not your standard `` flourescent '' light.You could try ( likely ) to check howstuffworks because if I would explain would run out of space.Word of caution as always : Never attempt to open one flourescent up it will explode . It will release Gas and could be more dangerous if you break it near yourself then a standard bulb ! I LOVE IT we have brains on Q /A today ! Now that could be used on the message boards too .,0

"What are the problems the No Child Left Behind Act has presented ? The biggest problem is that it makes teachers focus on teaching to a test rather than just teaching . Knowing how to take the test is more important , under this system , than knowing what is on it . Further , the act has been severely underfunded . The act requires more qualified teachers ( aka ones with more education ) , but more education means higher pay , which is something many school districts ca n't do.I think more importantly than any of those problems , there 's the issue of how to measure improvement . Under the act each class is compared to the previous class , meaning this year 's 2nd grade is compared to last year 's 2nd grade . Now , obviously comparing different groups of kids is fundamentally unfair . People do n't like to admit it , but some people have different base levels of intelligence . Certainly everyone who is not developmentally challenged should be able to pass high school reasonably , but to fault a school and its teachers simply because one class is , on average , not quite as smart is the most asinine thing I can think of . Thankfully the DOE is starting a pilot program of comparing student scores across their school careers ( comparing last year 's 2nd grade scores to this year 's 3rd grade scores ) . That is obviously the better way to do it , but making the switch is going to cost money , something the act has failed to provide .",0

If you know the attenuator resistor and output impedance values , you just apply Ohm 's Law to calculate the input/output ratio .

So , try to think back to the time right after your last period ( before this one ) . If you were traveling a lot , or dealing with a lot of stressful stuff , maybe that 's the reason . I would say , just wait a few months and as long as you get back on a mostly normal schedule , do n't worry about it .",0
"What are the basic differences that separate Roman Catholicism and Protestantism ? I think a major difference is that Protestants believe that you can not get to heaven on your own merit , that you must confess your sins and trust in Jesus as God 's son who died as a sacrifice for your sins ; they believe that you can not avoid sin on your own , that you must rely on Jesus as a redeemer , but that you will want to do good works out of appreciation for God 's salvation through Jesus . I think that Roman Catholics believe that you must acknowledge that Jesus is God 's son , but also that you have to do good works to get to heaven.From what I understand , Protestants believe that you can/should directly ask Jesus to forgive your sins , while Roman Catholics believe that you can/should confess your sins to a priest , who will in turn be your `` intercessor '' to Jesus/God . Also , Protestants believe that only Jesus/God/Holy Spirit are holy and that the Virgin Mary ( Jesus ' mother ) or other `` saints '' are just regular people , saved by God 's grace/Jesus . Roman Catholics believe that the Virgin Mary and other `` saints '' are holy , and can be prayed to for miracles or forgiveness.For the most part , I think that Protestants believe that when you die , you will go to heaven or hell . Roman Catholics believe that you might go to purgatory ( where you are `` purged '' of your sins before you get into heaven ) . I think there 's also `` Limbo , '' which is a place where babies can go if they have n't been able to comprehend the choice between heaven and hell.There are , of course , a lot of different divisions within Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths , so a lot of these are generalizations , and will not necessarily apply to a Protesant or Roman Catholic person 's personal beliefs .",0

"definition of discovery teaching approach ? The discovery method is a teaching technique that encourages students to take a more active role in their learning process by answering a series of questions or solving problems designed to introduce a general concept . In this teaching approach , the instructor guides the student ’ s thought process by posing a series of questions whose responses would lead to the understanding of a concept before it is explicitly stated . “ Children act as detectives as they solve concept-attainment activities in stimulating learning environments . In doing so , they place a newly introduced object in a category that they have previously discovered or identified. ” This teaching method is believed to increase retention of material because the student organizes the new information and integrates it with information that has already been stored .",0

"compare and contrast kant and machiavelli ? Hmm , does someone have a politcal theory midterm coming up ? Kant was largely a predecessor to Marx/Engels and was critisizing the same social structures they work and their inevitable ends of ruin . Machiavelli on the other hand was an advocate of the totalitarian ideal . Force makes right , but the quite `` The ends justifies the means . `` , in itself is not correct . Even Niccolo would not entirely agree with that . Their deep philophies are much to deep to get into because they were largely addressing different periods in political history . Machiavelli was witnessing Roman decline and revolution , while Kant was witnessing the rise of the industrial revolution and its impacts upon the masses . Is there a specific topic you were intrested in like free will ? social revolution or something ?",0

"How can I get more bids on my eBay auctions ? I am trying to attract more bids to my eBay auction of World Coins . I am a Square Trade seller . I use scans . I have 99.9 % positive feedback . Any suggestions to improve on the number of bids per item ? I 've found that one of the best ways to maximize the number of bids is to start your auction with a lower price . Consider .99 cents ; it will generally bump up the total number of bids , but will also cost you less to list the auction ! As for when you start and end your auctions , you really have to consider your audience and research what time of day other folks are getting the best prices for their wares . I try to start most auctions on Sunday night at 6 PM Pacific time ( eBay 's default time is Pacific time ) . However , most of what I sell is bought by people here in the states -- if you have more international buyers , then a different time might work better for you.Hope this helps !",0

Once you have a good idea what the jobs are really like ( and they are almost never what you imagine them to be ) then you can settle into a career . But always remember that you should love your job , if you hate it , you need a different job ( not necessarily a different career , just a different job ) .

"I ve a very severe short sightedness which affects just an eye and doctors say glasses wo n't help . pls advice The doctor says the use of a glasses is out of the question since just one eye is affected and a thick lens according 2 him will affect d other eye and moreso i will ve a multiple vision Well , I do n't know the specifics of your problem , but I can offer a bit of an explanation of what your doctor said . Glasses would n't help you because the lenses for each eye would be dramatically different . Since you 're very near-sighted in the one eye , you would need a very strong lens that would ultimately make the image on your retina much smaller than the image on your other retina . If these two images are very different sizes , your brain ca n't put them together into one image and you see double . If both of your eyes can be corrected to 20/20 vision , I would ask your doctor ( or another doctor , if you 'd like a second opinion ) if LASIK is an option for you . This could possibly bring your very near-sighted eye close enough to the other eye so that your brain would be able to make a single image .",0

"is this bird flu REALLY that dangerous ? or just a fad ? i mean ... u hear researchers are terrified by 3 deaths in one country 4 in another . malaria kills millions especially in africa . The bird flu is n't really dangerous now , but it has potential to become a serious threat . The main problem with bird flu is its high resistance to antibiotics . And everytime one of those few people with it are treated , there is the chance that new strains resistant to that treatment will develop . The main difference between bird flu and malaria is that we generally have malaria isolated in africa , with few exceptions , where as we dont really know how far bird flu has spread . There 's also vaccines to prevent malaria and drugs to treat it.Also , bird flu hits and kills a person very fast.. typically wthin 3-4 days . The potential of the bird flu has been compared The spanish flu back in 1919 that killed 50-100 million people in a 1 year time span .

"Who discovered the planet Pluto and how did it get its name ? Pluto was discovered by the astronomer Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona on February 18 , 1930 . In the matter of Pluto the discretion of naming the new object belonged to Lowell Observatory and its director , Vesto Melvin Slipher , who , in the words of Tombaugh , was `` urged to suggest a name for the new planet before someone else did '' . The name retained for the planet is that of the Roman god Pluto , and it is also intended to evoke the initials of the astronomer Percival Lowell , who predicted that a planet would be found beyond Neptune . The name was first suggested by Venetia Burney , at the time an eleven-year-old girl from Oxford , England . Over the breakfast table , one morning her grandfather , who worked at Oxford University 's Bodleian Library , was reading about the discovery of the new planet in the Times newspaper . He asked his granddaughter what she thought would be good name for it . Venetia thought that as it was so cold and so distant it should be named after the Roman God of the underworld . Professor Herbert Hall Turner cabled his colleagues in America with this suggestion , and after favourable consideration which was almost unanimous , the name Pluto was officially adopted and an announcement made by Slipher on May 1 , 1930 .",0

"My bad habit : chewing my fingers . What is the best way to stop it and break the habit ? I 've been chewing my fingers ever since I was in elementary . Nowadays , even at 20 - I occasionally chew on them when I get a little nervous or jittery , but I do n't even realize that . It 's getting a bit annoying and embarassing ... how do I stop it ? HMMMM some very interesting answers here that I like ... .Such as the rubber band idea . I would recomend that idea and see if that helps . If not ... .First of all as a former thumb sucker and smoker I understand oral fixations ( I quit the thumb thing a 12 started smoking at 13 and just quit that at 22 , about two months ago ) . Even now you will usually catch me with a touthpick , rubber band , bottle lid , pencils , or other item in my mouth . I have seriously cut back the habbit and consiously have to make efforts not to do it . Here are some suggestions . First of all peppers contain volitale oils that can chemically burn skin so avoid those . Purchase some alum powder and mix the powder with a few drops of water ( Enough to make a slightly runny paste . ) and soak your fingers in it . Alum is very , unpleasantly bitter and will immediately make your mouth pucker . Some people like lemon juice or tobasco so using those items usually does n't work because the taste is n't very strong . Next put up sticky notes at the places you are most like to do this . Repeating to yourself that this is bad trains your mind to avoid doing it subconsciously . If you are like me you also put your hand on your face ( or chin in hand , whatever ) . You can curb this action as well by improving your posture . Freeze yourself the next time you catch yourself doing this ( or finger chewing ) and analyze how you are sitting . Usually slumped with your elbow on the table or with your elbow semi supported by your stomach or chest . If you start improving your posture then you will become less inclined to hold your arm up unsupported for very long . I am using an exercise ball for a computer chair right now to retrain my posture . My doctor recomended it and I highly agree , I 've already noticed a difference.Cheer up though . Some studies say that finger chewing , nail biting , and other oral fixations are all signs of higher intelligence . It is believed that the brain in these cases works so fast that it actually gets bored or is somehow unstimulated . By controlling physical movement while mental processes such as reading or talking occur your brain is exercising itself and making you smarter and faster by training itself to multitask.Oh and a side note . Many people often notice that they chew nails/fingers in response to nervousness . The sucking/chewing motion is deeply ingrained in our most primitive side as being calming . When we are babies and we recieve food ( suckle ) subconciously we are aware of being protected by our mothers . The sucking/chewing motion along with full belly releases seratonin in the child inducing pleasure and happiness . In response to certain stresses adults will ocassionally do the same thing for the chemical calm it can induce , without even thinking about it . I tend to do this in the store especially when I ca n't find something . I feel lost and confused and tend to stick the tip of one or more finger in my mouth while looking .",0

I 've seen many people claim it 's too long and that they should remove stuff before they reach Skull Island . I think the opposite , some of the special effect sequences ( which were great ) could be removed . The story of this movie is more about the relationship between the characters and the ape , not so much an action flick.I can see why Jackson did it that way though . For a movie to be financially successful it generally has to do well in the US market . The US movie-goer is very hooked on action and special effects , so that had to be in there along side the emotional story in order for it to be liked in the US .",0

Did they sew his mouth shut ? Did he break both hands ? Does he have any friends who could have called you , or at least emailed you during this time ? It sounds like an excuse to me . Most likely , he found someone else some place and when that did n't work out , he 's back online with you . That sucks , but if he were serious about you , he would have thought up a way to contact you .

This development is most obvious in the private , the semi-private and the public sectors and involves the local , regional , national , transnational , and global levels within these sectors . The main theme of the Organisational Cybernetics Research Group concerns the relationship between system theory and organisations . There are two research aims : fundamental en instrumental .",0

"why is probability sampling prefered over non probability sampling ? Probabilty sampling allows you to perform stastistical analysis , such as regression , correlation and so on . They can also be crafted to be extremely representative of the population . You can also construct confidence intervals ( for example : 54 % of Americans support the bill with a margin of error of +/- 2 % ) . You can also use stastitical methods to prove casality or other relationships . Non probability sampling can not be used with stastical analysis , thus we can have no margin or error , correlation , etc . However , given a sufficiently large sample size , non probability sampling can still be useful for getting a 'pulse ' of the total population .",0
"whats the origin of HIV/AIDS ? It is now generally accepted that HIV is a descendant of a Simian Immunodeficiency Virus because certain strains of SIVs bear a very close resemblance to HIV-1 and HIV-2 , the two types of HIV.HIV-2 for example corresponds to SIVsm , a strain of the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus found in the sooty mangabey ( also known as the green monkey ) , which is indigenous to western Africa.The more virulent strain of HIV , namely HIV-1 , was until recently more difficult to place . Until 1999 , the closest counterpart that had been identified was SIVcpz , the SIV found in chimpanzees . However , this virus still had certain significant differences from HIV.It has been known for a long time that certain viruses can pass between species . Indeed , the very fact that chimpanzees obtained SIV from two other species of ape shows just how easily this crossover can occur . As animals ourselves , we are just as susceptible . When a viral transfer between animals and humans takes place , it is known as zoonosis.Below are some of the most common theories about how this 'zoonosis ' took place , and how SIV became HIV in humans : The 'Hunter ' Theory The most commonly accepted theory is that of the 'hunter ' . In this scenario , SIVcpz was transferred to humans as a result of chimps being killed and eaten or their blood getting into cuts or wounds on the hunter . Normally the hunter 's body would have fought off SIV , but on a few occasions it adapted itself within its new human host and become HIV-1 . The fact that there were several different early strains of HIV , each with a slightly different genetic make-up ( the most common of which was HIV-1 group M ) , would support this theory : every time it passed from a chimpanzee to a man , it would have developed in a slightly different way within his body , and thus produced a slightly different strain.An article published in The Lancet in 20043 , also shows how retroviral transfer from primates to hunters is still occurring even today . In a sample of 1099 individuals in Cameroon , they discovered to ten ( 1 % ) were infected with SFV ( Simian Foamy Virus ) , an illness which , like SIV , was previously thought only to infect primates . All these infections were believed to have been acquired through the butchering and consumption of monkey and ape meat . Discoveries such as this have lead to calls for an outright ban on bushmeat hunting to prevent simian viruses being passed to humans.The Oral Polio Vaccine ( OPV ) theory Could production of the oral polio vaccine have contributed to the spread of HIV ? Some other rather controversial theories have contended that HIV was transferred iatrogenically ( i.e . via medical experiments ) . One particularly well-publicised idea is that polio vaccines played a role in the transfer.In his book , The River , the journalist Edward Hooper suggested that HIV could be traced to the testing of an oral polio vaccine called Chat , given to about a million people in the Belgian Congo , Ruanda and Urundi in the late 1950s . To be reproduced , live polio vaccine needs to be cultivated in living tissue , and Hooper 's belief is that Chat was grown in kidney cells taken from local chimps infected with SIVcmz . This , he claims , would have resulted in the contamination of the vaccine with chimp SIV , and a large number of people subsequently becoming infected with HIV-1.However , in February 2000 the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia ( one of the original places that developed the Chat vaccine ) announced that it had discovered in its stores a phial of polio vaccine that had been used as part of the program . The vaccine was subsequently analysed and in April 2001 it was announced4 that no trace had been found of either HIV or chimpanzee SIV . A second analysis5 confirmed that only macaque monkey kidney cells , which can not be infected with SIV or HIV , were used to make Chat . While this is just one phial of many , most have taken its existence to mean that the OPV vacc",0

"Though electron affinity of fluorine is greater than flourine , Flourine acts as a better oxidising agent.Why ? I am assuming you are talking about fluorine and chlorine . But electron affinity deals only with the atoms ability to accept an electron . Oxidation deals with interactions between atoms . Fluorine being smaller has more atoms that are close to the atom being oxidized and thus greater charge density around the atom it 's oxidizing . Electron affinity deals only with electrons and no atoms thus electron repulsion of the smaller fluorine orbitals cause a decrease in electron affinity when compared to the larger atom of chlorine .

"what are tropical deserts ? A tropical desert consists of barren land over which rainfall is too limited to support vegetation . So why are such desolate and hostile places , like deserts , important to study ? Firstly , desert studies help us predict possible future changes to the environment and how to avoid damaging it . In his book The Desert of Southeast Arabia , Ken Glennie takes us on a journey back in time to when Arabia was a much greener place , and he explains how global climate made it so barren.Secondly , in many parts of the world , such as Oman , Saudi Arabia , Europe ’ s North Sea and the United States , hydrocarbons are found in ancient dune sand reservoirs . Can we unravel the depositional and stratigraphical intricacies of these ancient gas- and oil-bearing reservoirs by studying modern deserts ? Ken pioneered the answer to this question with his studies of both modern deserts and the reservoirs of the Permian Rotliegend Red Beds of northwest Europe . Ken started writing this book 10 years ago for students ; this is one reason for the extensive Glossary at the back . After many modifications and revisions , his book now provides a different perspective to a well-known topic . Its simplicity , detailed descriptions and illustrations will undoubtedly appeal to students , desert travelers and scientists . Of great value , especially when used in conjunction with studies on the ground , are the satellite images ( Landsat ) seen here in spectacular colour . None of these images , however , can replace seeing the desert rocks and sediments first hand . In this book , Ken shares his vast knowledge of the Arabian Desert , and exquisite collection of photos taken on the ground and from the air .",0

"What can be done to prevent early ejaculation ? Natural Ejaculation Control Technique is a process where breathing techniques are combined with meditative efforts to stop premature ejaculation . How to practice : [ 1 ] Relax and control your breathing - inhaling and exhaling normally . Keep your eyes loosely closed . Put your tongue against the palate . Focus your mind between your eyebrows at the center of your forehead . [ 2 ] Inhale through your nose deeply at intervals of 2-5 seconds until you can feel your abdomen expand , maximizing the capacity of your lungs . Now , focus your mind to the center of your body , directly towards your navel . [ 3 ] Hold your breath and move your expanded abdomen downward by contracting your upper abdomen . As pressure gradually builds up against the bladder and the prostate gland , shift your mental focus to the prostate area . * Step 3 is the most important step during intercourse – it requires that you hold your breath for as long as possible while applying pressure to the bladder and prostate area . This will partially block sensitivity to the penis , allowing you to last longer and control ejaculation . [ 4 ] Contract your anus by clenching . Then exhale air slowly out of the mouth , shifting concentration once again towards the center of your forehead . * You should feel hot energy rising from the prostate area along the spinal cord to your head.Repeat this cycle several times . But remember , when using the anal clenching method during intercourse , your inhalations and contractions of the abdomen should coincide with your sexual thrusting motions.Although , this might seem difficult at first , with just a little practice ( alone or with a partner ) , you ’ ll soon master it .",0

".SINCE CUSTOMERS KNOWN THEIR NEED AND WANTS THERE IS NO NEED FOR MARKETING DISCUSS ? Lets assume customers know all the products available in the market place . Most often there exists similar or substitute products in the market for example the chocolate market , Cadburys vs Nestle or in the soft drinks market Coca Cola vs Pepsi Cola or the car market . How would a potential buyer choose what brand to buy since it ’ s the same product ? To answer this question we must think in marketing terms such as the 4 p ’ s which are product , price , place and promotion . Price communicates a lot about the product such as , expensive means that the product is of the highest quality . Or cheap which can say – buy lots of me but don ’ t give it to your loved ones as a birthday present . Promotion is used to get customers to hear about the product and get them to try it . Product promotion is a strategy used to increase sales , increase product/brand awareness or get rid of stock . A product promotion could be a BOGOF ( buy one get one free ) , by one get second half price , money off coupons , etc . These strategies are used to get customers to buy more of your product or simply try it for the first time.Marketing is the process of exchanging products or the art of persuading people to buy your product . I said exchange because a customer will exchange money for the product they are buying , with so many me too products in the market place a business has to do all it can to convince customers that their product is better than the competition for whatever reason , that ’ s the art of Marketing . Coming up with the right products , setting the right prices , selling the product in the best and most convenient places ( having the product available for purchase ) , communicating the product to the public and convincing customers that your product is better then the competition is the art of selling .",0

"Why did the German government introduce Submarine warfare ? NO SPAM PLZ ! I presume you mean `` unrestricted '' submarine warfare.The short answer was to win the war . A better answer was because the English blockade of of Germany had the effect of starving the German populace of both food and resources.During WW1 , the British Navy was the most powerful force in the world . The German surface Navy could not hope to be an effective counter to it , so Germany had to resort to tactics other than traditional surface conflict . Submarines or Unterseebooten ( U-Boats ) were one means employed by the Germans . U-Boats were the `` Stealth Bombers '' of thier day . They could sneak up on surface ships undetected , and sink them with torpedoes.Germany 's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was originally instituted to combat the overwhelming superiority of the English Navy , but when they started sinking un-armed vessels with other nations peoples on board ( specifically Americans ) this helped draw America into the war . When the American 's arrived , it tipped the balance in favor of the allies ultimately losing the war for Germany .",0

"Who is Hosni Mubarak 's successor in ruling Egypt ? it is not really clear . the egyptian parliament nominates a single candidate , who is then confirmed by a referendum vote ( which is typically a massively-rigged election ) . egypt has been moving to democratize lately , but it looks to be a slow process and mubarak will likely not let much power slip from his hands.the economist seems to think that mubarak has been preparing his son , Galal Mubarak , to take over before he dies or steps down . however this has been met with public disapproval and it is not really certain just who would take over . if mubarak were to suddenly die , it would probably be a time of crisis in egypt that could either lead to a more democratic society or possibly civil war .",0

"Why is it that RICH Americans walk free from a trial but POOR ones go to jail or to Death Row ?

Conviction rates at trial used to be over 90 % , the rates have been falling and in some major metropolitan areas are down in the 65 % - 70 % range . The big differences are ( 1 ) the big celeb trials make the papers and ( 2 ) 80 to 90 % of the 'poor ' plea guilty to something and do not go to trial.The two big celeb trials , OJ and Blakely are especially unique in that the juries were stupid , stupid , stupid . And in the OJ case , at least , the DAs were incredibly inept . Of course , it was not the jurors fault that they were stupid . They were picked because each one claimed to have no opinion , which meant they had no connection to current events . In the OJ case they also had to be locked up in a hotel for the duration , which meant that the jurors had either no jobs or dead end jobs and no family or social life . Further , with the massive publicity and cameras all around , the jurors got the idea that they were really in a TV show , such as Law & Order or CSI , where the obvious suspect is never the real criminal and all loose ends are tied up before the credits roll . A real trial , like real life ends up with loose ends , and 99 % of the time the obvious suspect did do it .",0

"what is the begining of israel and palastine conflict ? why could n't it be stopped ? Complex problems usually do n't have simple answers ( like 'they tried to throw the Palestinians out ) .For over 3,000 years , Jews have held the Land of Israel to be their homeland , both as a Holy Land and as a Promised Land . The Land of Israel holds a special place in Jewish religious obligations , encompassing Judaism 's most important sites — including the remains of the First and Second Temple , as well as the rites concerning those temples . [ 2 ] Starting around 1200 BCE , a series of Jewish kingdoms and states existed intermittently in the region for over a millennium . Recent archeological evidence suggests that the kingdoms of King David and King Solomon may have existed . [ 3 ] Under Babylonian , Greek , Roman , Byzantine , and ( briefly ) Sassanian rule , Jewish presence in the province dwindled due to mass expulsions . In particular , the failure of the Bar Kochba Revolt against the Roman Empire resulted in widescale expulsion of Jews . It was during this time that the Romans gave the name Syria Palaestina to the geographic area , in an attempt to erase Jewish ties to the land . The Mishnah and Jerusalem Talmud , two of Judaism 's most important religious texts , were composed in the region during this period . The Arabs conquered the land from the Eastern Roman Empire in 638 CE . The area was ruled by various Arab states ( interrupted by the rule of the Crusaders ) before becoming part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517.Throughout the centuries , the size of the Jewish population in the land fluctuated widely . Circa 1881 , in the region approximating present-day Israel , the Jewish population numbered approximately 20–25,000 of a total population of 470,000 . [ citation needed ] Since 1844 , in Jerusalem the Jews have constituted the largest of several ethno-religious groups . [ citation needed ] By 1896 , they were an absolute majority of the populationThe rise of Nazism in 1933 led to a fifth wave of Aliyah . The Jews in the region increased from 11 % of the population in 1922 to 30 % by 1940 . The subsequent Holocaust in Europe led to additional immigration from other parts of Europe . By the end of World War II , the number of Jews in Palestine was approximately 600,000.In 1939 , the British abandoned the idea of a Jewish national home , and abandoned partition and negotiations in favour of the White Paper of 1939 , which limited Jewish immigration and restricted purchase of land by Jews . Its other stated policy was to establish a system under which both Jews and Arabs were to share one government . The plan was never fully implemented because of a combination of resistance from the Jews and Arabs and Britain 's pre-occupation with Europe and World War II . However , the White Paper guided British policy until the end of the term of their Mandate . As a result , many Jews fleeing to Palestine to avoid Nazi persecution and the holocaust were intercepted and returned to Europe . Two specific examples of this policy involved the ships Struma and Exodus [ 4 ] . These attempts by Jews to circumvent the blockade and flee Europe became known as Aliya Beth.In 1947 , following increasing levels of violence by militant groups together with unsuccessful efforts to reconcile the Jewish and Arab populations , the British government decided to withdraw from the Palestine Mandate . The UN General Assembly approved the 1947 UN Partition Plan dividing the territory into two states , Jewish and Arab , giving about half the land area to each state . Jerusalem was planned to be an international region administered by the UN to avoid conflict over its status.Immediately following the adoption of the Partition Plan by the UN General Assembly ( on November 29 , 1947 ) , the Arab leadership rejected the plan and launched a guerilla war that included attacks on Jewish civilians . The Irgun Tsvai Leumi retaliated with attacks on Arabs , including Arab civilians.On May 14 , 1948 , before the expiry of the British Mandate of Palestine at midnight of May 15 , 1948 ,",0
"Why does an apple is refered to a kid or learning ? I sometimes see an apple along with a student or a kid . From wikipedia : '' In the United States , Denmark and Sweden , an apple ( polished ) is a traditional gift for a teacher . This stemmed from the fact that teachers during the 16th to 18th centuries were poorly paid , so parents would compensate the teacher by providing food . As apples were a very common crop , teachers would often be given baskets of apples by students . As wages increased , the quantity of apples was toned down to a single fruit . `` So I guess it was so common that it become a symbol for teaching and learning .",0

"What is the difference between a desktop and a workstation ? I am thinking about alienware , any suggestions. ? I need lots of computing power w/ the option of using for media/games . Systems about $ 1500 . There may have been a distinction between a desktop and a workstation in the past but there 's only a faint gray line that differentiates the two today . A workstation can do anything a consumer desktop can and vice versa . So essentially , they mean the same thing.If you ask Dell or Alienware , however , they 'll probably say workstations are for business and desktops are for consumers . For computer manufacturers , a workstation usually means some of the latest technology . They tend to have SATAII , beefier minimum RAM than deskops , and stronger processors for their `` base systems '' . Of course , you could always configure a base consumer desktop with all of that , so the distinction is moot.If you look carefully , though , there may be one or two small differences . Workstations may prefer to use more expensive ECC RAM . Their video cards may be ISV-certified and use `` workstation-level '' video graphic cores ( nVidia Quadro instead of GeForces , ATI FireGL instead of Radeons ) . And almost always , their starting configurations tend to use a CDROM ( cause , you know , why would you need a DVD burner for work ? ! ) .Again , all of this can be changed . You can buy a workstation with a DVD burner , you can stick in a GeForce 7800GTX , and most likely you can use non-ECC RAM ( check motherboard requirements first though ) .So if you 're an avid gamer and need a good media machine , something from Alienware should do just fine . Personally I would choose a no-frills basic model like Dell 's XPS400 or E510 , get memory from Crucial.com ( or a good local store ) , and buy the video card from NewEgg.com . I 'm not familiar with molecular modeling programs but I would ask around if they are multi-processor enabled applications ( which means can more than one processor be recognized by the program ) . If so , you may want to get a dual-core processor as the modeling program can take advantage of the extra core and help with the number crunching . If not , then choosing a regular single-core CPU would suit you fine and save some cash ( it would be money wasted as games do n't effectively use a second core ) . For RAM , ask around about your modeling program because it would be primarily your task . For games , you 'll want at least 1GB of RAM . For video cards , I would chose whatever your budget allows you . The Nvidia 6600/6800/7800 lines are really good right now and I would n't suggest any ATIs at the moment except for the top-of-the-line X850/X1800 .",0

"principle of subsidiarity whay does mean ? SubsidiaritySubsidiarity is the idea that matters should be handled by the lowest competent authority . The Oxford English Dictionary defines subsidiarity as the idea that a central authority should have a subsidiary function , performing only those tasks which can not be performed effectively at a more immediate or local level . The concept is applicable in the fields of government , political science , cybernetics , and the management of large organizations . Subsidiarity is , ideally or in principle , one of the features of federalism . The word subsidiarity is derived from the Latin word subsidiarius and has its origins in Catholic social teaching . It is found in several constitutions around the world ( see for example the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ) . It is presently best known as a fundamental principle of European Union law . According to this principle , the EU may only act ( i.e . make laws ) where member states agree that action of individual countries is insufficient . The principle was established in the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht , and is contained within the proposed new Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe . Catholic social teaching The principle of subsidiarity holds that government should undertake only those initiatives which exceed the capacity of individuals or private groups acting independently . The principle is based upon the autonomy and dignity of the human individual , and holds that all other forms of society , from the family to the state and the international order , should be in the service of the human person . Subsidiarity assumes that these human persons are by their nature social beings , and emphasizes the importance of small and intermediate-sized communities or institutions , like the family , the church , and voluntary associations , as mediating structures which empower individual action and link the individual to society as a whole . `` Positive subsidiarity '' , which is the ethical imperative for communal , institutional or governmental action to create the social conditions necessary to the full development of the individual , such as the right to work , decent housing , health care , etc. , is another important aspect of the subsidiarity principle . The principle of subsidiarity was developed in the encyclical Rerum Novarum of 1891 by Pope Leo XIII , as an attempt to articulate a middle course between the perceived excesses of laissez-faire capitalism on the one hand and the various forms of totalitarianism , which subordinate the individual to the state , on the other . The principle was further developed in Pope Pius XI 's encyclical Quadragesimo Anno of 1931 , and Economic Justice for All by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops . Quadragesimo Anno In the encyclical Quadragesimo Anno , Pope Pius specifically said at paragraphs 79 and 80 : 79 . As history abundantly proves , it is true that on account of changed conditions many things which were done by small associations in former times can not be done now save by large associations . Still , that most weighty principle , which can not be set aside or changed , remains fixed and unshaken in social philosophy : Just as it is gravely wrong to take from individuals what they can accomplish by their own initiative and industry and give it to the community , so also it is an injustice and at the same time a grave evil and disturbance of right order to assign to a greater and higher association what lesser and subordinate organizations can do . For every social activity ought of its very nature to furnish help to the members of the body social , and never destroy and absorb them.80 . The supreme authority of the State ought , therefore , to let subordinate groups handle matters and concerns of lesser importance , which would otherwise dissipate its efforts greatly . Thereby the State will more freely , powerfully , and effectively do all those things that belong to it alone because it alone can do them : directing , watching , urging , rest",0

"My son has a math problem that I need to show him an alternate method of answering . Algebra formula please. ? `` The Monsters of Muzz '' opened on Monday . The first day there were 25 people who saw the movie . Word got out and on the second day 17 more people came than on the first day , so that 67 people had seen the movie after the second day . On the third day 59 people came , 17 more than on the second day . If each day 17 more people saw the movie than the day before , on what day would 500 people have seen the movie ? He solved it by adding adding , I want to give him a better way . The sum of the first N numbers is known to be : 1 + 2 + ... + N = N ( N+1 ) /2 ( Gauss formula ) If we write the values for N = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... we obtain the sequence:1 , 3 , 6 , 10 , 15 , 21 , 28 , 36 , 45 , 55 , ... Multiplying by 17 each term of the sequence we get:17 , 51 , 102 , 170 , 255 , 357 , 476 ... . we can stop.Let 's call s ( 1 ) , s ( 2 ) , s ( 3 ) , s ( 4 ) , s ( 5 ) , s ( 6 ) , s ( 7 ) the numbers aboveEach day 25 more people add to the first 25 , plus 17 more than the first day.On the n+1-th day you have 25 + 25*n + s ( n ) people.Let 's write the sequence of the 25*n:25 , 50 , 75 , 100 , 125 , 150 , 175 ... It 's easy to see that you can not reach 500 people until the seventh day ( n=6 so that s ( n ) = 357 big enough to reach 500 adding to the first 25 and to 150 ) I do n't think it was to solve by algebra , save for the use of the Gauss formula above .",0

"Why is alcohol legal ? In the UK the number of alcohol related deaths soars past 20 , 000 per year , and in the USA , the figure is more than double that . It was once illegal in the US , during a period known as prohibition . However , while alcohol use dipped initially , prohibition 's negative effects outweighed the positive ones . One problem is that despite the fact that alcohol was illegal , it was easy to make and import alcohol from outside the US . As well , prohibition did a great deal to contribute to organized crime , which profited of sales of alcohol . Since alcohol consumption was and is still well established in American and British culture , the demand is such that underground organizations would thrive . As such , we would see an increase in crime and probably not a tremendous fall in alcohol-related crime.To add to that , the alcohol-making industry has much more resources than the prohibitionist movement and thus prohibition is also less politically viable for financial reasons.For more info on prohibition , check out the Wikipedia article below .",0

"who is the presedent of canada ? No one . We do not have Presidents ( thank God ) . The official head of state of Canada is the Governor General ( Her Excellency the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean ) , who represents our Queen , Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.The Governor General takes the advice of the Prime Minister who is currently Stephen Harper.To echo a comment that someone made , we do have a very good system of government here . It is based on the Parliament system style of government used in the United Kingdom.The previous government lost a `` vote of confidence '' , and when this happens we normally hold an election . This only happened because we had a minority Liberal government . When the Gomery Report came out , the opposition parties ganged up and voted against the minority government.If you have a majority government , you 're stuck with the government until at most 5 years . But we usually have elections every 4 years.One thing we normally have more open politics here because of the parliamentary style of government . The leader of the opposition maintains a fairly good check on the actions of the ruling government . Our news is mainly revolving around the government and the goings on with politics and not sensational shootings and murder , so we also keep a sharp eye on our politicians.If you 're interested in learning more about my country and our style of government , please visit http : //www.canada.gc.ca/",0

At that time the Christian faith was managed like an organzied crime ring more powerful and pervaisive than the C Cosa Nostra , but remember , in China in 500 B C all the Confucian Scholars the emperor could arrest were behaeded and their works burned .

Check out the competition -- their business practices , pricing , customer service , etc . And also think about what you could offer to set yourself apart from these other companies.Check the sources for some handy sites.Prior to investing your time , money & effort into a business name , it is strongly advised that comprehensive research be conducted to ensure that the name you 're interested in is truly available .

"This guy likes me but I only like him as a friend . A compatibility test showed us together . What should I do ? & I already have a boyfrined in a long distance relationship who really likes me & vice-versa Oh well , a compatability test . Well , you should definately date him then ... no wait , that does n't make sense.Look , you are in a relationship . You have to deal with that first , long distance or not ... you have to respect yourself enough to honor that . If you want to stay committed there can be no question of dating other people . That should end the questions right there . If you are n't sure about the long distance relationship , end it or stipulate that you are going to see other people . Once you are there you can make a decision . Going on a date with your friend to see what happens does not commit you to him forever , but it can be cruel and encourage him . It could also endyour friendship ( wow , I just broke the guy-code and encouraged you to use the `` I like you , but as a friend line '' . I 'll probably burn in guy-hell ( which is probably a lot like ballet performed by drag queens ) If you do n't feel like you are romantically interested in him you should tell him .

"What is the metal from which penny coins are made of ? Following is a brief chronology of the metal composition of the cent coin ( penny ) : * The composition was pure copper from 1793 to 1837 . * From 1837 to 1857 , the cent was made of bronze ( 95 percent copper , and five percent tin and zinc ) . * From 1857 , the cent was 88 percent copper and 12 percent nickel , giving the coin a whitish appearance . * The cent was again bronze ( 95 percent copper , and five percent tin and zinc ) from 1864 to 1962 . ( Note : In 1943 , the coin 's composition was changed to zinc-coated steel . This change was only for the year 1943 and was due to the critical use of copper for the war effort . However , a limited number of copper pennies were minted that year . You can read more about the rare , collectible 1943 copper penny in `` What 's So Special about the 1943 Copper Penny . '' ) * In 1962 , the cent 's tin content , which was quite small , was removed . That made the metal composition of the cent 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc . * The alloy remained 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc until 1982 , when the composition was changed to 97.5 percent zinc and 2.5 percent copper ( copper-plated zinc ) . Cents of both compositions appeared in that year .",0

When is the new spouse held responsible for any debts ? Any info you have would be appreciated . Thanks . There are some general legal principles:1 . Spouses are generally presumed to co-own anything gained during the marriage and be responsible for any debts incurred during the marriage.2 . But there are a whole lot of exceptions.3 . And there is no way to know how these rules would be applied in each case . It 's all exceptionally fact-specific.4 . The only way to get a handle on the issues is to consult with a lawyer.5 .

"How do I help somebody stop their addiction to porn & masturbating ? Ok this is weird i know , but my friend asked me to help him stop . How do I help him ? And please do n't say something stupid !

What I mean is realize he is acting on very normal impulses , but seeking relief in unhealthy ways . If you make him feel guilty about it , it 'll only compound the problem.2 . Get him to agree to be held accountable for his actions . If you are his wife/partner , encourage him to talk to you or someone else he trusts whenever he feels he can not resist the temptation.3 . Get him to seek spiritual help . I am a born again believer in the Lord Jesus Christ . It 's only by His strength I can and will overcome this addiction ! 4 . Encourage him to take it a day at a time ( a minute at a time if necessary ) .5 . If he stumbles , encourage him to confess it , ask forgiveness from God , and get back on the wagon ( knowing he 's been forgiven ) .6 . NEVER give up on him ! And do your best not to allow him to give up on himself.There may come a point where there 's nothing more that you can do for this man ( save pray for him ) . If that time comes , do n't be afraid to leave him in God 's capable , loving hands . You ca n't heal him , but God is eager and well able to do just that ! I , on my part will endeavor to pray for you and your friend as I 'm reminded to do so . If I can help you further , drop me an email .",0

What ’ s far more important is whether you ’ re skilled at using your penis to satisfy your woman . Can you last as long as you want ? Can you vary the depth of your strokes , the pace of them , the angle of them , so that you can offer your woman a little teasing and unpredictability at times ? Are you skilled enough at other ways to pleasure her , so that penis-vagina intercourse is only one of the things on the menu you offer her ? Even if you can ’ t do all of these things at present , these are all things you can LEARN to do .

"What is a blue moon ? When did it happened ? The original definition is that a blue moon is the 3rd full moon in a season with 4 full moons . Sky and Telescope Magazine appears to be responsible for the modern definition ( 2nd full moon in a calendar month ) due to a mistake in an article in their magazine dating back to 1946 . They misinterpreted an earlier 1937 Maine Farmer 's Almanac article.Back when keeping time according to the moon was important for the Christian liturgical calendar , a 13th full moon in a year created a problem .",0

"Are Space and Time continuous or are them quantized ? There are two major theories of modern physics : Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity . Both work well , with QM being applicable to atomic and smaller sizes , and GR to large ( Solar size , galaxy size , etc . ) things.The major question in physics today is : how do we combine QM and GR so that they are two aspects of one larger theory . This postulated theory is usually called a Unified Theory or Theory of Everything or something like that . String theories are attempts to do this ( so far all are still incomplete ) .The major difference between QM and GR is that nn QM energy comes in discrete levels ( all way to small for us to notice ) . However in GR space-time is continious . So it is not instantly clear whether space-time is continous or quantized in a unified theory.For consistency between these space quantization would have to be on extremely small scales . This would almost certain occur ( if it did ) at distances called the Planck length , which is ~ 10^-33 cm . ( This is about one billion trillion times smaller than an atomic nucleus . ) Quantization of time would then be the interval for light to cross this distance , about 10^-43 seconds . It is because of a lack of a unified theory that physicists ca n't say anything about the conditions of the universe before 10^-43 seconds after the Big Bang . ( Of course that is still pretty good . ) The short answer is : no one knows , but the scale of quantization would have to be much , much smaller than any known elementary particle .",0
"I began dating someone who was recently diagnosed bi-polar . He 's lied & cheated , do i support him or move on ? I have an aunt that has been diagnosed for years .

They can also slip into a deep depression where they ca n't find an reason to get out of bed , or complete the simplest task to take care of themselves . Suicide is in greater numbers among this psychological diagnoses .

"how do i love Krishna ? If Krishna is a neighbor , then that 's fine . But if it is to love and serve as God , to find truth , or to worship then you are in trouble my friend . If you want to go to a destination , say Key West , you must first move toward that direction , and take the only road that leads you there , for all others roads will not get you there . And so it is with truth for God is not relative , for neither is truth . Any Religion will not take you to God . Religion is mans way to God , Christianity is Gods way to man . Jesus Christ said `` I am the truth , the light , the way and that no one comes to the Father but through him '' Some may call that narrow minded , but no one ever claimed to be who he was , then proved what he claimed to be . We all shall stand before God and give account of our lives , what we did with what God blessed us with , and the most important question is what we did with the truth of his word by receiving Jesus Christ , his son as the supreme love of our life . The odds of dying are still 1:1 . We all shall receive eternal life , many in heaven who accepted Christ , and others in hell whom rejected him . Jesus Christ is the only way to Heaven .

"If a sphere , a disc & a ring of same radius are made to roll over an INCLINED plane , in what order will ... .. they reach downwards & Why ? This question sounds like your teacher/ta/whoever wants you to make 3 assumptions ( or they already did and you just didnt mention it ) : They have the same mass ( otherwise he would have to specify the masses of each ) Air resistance is negligible ( pretty common ) They all roll without slipping ( otherwise they all get to the bottom together ) If you make these assumptions , the order is based on their respective moments of inertia about the center . They each move downward at a speed based on their rotation , so the order they reach the bottom will be smallest rotational inertia first . Sphere , disk , ring .",0

"How can i find the molar volume ? The molar volume is the volume occupied by one mole of ideal gas at STP . Its value is:22.414 L mol¯1It is actually known to several more decimal places but the number above should prove sufficient.This value has been known for about 200 years and it is not a constant of nature like , say , the charge on the electron . If we had picked a diffeent standard temperature , then the molar volume would be different.Using PV = nRT , you can calculate the value for molar volume . V is the unknown and n = 1.00 mol .

"Why do my feet smell so bad ? The main reason some people 's feet ( or more precisely , some people 's socks and shoes ) smell worse than other people 's is that some people sweat more than other people . This is just one of the many variable physiological qualities of human beings . This is also why sometimes your feet smell much worse than at other times -- it all has to do with how much you sweat.So , since foot odor is caused by bacteria digesting sweat , there are two main ways to reduce the stink . You can : * decrease the amount of bacteria on your feet * decrease the amount of sweat that collects on your feet and in your shoes Reducing the level of bacteria is really a matter of cleanliness . To control the bacteria population on you feet , you should : * wash your feet with strong anti-bacterial soap * wear clean socks * do n't wear the same shoes everyday - give a pair of shoes 24 hours or more to air out before wearing them again To reduce the amount of sweat that collects in your shoes , you should : * wear well-ventilated shoes instead of very constrictive shoes , such as boots * always wear socks , preferably made of cotton or other absorbent materials that absorb a lot of the sweat so the bacteria ca n't feed on it * change your socks a few times a day * buy some absorbent Odor-Eater type shoe inserts * apply an antiperspirant to your feet If your foot odor is really bad and these solutions do n't help much , then you should see a doctor . There are a number of prescription drugs that can treat serious foot odor , some by killing bacteria and some by reducing foot sweat .",0

"how can a helicopter hover while the earth is turning ? The first answer is correct . I think for the second answer , the questioner would probably be wondering ... well , if the helicopter takes off with the same velocity as the earth , since the heli is now hovering and the earth keeps on turning , why does n't the earth spin past the helicopter ... And that is simply because the atmosphere is turning around with the heli , like the first answer stated.Just wanted to elaborate with another example . A fly takes off from the dashboard of a speeding car with its windows closed . Does the fly stay in air or , since the fly is now seperated from the car , does the car rush forward , making it seem like the fly is hurtled to the back of the car ? Even in this case , the air inside the car is being brought along with the car at the same speed . Therefore , the speed of the fly relative to the car will always be 0 .",0

"How is `` Evolution '' plausible or logical ? Simply because Darwin used well developed ( by humans , but well developed nonetheless ) , well proven , scientific methodolgy instead of relying on the dogmas of a belief system to base his observations on.Keep in mind that , in science , there are very few laws any longer . Everything is a theory because , especially after relativity , scientists discovered that our universe does n't stay consistent as you move into and out of certain states ( like the speed of light ) . However , this does not eliminate the theory as quackery or false . It means that the theory can only be applied in certain circumstances ( it 's relative to certain states ) so it can not be a `` law '' as laws are immutable.That being said , science only has observable evidence as it 's foundation ( or provable evidence through mathematics ) . Darwin observed the various species on the Galapagos islands and drew conclusions as to the nature of their adaptations ( long beaks , short beaks , etc. ) . He also observed that various birds with nearly identical characteristics had slight variations in their adaptations . This caused him to draw other conclusions . In short , he used a scientific process to develop early versions of his theory of evolution . It has been scrutinized since , and the only ones `` disproving '' it have been those who belive religious texts are God 's absolute word.I am a believer in Christ , yet I see no issue with believing there is truth to Darwin 's theories . Did God ultimately create all things ? Of course He did . However , is the Bible absolute in it 's description in the origins of life ? Probably not . Even Christ , according to the biblical record , spoke in stories ( parables ) most of the time so people would understand his message and have examples to work from . He rarely spoke in absolutes , and when he did it was usually only with the apostles.I belive that Genesis is a parable describing God 's creation of all that is , in an understandable way since it is unlikely that we will ever completely understand how He did it . However , even I admit it is only a belief , and may be wrong , like Darwin may be wrong , or literal interpretations of Genesis may be wrong .",0

I have a degree in biology and I could n't give you a solid answer . It will be a word that you should have been studying in class.Ie. , Adaptation - mutations that give an organism an advantageMutation - alterations in genetic makeupEvolution - changes in organisms over time due to adaptationNatural Selection - conditions which select adaptationsI would go with adaptation , but no guarantees . The concept here is that as we take antibiotics we kill a lot of bacteria , but not all of them . The remaining few that survive are the `` tougher '' ones , at least ones that are n't affected as much by the antibiotics . These remaining bacteria may continue to grow in numbers . If they ever succeed in infecting more people , the antibiotics will now do nothing.P.S ... A lot of people think that bacteria randomly mutate until one of them becomes resistant . This is only part of the story . Antibiotics almost always originate from other bacteria , or some other organism trying to fend off bacteria . These antibiotics are not new , just new to medicine . Bacteria have been resisting these antibiotics for millions of years . Maybe not actively , but somewhere in their past it has probably been encountered .

"Why do muslims and the rest of the world do n't get along ? We can just look over everything and get to know wat we really are as humans ; we can share and enjoy common interests as humans other than wars ! ! ! Perhaps your question arises out of the current situation . The muslims can tolerate every thing , but making jokes about relegion is a no no . As they them selves never joke about the prophets of other relegions . Among them selves they make really sadistic and some times down right dirty jokes about their current relegious scholars , leaders , but never about any prophet . Be it Moses , Jesus , David , Abraham , Solomon or Mohammad . Any muslim who makes a joke or insults any relegious book or prophet or God , automatically becomes a non muslim.To respect and pledge faith about all prophets is a must in Islam . If any one makes a joke about the prophet of Islam , of course the muslims will react . Other than that I have had the chance to work with Hindus , Sikhs , ( in fact we used to live in the same house ) , Buddhists , Christians , and many others , I do n't remember a single incident when we did not get along . In fact we were and still are good friends .",0

"what is a good diet to follow for losing weight ? Do not skip meals . Have a fat-free diet with lots of fibre in it.Avoid fried and oily stuff , red meat , eggs , sugar , alcohol , coke , milk , butter etc . Walk at a brisk pace for minimum 45 minutes daily . Salads , soups , fruits low in sweetness are good . Have brown bread , skimmed milk . Lots of water and liquid diet also help . Keep a record of what you eat , how long you walk or excercise , and your weight on a daily basis.Cabbage soup is supposed to be a good fat burner . This alongwith veg salads and fruits for one week with walking daily twice for 30 minutes can bring down weight by 3 pounds . Do not do this continuously beyond a week at a time . You can do so every alternate week . Have a b-complex tablet every alternate day.If you have any side effects , see a doctor.Wish you all the very best .",0

The most powerful Islamic schools are there and people believe in Islamic leaders . Even when they were called for vote they got permission for it from their religious leader . They have been guards of many holy shrines there even before crusade wars . you ca n't tell them how to think about freedom , it seems they find clergy government more free than democracy and they are fighting for freedom.This is very important for US because of Domino theory which US hope to happen in middle east and all other countries there see what a beauty is Democracy in Iraq and try to have one but it will not happen , I think the second US leave the Iraq they will overthrow their government and make a new Islamic-Clergy type .",0

"why is the sky blue ? Space is black and the sun is like yellowish-orangish , so why blue , or sometimes gray The sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering . This effect was actually first observed and described by John Tyndall , and a only few years later was explored in more detail by Lord Rayleigh.Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of light by particles . In the case of the sky , these particles are the molecules of air , themselves , and not dust or water vapor as is often proferred . The scattering depends on the wavelength of the light . Light towards the violet end of the spectrum scatters more than light at the red end . Sunlight is scattered throughout the sky and causes it to appear blue to an observer on the ground . The reason the sky does n't appear violet to us has to do with the sensetivity of the cones in the human eye.Just as the blue light gets scattered , red light from the sun travels farther , which is why the sun appears yellowish-orangish . In space the sun appears noticeably more blue . Space is black because there are almost no particles to scatter light .",0

"What is a post-masters graduate certificate ? I have found a school that offers a post-masters graduate certificate . They say it is almost as good as a PHD . Any suggestions The post-masters graduate certificate is a degree level that is intermediate between the masters degree and the doctorate . It became popular in education careers where promotions or job grades depended in part on educational level . They recognized this `` sixth year '' degree level as one year of study beyond the master 's degree . You also sometimes see it referred to as a `` specialist 's '' degree because some of the early post-masters degrees were Educational Specialist ( Ed.S . ) degrees . Other common names are Certificate of Advanced Study or Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study . The utility of the post-masters certificate depends on what field you are in and why you want the degree . Some fields of study have the specialist level as the entering level for certification or licensure ( school psychology , for example ) , in which case you would find it vital . Some fields ( counseling , for example ) might have the level of training required for licensure at the equivalent of the post-masters certificate level ( 60 semester hours ) in which case having the certificate would be an advantage if you want to get licensed . Some fields allow you to specialize after taking a post masters certificate ( i.e . Infant Mental Health Nursing ) in which case the certificate is very useful . On the other hand , some fields really require a doctorate ( most college teaching , for example ) in which case the post-masters certificate , while good to have , wo n't fulfil the occupational requirement.I think the post-masters certificate is nice if you are working toward continuing education as it can help you make a more systematic study in your area of interest , and it appears that you have met a more unified goal than just taking courses.Hope this helps .",0

It is not necessarily a position where the person says affirmatively that God does not exist . Atheist is a general statement about a non belief in any God concept.Hard Atheist : This is the person who says that God does not exist , affirmatively.Weak Atheist : This is a person who does not feel that there is any quality evidence for the existence of God . They do not rule the concept of God out definitely , but they see no reason to believe in any of the Gods they know of.Agnostic : Agnosticism is not a position on whether one believes in God or not , it is a position on whether one believes that it is possible to know positively whether God exists or not . Additionally it ’ s a position on whether God can be known through experience .",0
"Story from Reader 's Digest to be aired in TV-Movie tonight at 8 . Do you happen to know what channel to find it show timeNora Roberts Nora Roberts is truly a publishing phenomenon . With over 250 million copies of her novels in print , she has come a long way since she wrote her first novel in a spiral notebook using a No . 2 pencil . Now she has published over 150 novels and her work has been optioned and made into films , excerpted in national magazines and translated in over twenty-five different countries . `` I always have stories running around in my head , '' she explains . `` Once I start putting them down on paper , I just keep going ; I just keep writing . '' In addition to her amazing success in mainstream fiction , Nora Roberts remains committed to writing for her category romance audience that took her to into their heart in 1981 with her very first book , a Silhouette romance . Nora Roberts continues to write futuristic romantic suspense as J.D . Robb , and her characters Eve Dallas and Roarke have become two of her most popular creations ever . Her J.D . Robb titles are hailed as `` a perfect balance of suspense , futuristic police procedure and steamy romance ... truly fine entertainment '' by Publishers Weekly .

By the time her first novel , Irish Thoroughbred , was published in 1981 , she already had three years of hard work behind her and several rejected manuscripts languishing in drawers . Today , according to Entertainment Weekly , `` her stories have fueled the dreams of twenty-five million readers . '' One of America 's leading novelists , her books are published around the world . She is frequently invited to promote her novels in other countries . Her recent travels took her to England , Italy , Australia and Japan to meet fans , fellow authors and aspiring writers .

"What diet works the best to drop 20 lbs within 5 months ? This can easily be done .

"why is 13 considered unlucky ? Triskaidekaphobia is the fear of 13 , a number commonly associated with bad luck in Western culture . While fear of the number 13 can be traced back to medieval times , the word triskaidekaphobia itself is of recent vintage , having been first coined by Coriat ( 1911 ; Simpson and Weiner 1992 ) . It seems to have first appeared in the general media in a Nov. 8 , 1953 New York Times article covering discussions of a United Nations committee . This superstition leads some people to fear or avoid anything involving the number 13 . In particular , this leads to interesting practices such as the numbering of floors as 1 , 2 , ... , 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 , ... ( Sloane 's A011760 ; the `` elevator sequence '' ) , omitting the number 13 , in many high-rise American hotels , the numbering of streets avoiding 13th Avenue , and so on . Apparently , 13 has n't always been considered unlucky . In fact , it appears that in ancient times , 13 was either considered in a positive light or ( more commonly ) not at all ( Adams ) . The association of bad luck with the number 13 has been attributed to the fact there were 13 people at the Last Supper of Jesus , although this association seems to have originated only in medieval times . The association has also been linked to that fact that lunisolar calendars ( such as the Hebrew and Chinese calendars ) must have 13 months in some years in order to synchronize the solar and lunar cycles , while the solar Gregorian calendar in universal current usage always has 12 months in a year . Triskaidekaphobia also may be related to Norse mythology , which tells how the god Odin invited eleven of his closest friends to a dinner party at his home in Valhalla , only to have his party crashed by Loki , the god of evil and turmoil , thus giving a total of 13 people . The legend goes on to related how Balder , one of the most beloved gods , tired to throw Loki out of the party , resulting in a scuffle and ultimately Balder 's death with a mistletoe-tipped arrow . Fear of the number 13 also leads to fear of Friday the thirteenth ( a fear recently dubbed paraskevidekatriaphobia ) , despite the fact that Friday turns out to be the most common weekday on which the 13th of a month can occur in the Gregorian calendar . The association of bad luck with Friday appeared in Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales in the late 14th century ( `` and on a Friday fell all this misfortune '' ) , but references to Friday as a day associated with ill luck in general first appear around the middle of the 17th century ( Mikkelson and Mikkelson ) . In particular , it appeared in numerous publications as a particularly unlucky day to start a new venture ( beginning a journey , giving birth , getting married , moving , starting a new job , etc . ) beginning around 1800 ( Mikkelson and Mikkelson ) . While 13 is associated with the number of people at the Last Supper , the Crucifixion took place on a Friday , thus leading to an association of back luck with the combination of this number and day . Note that the association of Friday the thirteenth with the arrest of Jacques de Molay , Grand Master of the Knights Templar , on Friday , October 13 , 1307 by King Philip IV of France is a modern-day invention ( Mikkelson and Mikkelson ) . Paraskevidekatriaphobia is probably the most widespread superstition in the United States , possibly affecting tens of millions of Americans . Interestingly , a study by Scanlon et al . ( 1993 ) published in the prestigious British Medical Journal which analyzed the relation between health , behavior , and superstition surrounding Friday 13th in the United Kingdom by comparing the ratio of traffic volume to traffic accidents on Friday the 6th and Friday the 13th over a period of years found that , `` The risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52 % . Staying at home is recommended . '' While there does not appear to be hard evidence to support the claim , it has been suggested that $ 800 to $ 900 millio",0

"do u know about natual disaster concepts ? tsunami , cyclones , earth quakes A natural disaster is a catastrophe that occurs when a hazardous physical event ( such as a volcanic eruption , earthquake , landslide , hurricane , or any of the other natural phenomena listed below ) precipitates extensive damage to property , a large number of casualties , or both . In areas where there are no human interests , natural phenomena do not result in natural disasters.A cyclone is the rotation of a volume of air about an area of low atmospheric pressure . Cyclones are responsible for a wide variety of different meteorological phenomena such as tropical cyclones and tornadoes . Because of this , most weather forecasters avoid using the term cyclone without a qualifying term.An earthquake is a sudden and sometimes catastrophic movement of a part of the Earth 's surface . Earthquakes result from the dynamic release of elastic strain energy that radiates seismic waves . Earthquakes typically result from the movement of faults , planar zones of deformation within the Earth 's upper crust . Most earthquakes are tectonic , but they also occur in volcanic regions and as the result of a number of anthropogenic sources , such as reservoir induced seismicity , mining and the removal or injection of fluids into the crust.A tsunami is a series of waves generated when water in a lake or the sea is rapidly displaced on a massive scale . Earthquakes , landslides , volcanic eruptions and large meteorite impacts all have the potential to generate a tsunami . The effects of a tsunami can range from unnoticeable to devastating .",0

"What features did a medieval castle have ? Stone , mortar , wood-these were the simple components used to construct some of the most heavily fortified structures ever created.Early castles relied on the surrounding landscape to provide much of the protection . Early castles were made of wood and built on hills of `` mottes '' . Surrounded by a high , wooden palisade , motte and bailey castles were used widely until the Norman invasion of 1066 . These fortifications proved too easy to burn , and stone was then used more frequently.Castles were rarely the most comfortable place to live , with only the lord and his family given adequate heat and other amenities . Medieval castles were built for safety , not comfort . Windows were little more than slits in the wall . Cold , stone floors and walls rarely kept in heat , and water had to be brought by the bucketful throughout the castle . Walls were built high to protect from advancing armies , and to provide needed lookout positions.For detailed information , visit : http : //www.medieval-castles.net/castle_architecture/index.htmThe simple stone and mortar architecture made repairs fairly easy to make . It was not uncommon for stones to be used over and over with each successive castle built on the same location . Cannons and gunpowder made the castle ineffective and these large structures evolved in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance to become manor homes and palaces .",0

"I am 21 so why do n't i have regular periods ? Hormonal imbalances . Usually caused by diet . If you are too thin , you may not have enough body fat - it 's actually the cholesterol in your body ( fat ) that is used to make estrogen . Fatter women tend to look `` softer '' or more feminine.Estrogen is used to make the lining of your uterus that you shed every month.But progesterone is used to coagulate the lining so it sheds at a regular time period . It 's released after the egg is released , so it gets higher just before your period . Certain foods can interfere with the balance of estrogen and progesterone . Soy foods are particularly high in estrogen and can throw things off balance . Progesterone is also released from the adrenal glands , which also release cortisol - a stress hormone . Too much stress makes the adrenals concentrate on releasing cortisol and not on progesterone . Again , things get out of balance.Try to eliminate soy products ( and they are everywhere - most `` vegetable oils '' are soy oil ) and see if that helps . Do some deep breathing and meditation to relax and reduce the cortisol levels .",0

You 're looking for two numbers that fill in the blanks below : __ x __ = -240__ + __ = 8Prime facorization will help give you some ideas , or make an ordered list of numbers that multiply to -240 . 240 and -1120 and -280 and -360 and -448 and -540 and -630 and -824 and -1020 and -12See how the last pair of numbers satisfies the conditions ? Rewrite your polynomial , substituting the 2 values in for B to have 4 terms:16x^2 + 20x - 12x -15Then factor by grouping ( 16x^2 - 12x ) + ( 20x - 15 ) 4x ( 4x - 3 ) + 5 ( 4x - 3 ) ( 4x + 5 ) ( 4x - 3 ) This method works for most polynomials of the form Ax^2 + By + C ! You can check your answer of ( 4x + 5 ) ( 4x - 3 ) by using the FOIL method and see that it does work.Good luck !",0

"Heavy water what is the role that heavy water plays in the nuclear explosion process ? Heavy water is like regular water except that instead of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom ( H20 ) it has two deuterium atoms and an oxygen atom ( D20 ) . Deuterium is a hydrogen atom with an extra neutron.Water is used in nuclear reactors to moderate the reaction speed , and to absorb heat . Nuclear fission starts by giving off neutrons that create a chain reaction . Any water around it absorbs those neutrons ( becoming heavy water ) and slows the reaction . If heavy water is used instead of regular hydrogen water , the neutrons are not absorbed . This means that less pure nuclear material can be used to sustain a reaction . For example unrefined uranium , which is much less expensive , can be used instead of enriched uranium .",0

"What is the easiest way to get a college degree on the net ? Is n't an easy way to do it , in fact , for some people it is more difficult to get an online degree than a traditional classroom based degree . You need a lot of self-discipline , high reading ability , and motivation to do a lot of learning on your own to do an online program . The only part of an online program that people view as `` easier '' is that you are n't necessarily tied down to a particular time of day to do your work . So , if you are a night owl you can do all your work at night , for example.That said , if you are interested in an online degree then you should seek a degree from a school that also has an established classroom based degree program . Recognize that many people still have a stigma toward internet degrees , so having a degree from an established college/university will lessen the stigma . Hope this helps .",0

You can see this in real life : A candle flame is yellow , but a blowtorch , which is much hotter , is blue.Color also gives astronomers an indication of how old the star is : Stars cool down as they age , so a red star would be very old and on its way to dyinng ( Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star , on its way out ) , while white and blue stars are more recently formed",0

"The weather just said we will have snow showers , but the current temp is 36 . Can snow form above freezing ? Your temprature of 36 degrees is simply a ground level temprature . It is not the air temprature of the weather system that you are currently within . Because of that , the air temprature above you , where the snoe will form is quite a bit colder . Once snow starts to form within the weather system , the ground temprature will begin to drop from 36 Degrees to around 30-28 degrees for a short period of time . From 22-28 degrees snow falls best .

"An ounce of high grade pot can have a street value higher than an ounce of gold . Why not legalize and tax ? It is less harmful than liquor and tobbacco . I could not possibly agree more with you . People are so reluctant to legalize marijuana because it has such a bad reputation . Of course , it gets that reputation because it is illegal and people pass judgment on it based solely on that fact . If you stop looking at the actual legality of it and just think about it morally it is a vice no worse than many others that americans find perfectly acceptable . Anything can be abused . People abuse alcohol , cigarettes , fast food , gambling and countless things which are perfectly legal and socially acceptable , but somehow so many people think smoking weed is just wrong.I can hardly see how continuing to make it illegal will benefit anyone . It only allows drug dealers to set the standards of production/regulation etc . all the while evading taxes . Making it illegal probably does not really curtail the use of the drug either . Did prohibition curtail the use of alcohol ? nope . did it increase crime ? yes.Legalize it and regulate it . Everyone wins . The potheads wo n't have to worry about getting locked up . The government can make some more cash . And we wo n't continue to whaste our time prosecuting potheads and enforcing rediculous laws that combat marijuana use at the expense of taxpayer 's dollars.aside from these reasons , weed just is n't that bad . It is not physically addictive ( as is alcohol/tobacco ) , it does not have the reputation of making people violent/abusive ( as does alcohol ) , it is not as closely associated with recklessness ( as is alcohol ) and when was the last time you threw up or had a hangover from smoking some weed ? never.Legalize it ! !",0

"why should aperson lose their job for forgeetting to turn in money that they are told to keep in their pockets My daughter was a very dedicated employee at Dayton International airport , went to work on her off days just to help out , did whatever her job duties call for her to do , a very repectful young lady that spent six year in the US Army . Nine months in Iraq . She was fired from the airport because they are told to keep money that they collect from customer in their pocket until the end of the day , instead of having a cash box for them to put the money in as soon as they collect it . She forgot she had the money in her pocket three times and took the money home ; therefore they fired her . Although she took the money back each time . She had been working there for one year and that is all they could find to fire her for . She really need her job she have a 4 year old daughter that she is raising . She have bills each month . it 's a shame when young people choose to get out and work and not be on public assistant to get fired for something like that . it 's hard to find jobs . I think it 's sad that your daughter lost her job at the aiport , she sounded like a very dedicated employee willing to go the extra mile even on her days off . But it is probably best she is no longer there because what you are describing here is that she was probably long past exhaustion each time she accidentally took the money home , although I am certain the airport did n't consider this when they decided to fire her.On the WHY part of your question : When she first was employeed by the airport she probably signed an agreement of `` if I mishandle money in any way that is n't in agreement with the airports rules , I understand that is grounds for dismissal '' If she agreed to these terms and broke them , is was their call to be understanding or not . They were 2 times before , but when they see a pattern of it , they are less likely to trust their money is safe . They will protect themsevles before protecting her.I agree they should n't make it so easy to leave your shift without turning the money in first . Just like with waiters and waitresses , or bartenders that most of the time must carry change on them , if the airport had an end shift report to do before each employee was allowed to leave , then it could all be resolved . I do n't know any waiters or waitresses that can leave for the day without giving the company their money first , along with reporting their tipped earnings for the day.Her honesty in giving the money back is something to be proud of , and she should n't hold bad memories against the airport for their descision . She made a mistake , we all do that once in a while . She 'll find another job , and she will have this experience to learn from .",0

"whats the best way to fight a cold ? The best way to fight the common cold virusEvery year , as each winter season approaches us , it gets harder and harder for people to avoid getting a cold . It never fails , just as soon as the weather changes a little and starts to turn cold , people begin to sniffle , sneeze and cough and the symptoms of the common cold begin to come around once again.But before you run out to the nearest store to buy a supply of tissues , cold medicine and soup , you need to understand exactly what you are up against . Your chances of being exposed to a cold germ will increase or decrease depending on the amount of contact you have with other people and how you take care of yourself.The cold germ is spread from person to person when someone , who is infected , sneezes or coughs into the air or on you . The airborne germ then enters someone else ’ s body through an orifice , like your eyes , nose or mouth . You can also catch a cold by touching something that a person who has been infected has also touched and then touching your mouth , nose or eyes.There are many things that you can do to prevent yourself from getting a cold.1 . You should wash your hands a lot . This frequent hand washing , especially when using any anti-bacterial soap , will help you to get rid of any potential germs that you might have come into contact with.2 . You should carry and use anti-bacterial hand lotion several times throughout the day . Use it especially when you can not get to a bathroom and you know you have touched something infected or have been near an infected person.3 . You should also get plenty of sleep or rest . If you are tired and fatigued , your body ’ s resistance decreases and you will find that you are more susceptible to colds.There are many ways that you can fight a cold once you have caught one.1 . You should eat spicy foods . Spicy hot foods will cause your body to expel mucus . When you eat these types of foods , your nose will start to run and you will begin to cough up mucus . Spicy foods work just like a natural decongestant but without side effects . This advice is good for those people who can not take over the counter medication.2 . You should drink plenty of liquids . Liquids like soup , water , juice and flat ginger ale will keep your body hydrated . This is true especially if you have a fever . During a fever , your body loses a lot of fluids . You will need to replenish what you have lost . Therefore you need to drink often throughout your illness . You should also avoid drinking any dairy drinks because the dairy will cause mucus to form and coat your throat making it very difficult for you to swallow and cough.3 . You should use a vaporizer . It will keep the air that you breathe moist . If you do not have a vaporizer handy , then just crack open the windows in your home . This is very important if you have an extremely warm and dry home . Cracking the windows will have the same effects that a vaporizer has .",0

"Why do people every six minutes have to ask which came first the chicken or the egg ? The answer is always the egg . Thats the correct answer anyway . 1 ) Because they can ? : ^ ) 2 ) Because they like to stir up debates between creationists and evolutionists.3 ) Because they think it is an unanswerable riddle when it isn't.It is an interesting question but people really do n't think it through enough to show just how interesting it is . How you answer the question reflects on your belief system , your powers of deductive reasoning , and/or your sense of humor.If you subscribe to evolution ( as I do ) , then it 's very simple -- eggs existed long before chickens ever did . Fish lay eggs . Amphibians lay eggs . Reptiles lay eggs . Dinosaurs layed eggs . Prototypical birds layed eggs . Early mammals layed eggs . ( Even current mammals called monotremes lay eggs ) . So obviously eggs came before chickens by this line of reasoning.Following evolutionary theory , genetics , and the development of embryos , one might argue that again , the egg came before the chicken because the first chicken is a genetic mutation of two chicken like parents . So , from this line of reasoning , you might , again argue the egg if you are talking about first chicken relative to the egg . For the first chicken had to develop inside the egg as the offspring of two chicken-like parents.But then I realized `` Hey , how did the first zygotic chicken ( fertilized ovum ) get inside the egg in the first place ? '' If the ovum was inside an egg shell with yoke and rooster sperm is added afterward , then the egg comes first . But what if the the ovum is fertilized first , then encased in an egg shell ? Then would not the zygotic chicken come before the egg ? A quick look on Wikipedia for bird reproduction indicates that the eggs are fertilized with sperm during the descent from the ovaries through the cloaca . If this is the case , then , again , the egg comes before the chicken.So , I forgot to add one reason people ask this question every six minutes:4 ) Because they have too much time on their hands . : ^ )",0

The last I heard , they had approved a utility uniform that uses a pixelated pattern a la USMC MARPAT or ARMY ACU , but it is different in pattern and color . I believe the chest pockets are still vertical ( not slanted ) among other differences from the other guys . They did ditch the corny blue tiger stripe thing , though.http : //capblog.typepad.com/capblog/images/041008f5064j020.jpg",0
"what is the best trick to play on someone when in a school libary ? In a school library these days , most books have a little ID tag in them . If you try to take a book out without checking it out , this tag causes a little alarm to go off at the exit.Find one of these tags . Remove it from a book ( use one of the books that never gets checked out anyway ) , and secret it on your friend 's person.When they try to leave , the system will think that they have stolen a book . They will be searched . There 's no book . They 'll never find the little tag . It 's hysterical .",0

"Is Jesus Christ born on Christmas Day ? No one knows for sure when Jesus Christ was born , but many scholars believe it was probably around the first of October . Dec. 25 was formerly celebrated as the birthday of the pagan diety Mithras in the Roman Empire . The Emperor Constantine who legalized Christianity in the Empire in the 4th century A.D. , commandeered the holiday for the Christians in his empire . You need not feel guilty , however , if you celebrate the birth of Jesus on this day as this has been a tradition all over the world for centuries and the original pagan meaning of the day has been all but obliterated by time and tradition . Hope this helps. > < > Sir Brian",0

"I have a friend who I have been studying with and I think that she and I have a connection . Should I pursue it The two of us and another person have been studying all semester . Although I have felt a real connection , I am fearful of acting on it becaue I am afraid of ruining a friendship I really enjoy . We are both single parents , we have similar values and she is more beautiful than I can possibly describe . It seems that any excuse we can make to get together we do but i do not know if it is because we are both really stressed out , if it is a friendship thing or what.I am very confused and have been balancing between being transparent and being coy trying to gauge her reaction.Do I just wait and see what happens or do I take the bull by the horns and just tell her ? Go for it . Take the chance . Cause she might have the same feelings and you do n't know it . Maybe she is waiting for you to say something . So like I said go for it , Tell her that you felt a connection . You wo n't know till you try it . GOOD LUCK !",0

"Men do you perfer thick girls over skinney girls or skinney girls over thick girls ? Tell me with a little detail so I can really undserstand your reasons . Tell me the benefits of your preference . I myself prefer skinney girls over thick girls because I am skinny . Skinney girls also tend to be more fit unless they are too skinney . Thicker girls are usually fat . The things I like to do might not be able to be done by a thicker girl . To me skinner girls are hotter . You can check out their figure . However with thicker girls their figure is , um , sometimes lumpy and such ; not as pleasing to look at . Personality is also important when it comes to this subject unless you 're looking for a quick hook-up . It just so happens that the smartest girls that have really good personalitys are also the hottest-it 's the best of both worlds . Thicker girls could work-out to lose weight if they want . I like to go mountain biking so if a thicker girl found that out and asked to come of course I would want her to and then anything could happen after that . There are some people that prefer thicker girls . I hope this answer helps you understand .",0

"Why do so many Christians seem to think that they have a monopoly on happiness ? Oh , wrathpuppet , you poor sad atheist . You have no hope . You and you kind are so sad.I read this a lot . Can you not accept that myself and many non-believers are actually warm , loving , hopeful , happy people ? It seems profoundly arrogant to assume that because someone does n't share your beliefs that they must be miserable . I 'm stating as a fact that this is not the case.So , why assume that we are all sad and hopeless ? We have hope for a better world , believing that this is our one chance , and as such , our responsibility to future generations.You assumptions are much the same as a billionaire believing that a migrant farm worker can not be happy because he has no money . Or a farm worker believing that a wealthy man can not be happy because he is tethered to his work.It is very presumptuous to assume that just because someone has something ( or lacks something ) that they can not be happy.Anyone care to comment on this ? Whew -- Here 's a question to all those who post about religious folks and non-religious folks ... Are we ever going to settle this ? Yeah did n't think so.Still I commend Wrathpuppet and the more thoughtful responders by espousing their beliefs in as clear a manner as possible , and Schneb- That 's got to be one of your shorter replies , kudos on the mutual respect.I 'm going to shy away from a grandiose analogy , for a simpler one that might still fit.Ever went to see a movie the day it came out , was blown away by it , and when you told your friends they needed to see it , and right away , they blew you off ? Ya know like they 'd heard bad reviews , or just did n't think the material was something they were interested in . But it 's killing you because you love and respect these people and you wish them to share in this wonderful cinematic experience ... and you 're sure if they would just take the time and go , they 'd thank you for it later ? ** to carry this theme out ... it 's not that you believe these folks ( that you 're trying to tell about this great movie ) have never seen a good picture before or that they could n't discover it on their own , it 's just that it was SO good for you , SO moving , SO vital , that you really believed if they never saw it , their life would not be as rich as if they had.Shortest answer possible , they think they 're doing you a favor or a kindness , you may already have an interesting life that has happiness in it , but they fear for your eternal happiness . I for one will leave each to their own , and only try an help the ones who say they are unhappy or in some need , and the answer from me rarely will have religious overtones . My God is just love . Wrath , judgement , the need to be worshipped and obeyed are the attributes of other 's Gods . The afterlife does not hold auditions .",0
