"Is a war with China inevitable ? Please , be specific . I do n't think the US is going to ask for war against China . That 's just stupid . But I think it is very likely that China will force us into War against our will . The teetering balance with Taiwan is just the tip of the iceberg . China has it 's eyes on the entire region -- the entire world for that matter.I think we 're safe for at least a few more years ... maybe even as many as 10 . China has n't finished feeding off of the US yet . They 'll wait until they have more money , more military technology , and they will wait until their generation of all men grows to a good military fighting age . There is a space of more than 10 years where the boys outnumber the girls 13 to 1 . This generation will be more enthused about risking their lives to take over territory that actually has females . It must be understood that this is n't `` inevitable '' just because China has the manpower . It is thought that it will happen because China pretty much says that it is going to happen . China , though it just loves to cater to the US 's cheep labor force needs , is openly anti-American . The students learn about the US as an evil empire . So is it truly `` inevitable '' ? I think the relationship between the US and China could change -- I think we could possibly become friends . But it is much more likely that in the future China will show aggression to the US or the US 's interest that will lead us into war .",1

"Is it legal to publicly rate medical doctors ? In the US and other countries.e.g . could I create a web site where I say that I rate Doctor X 70/100 and Doctor Y 75/100 , without any other explanation ? What if I do provide an explanation ? What if I rated mechanics instead of medical doctors ? NOT LEGAL ADVICE : As long as you make it clear that you are offering your opinion , then your ratings will be protected by the US Constitution 's 1st Amendment protection for free speech . ( You are in the US , right ? ) If you falsely or misleadingly indicate that your rankings are based on something other than your opinion , then there may be liability for libel or even fraud . However , if the rankings are based on some criteria other than your opinion , and you are explicit about the basis for the rankings and truthful about the results , you are similarly protected . Should n't be a difference for medical or mechanical rankings . But , keep in mind that if people rely on your endorsement and then something goes wrong , they may seek to hold you liable . The best protection against this is to be explicit about your sources ( opinion , etc . ) and have a lawyer advise you.Good luck !",1
"Why was an embargo put on Cuba ? `` When , on January 7 , 1959 , Fidel Castro assumed control of Cuba after President Fulgencio Batista fled on December 31 , the U.S. government initially supported the Cuban Revolution , formally recognizing the new government . However , relations rapidly deteriorated when the new Cuban government passed the first Agrarian Reform Law to begin expropriation of large-scale ( largely American-owned ) land holdings on May 17 , 1959 . The compensation offered ( based on 20-year bonds at 4.5 % interest for the tax-assessed value ) was seen as inadequate , and was rejected by American interests . Animosity escalated with the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis . After that , the U.S. promised never to invade Cuba again , but resorted to financial measures instead . `` This embargo initially caused damage to the Cuban economy , but 45 years later , has very little effect . This is why many ( aside from GW Bush ) have called for lifting the embargo .",1

"Where does the governmnent borrow from ? people talk about the deficit , but is that money coming from ? is the government writing IOU 's to people ? ALL THE TIME ! the governement uses borrowed money fron the centrel bank to pay for all of it 's short commings . And here is a little secret : do you know that the green in your wallet is only worth the paper it is printed on ? Yes , The american peoples money is worth NOTHING ! the gold backing system wsa abandoned in the 60 's ! So all the money in the bank , and elsewhere , is worth nothing ! ( unless you have gold ) So our borowed money is jut money that the centrel pank prints out , and `` loans '' to the governement .",1
"Is the Brady Bill based on a Nazi Gun Control Law ? I was told it was the exact same - almost word for translated word . Ridiculous . Is the law requiring cars to stop at a stop sign based on a Nazi law ? Because the laws are remarkably similar to laws in Nazi Germany requiring cars to stop at stop signs . ( One group has claimed that the origin of the distinction between guns suitable for sporting use and other guns comes from Nazi Germany . And the group further claims that when the Brady Bill attempts to outlaw private ownership of semi-automatic weapons ( which are only good for killing large numbers of people quickly , in war or otherwise , or practising to do so ) it is applying this distinction first developed in Nazi law . But 1 ) that is a far cry from the Brady Bill being a `` translation '' of Nazi legislation , 2 ) the Brady Bill ban on selected semi-automatic weapons is not the same as a ban on private ownership of any weapon not suitable for sporting use , and 3 ) the concept of a ban on such weapons in private hands goes back way before the Nazis , and existed throughout Europe , back into the days of Kings and nobility . It was not invented by the Nazis.Oppose gun control if you like . But this is not a reason to do so .",1
"How do you feel about our President George Bush ? My opinion is that I do n't like him/I did not vote for him ! The terms liberal and conservative are for people who are neither . Republicans are spending $ $ $ like there 's no tommorrow . Democrates tend to vote like Republicans ( until this year , as a whole , they have supported the President like a bunch of lap dogs ) . This year , Democrates seems to have collected their courage and are standing up to the Executive Branch ( even Republicans are standing up to Bush now ! ) Even if I do n't like our President , I pray that he gets the courage and stop dishonoring to our country and tell the whole truth and ask for forgivness like a true Christian would . I really wish that Bush would lead our country away from foreign oil dependence . The fact is that the past five Presidents have said this and did nothing . I hope this Bush can honour his promise and really do something to get America out of the mess he got us in . You are exactly right . Sometimes true courage is admitting that you were wrong .",1
"I 've been deported once . It was my big mistake . But i really want to come back . Becouse i loved this country You will first need to apply for some type of immigrant or non-immigrant visa . Possibly you can be accepted into a university of some sort that will process your visa . If you have an employer who wants you to work for them , they might be willing to help you with a work visa or permanent residence . If you have an immediate family member in the US who is a resident or citizen , they can apply for you . Once that application is approved , you have to apply for a form I-212 permisson to reenter after deportation if you were deported less than five years ago . If you were only deported once and it was more than five years ago and it was n't for certain types of crimes ( you need a lawyer to figure that out ) , then you will be able to come back .

"How to fight graft and corruption ? If it is in a corporation , there are special laws to grant you whistleblower status , and you can move into this role under a degree of legal protection from retribution.If it is in a government , then it can be very difficult depending on the nature of the government . Dictatorships are notorious for systemic corruption , and there is little that can be done without coup or significant intervention ( or perhaps populist uprising , although you 'd be risking your life ) . In a democracy , the corruption is of a softer sort , and you may be able to counter-act it via a public interest campaign , or story presented to the news media.Now if the graft and corruption is within your own heart ... that 's a real toughie . It requires a degree of personal strength and conviction to ideals which extend beyond your person . I think all human beings have the capacity for such strength and compassion , but it requires a willingness to make the hard choices both for yourself and your community .",1

What is a fiscal year ? And what is the point of a fiscal year ? Like the fiscal year of the United States is October 1 - September 30 . Why not our calendar year ? Japan 's is April 1 to March 31 .

"Can Bush realistically be impeached ? Can he ? Sure . All it takes is a majority vote of the House of Representatives.Will he ? Probably not - the Republicans control the House and Senate at the moment . Clinton was impeached when the opposition party controlled Congress.Keep in mind that impeachment does not mean removal from office . Impeachment is simply the process of charging the President ( or other positions like Vice-President or judges ) with high crimes or misdemeanors . Then the Senate acts as judge and jury to try the person . If they are convicted by the Senate , they are removed from office . Any criminal charges would then involve another trial after the person is out of office .",1
"Who is Hosni Mubarak 's successor in ruling Egypt ? it is not really clear . the egyptian parliament nominates a single candidate , who is then confirmed by a referendum vote ( which is typically a massively-rigged election ) . egypt has been moving to democratize lately , but it looks to be a slow process and mubarak will likely not let much power slip from his hands.the economist seems to think that mubarak has been preparing his son , Galal Mubarak , to take over before he dies or steps down . however this has been met with public disapproval and it is not really certain just who would take over . if mubarak were to suddenly die , it would probably be a time of crisis in egypt that could either lead to a more democratic society or possibly civil war .",1

It 's the same as everywhere ; you or your b/f hurt her , you go to jail unless it 's self defense and you 'd better be able to prove it . I 'm a former police officer and if you attacked her , I would arrest you . What you need to do is to talk to the girl 's parents . She sounds obsessive and that can be dangerous . You need to document every offense , possibly video tape her doing it or recording her with a hidden tape recorder , which , in Texas , you can legally do as long as one party in the conversation is aware that it 's being taped , i.e . you or your boyfriend talking to her . If she shows up at your home , call the police . If her parents refuse to put a stop to it , go to the school principal if you are all in the same school and if need be , the police but do not lay a hand on her unless she attacks you . Where do you think sympathy might lie in a court of law ? With you and your b/f who are older , or what they would consider a child misbehaving ? Right or wrong , sympathy will be on her side because of her age . You both have to be the mature ones in this case . Do n't try to solve it on your own . Do tell her when you speak to her that you are going to call the police or go to her parents and if that does n't work , do as I instructed . It 's the safesty way for anyone .

"whats the verdict ? If I have tablet w/ voice output and I wrote something falsely accusing a person behind a sheet of cloth , the person heard my false accusation via voice generation . How would he/she sue me , slander or libel ? What Are Defamation , Libel and Slander ? Generally speaking , defamation is the issuance of a false statement about another person , which causes that person to suffer harm . Slander involves the making of defamatory statements by a transitory ( non-fixed ) representation , usually an oral ( spoken ) representation . Libel involves the making of defamatory statements in a printed or fixed medium , such as a magazine or newspaper . Typically , the elements of a cause of action for defamation include : A false and defamatory statement concerning another ; The unprivileged publication of the statement to a third party ( that is , somebody other than the person defamed by the statement ) ; If the defamatory matter is of public concern , fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher ; and Damage to the plaintiff . In the context of defamation law , a statement is `` published '' when it is made to the third party . That term does not mean that the statement has to be in print . Damages are typically to the reputation of the plaintiff , but depending upon the laws of the jurisdiction it may be enough to establish mental anguish . Most jurisdictions also recognize `` per se '' defamation , where the allegations are presumed to cause damage to the plaintiff . Typically , the following may consititute defamation per se : Attacks on a person 's professional character or standing ; Allegations that an unmarried person is unchaste ; Allegations that a person is infected with a sexually transmitted disease ; Allegations that the person has committed a crime of moral turpitude ; While actions for defamation have their roots in common law , most jurisdictions have now enacted statutes which modify the common law . They may change the elements of the cause of action , limit when an action may be filed , or modify the defenses to an action for defamation . Some may even require that the defendant be given an opportunity to apologize before the plaintiff can seek non-economic damages .",1

"What is better NonCommissioned Officers or Commissioned Officers ? ( follow-up question.. ) It all depends on what you mean by `` better . '' The officer corps are the managers of the military and are granted that rank by the President ( at least indirectly ) . Usually they are better educated , normally requiring a college degree . Have completed some sort of military training such as Officer Candidate School , the Military Academy or ROTC . This is followed by several months , typically , of training in their branch of service . The pay for officers and the breadth of their responsibilities are normally greater than those of NCOs.If the officers are the brains of the military , NCOs are the backbone . They are more specialized in their jobs and typically have less overall responsibility . However , they have worked up through the ranks and know how things work . For this reason , they supervise soldiers on a day-to-day basis to ensure objectives of 'management ' are met . They will typically have more experience than the newly commissioned lieutenant and the wise officer will solicit their input . Personally , I had more fun and a lot less politics as an NCO.Another category , between NCO and Officer , is Warrant Officer . This is a highly specialized individual normally with expert technical skills but lacking a normal commission . Examples may include some pilots . I have n't been one of these , but that seems the way to go ; - )",1

"Did the US government really steal Arizona , Texas and New Mexico ? What is your perception ? Any input ?

Others , specially politicians , say it was stolen by the US . That all really depends on your definition of `` stole . '' Technically , the Mexican government signed the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo , ceding all of the territories to which you refer in exchange for $ 15 million and ending the Mexican-American War . One could say , however , that the Mexican-American War was merely a pretext for taking all of the territory , and it is likely not far from the truth . Also , a large chunk of Arizona and a section of New Mexico were purchased after the stealing of the rest in 1853 as the Gadsden Purchase , in which the US paid Mexico $ 10 million , about $ 343,826,098 accounting for inflation .",1

"Is there such thing as a 'Dixie-crat ' anymore ? Is there a public figure who you would consider to be one ? DixieCrat was n't just a term meaning southern conservative Democrat , it was a real party ( it 's official name was the `` State 's Rights party '' ) formed as a 3rd party in 1948 , with Strom Thurmond as it 's presidential candidate . ( here was their official platform in 1948 , including segregation- http : //www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/dixiecrat1.html ) it pretty much fell apart after the 1948 election.Basically , a dixiecrat is a person that stands by the old line democrat platform of segregationist policies ( the Democrats used to be the conservative party , and the Republican party was the progressive party- this started to change between the election cycles of 1932 and 1940 with FDR ) - the dixiecrats were formed in response to Truman 's integration of the armed services and the overall democrat civil rights plank.Basically in answer to your question , no there really are n't any people around anymore that believe in the Democratic party but are against it 's policies . Even `` yellow dog '' Democrats are no longer the type of people that support the party without supporting it 's causes . The death knell for the dixiecrats was when Thurmond switched over to the Republican party ... the rest fell in line behind him like dominos .",1

"what is the begining of israel and palastine conflict ? why could n't it be stopped ? Complex problems usually do n't have simple answers ( like 'they tried to throw the Palestinians out ) .For over 3,000 years , Jews have held the Land of Israel to be their homeland , both as a Holy Land and as a Promised Land . The Land of Israel holds a special place in Jewish religious obligations , encompassing Judaism 's most important sites — including the remains of the First and Second Temple , as well as the rites concerning those temples . [ 2 ] Starting around 1200 BCE , a series of Jewish kingdoms and states existed intermittently in the region for over a millennium . Recent archeological evidence suggests that the kingdoms of King David and King Solomon may have existed . [ 3 ] Under Babylonian , Greek , Roman , Byzantine , and ( briefly ) Sassanian rule , Jewish presence in the province dwindled due to mass expulsions . In particular , the failure of the Bar Kochba Revolt against the Roman Empire resulted in widescale expulsion of Jews . It was during this time that the Romans gave the name Syria Palaestina to the geographic area , in an attempt to erase Jewish ties to the land . The Mishnah and Jerusalem Talmud , two of Judaism 's most important religious texts , were composed in the region during this period . The Arabs conquered the land from the Eastern Roman Empire in 638 CE . The area was ruled by various Arab states ( interrupted by the rule of the Crusaders ) before becoming part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517.Throughout the centuries , the size of the Jewish population in the land fluctuated widely . Circa 1881 , in the region approximating present-day Israel , the Jewish population numbered approximately 20–25,000 of a total population of 470,000 . [ citation needed ] Since 1844 , in Jerusalem the Jews have constituted the largest of several ethno-religious groups . [ citation needed ] By 1896 , they were an absolute majority of the populationThe rise of Nazism in 1933 led to a fifth wave of Aliyah . The Jews in the region increased from 11 % of the population in 1922 to 30 % by 1940 . The subsequent Holocaust in Europe led to additional immigration from other parts of Europe . By the end of World War II , the number of Jews in Palestine was approximately 600,000.In 1939 , the British abandoned the idea of a Jewish national home , and abandoned partition and negotiations in favour of the White Paper of 1939 , which limited Jewish immigration and restricted purchase of land by Jews . Its other stated policy was to establish a system under which both Jews and Arabs were to share one government . The plan was never fully implemented because of a combination of resistance from the Jews and Arabs and Britain 's pre-occupation with Europe and World War II . However , the White Paper guided British policy until the end of the term of their Mandate . As a result , many Jews fleeing to Palestine to avoid Nazi persecution and the holocaust were intercepted and returned to Europe . Two specific examples of this policy involved the ships Struma and Exodus [ 4 ] . These attempts by Jews to circumvent the blockade and flee Europe became known as Aliya Beth.In 1947 , following increasing levels of violence by militant groups together with unsuccessful efforts to reconcile the Jewish and Arab populations , the British government decided to withdraw from the Palestine Mandate . The UN General Assembly approved the 1947 UN Partition Plan dividing the territory into two states , Jewish and Arab , giving about half the land area to each state . Jerusalem was planned to be an international region administered by the UN to avoid conflict over its status.Immediately following the adoption of the Partition Plan by the UN General Assembly ( on November 29 , 1947 ) , the Arab leadership rejected the plan and launched a guerilla war that included attacks on Jewish civilians . The Irgun Tsvai Leumi retaliated with attacks on Arabs , including Arab civilians.On May 14 , 1948 , before the expiry of the British Mandate of Palestine at midnight of May 15 , 1948 ,",1

You should contact your credit card company to follow up and ask what they 'll do to press charges against the one who defrauded you , if they know who he is . It 's more up to them to decide at this point , since they hold the information and the control , and since it 's mostly in their best interest .

"Who decides what is politically correct ? Support your answer please . Politically correct is a term that I think refers to respect for minorities . It 's basically a way of speaking that attempts to respect others by adopting the same language they use when referring to themselves , or the issues that are of most importance to them . It is a reflection of our national values of equality and equal rights.Because of the nature of opression , majority groups such as Men , Christians and Whites are usually much less affected by slurs , racism , etc , because they are not living with the legacy of discrimination and opression in the recent past.To answer the question , I would say that the minorities themselves would be the ones who decide what is and is not disrespectful , racist , or politically correct from their perspective.For example , many black people prefer to be called `` African Americans '' rather than black or negro or other such words . Some of those worlds have been used throughout our history and are strongly connected with opression and discrimination . Knowing this , we can choose to respect those wishes and adopt that speech , or we can reject it outright.Asian-Americans may feel that being called `` oriental '' is offensive to them , as the word has it has taken on a negative historical connotation , in books and spoken words throuought the years.Women might find it offensive to be called `` the little lady '' or `` girls '' , as this may harken back to a time when people thought of women as inferior to men or needing of male guidance , so they prefer to be called women.Basically I think that political correctness is a choice that you make to respect or disrespect minorities when you are discussing issues of race or gender in public .",1

"How do you like President Bush ? ? ? He 's a power hungry , cronyist puppet of the far right neocon movement . He 's a demagogue , and he is n't very smart . He thinks he 's above the law , he panders to the prevailing winds of evangelical Christianity even though the neoconservative movement stinks to Heaven of nihilism , egocentrism , atheism and cynicism.He is the choice of a party which tries to expound , at every opportunity , on the evils of big government and centralized social programs all while racking up a monsterous deficit on missile defense shields born of broken treaties . Upon breaking our nuclear proliferation treaties , we wonder why rogue nations in the rest of the world want to do the same . His spendthrift attitude is causing inflation , and it 's crowding much needed private investment out of our manufacturing sector . His failure to enforce the laws which keep the capitalist system of this country running have led to price gouging of fuels , and that 's compounding our economic troubles . Under his administration , we have made several cuts to energy subsidies for the poor ( which he promised not to do while campaigning ) , and in the face of his carefree attitude towards the illegal activities of the oil companies , people have frozen to death in their homes.The manufacturing in the military-industrial sector combined with a purely reactionary attitude towards environmentalism has led to a toxic level of perchlorates in the breast milk of almost ALL of the women tested for it . We ca n't even set up a control group because everyone is so laden with perchlorates . Perchlorates cause brain damage in nursing children.His budgets allocate federal funds for private , religious organizations.In violation of the due process of the law and our long held principles which prohibit unlawful search and seazure , he has the NSA spy on Americans and subpeonas search engines to find out what everyone in the country is searching for.He abandons science in favor of ideology . He refuses to heed the warnings of climatologists . His hostile attitude towards medicine and biology is threatening the very foundations of American industry , innovation and science . His cronies are trying to censor and suppress scientific journals which give sound evidence to something that should be intuitively obvious -- logging does n't help forests recover from forest fire.He was an alcoholic and a cokehead until he was 40 . His `` choice '' to become President was made when , according to him , he realized that he `` was 40 and wondering what to do with his life . '' He is in office only because Americans have strayed so far from their liberal founding principles that they would rather see a dynastic succession of aristocracy than a government of scholars and public servants.He abandoned Afghanistan , where the terrorists were and are , to take us to war in Iraq , where they are n't . He lied to do this . After doing that , his administration gave no-bid contracts to Halliburton , whose former CEO is now your vice-president . The price of doing this is that we are now unable to deal with a growing threat in Iran , and while only a few years ago we were berating the international community and the UN Security Council , the best we can now manage is to threaten to refer Iran to the UN Security Council.Under his administration , we have begun to use the CIA to fly people who are only suspected of something to old Soviet facilities where we torture them . We hold people for long periods of time without charging them with a crime.He pushed an energy bill through congress which relaxes the efficiency requirements for coal burning power plants .

"why was the square deal so important ? During the 1904 campaign , Roosevelt called his actions in the coal miners ' strike a `` square deal '' for both labor and capital , a term that stuck to his administration . Roosevelt was not the first president to take a stand for labor , but he was the first to bring opposing sides in a labor dispute to the White House to settle it . He was the first to threaten to seize a major industry , and he was the first to appoint a commission whose decision both sides agreed to accept . `` Let the watchwords of all our people be the old familiar watchwords of honesty , decency , fair-dealing , and commonsense . '' ... `` We must treat each man on his worth and merits as a man . We must see that each is given a square deal , because he is entitled to no more and should receive no less . '' ... `` The welfare of each of us is dependent fundamentally upon the welfare of all of us . '' —Roosevelt , New York State Fair , Syracuse , New York , September 7 , 1903 . The idea behind the Square Deal was to be fair to every citizen in the United States . To create this fairness , corporations and the average citizen had to be equal . To achieve this equality , President Roosevelt created a series of laws and programs aimed at rebalancing the balance of power between labor , consumer , and safety interests against business , manufacturers and profit.To ensure market competition , President Roosevelt built into the Square Deal program the concepts that monopolies were wrong and that business should not cut corners to the point where public health is jeopordized . When consumer buying power has no means to induce change via market competition , chances are the corporation would cut costs or corners to achieve a higher profit via deceptive practices , poor quality control , or polluting methods , at the expense of the consumers health or lives.So a square deal had to be instituted to ensure that business cost cutting measures have a limit . To achieve this goal , extreme cost cutting measures , wanton corruption and instability had to be brought under contol . Railroads were no longer allowed to give rebates or kickbacks to favored companies . Meat had to be processed safely with proper santitation , and people were allowed to breathe the fresh air of national parks . Foods and drugs could no longer be mislabeled , nor could consumers be delierately misled to make a profit . Businesses were forced to accept the additional cost of these reforms as a part of the their cost of doing business .",1

"Should car be banned in city centre ? Please give me the reason and more details because I need to write a arguement essay on it . Well , there are two sides to this issue - I do n't know if you are arguing in favor , or against it - so here goes.On the plus side ( i.e . banning cars in the city center ) , you would reduce traffic , congestion , wear and tear on the streets . You could hold events ( parades , celebrations , rally 's , etc . ) in the area without significantly affecting traffic . Also , car-free areas in the downtown ( i.e . city center ) can help to revitalize an area of the downtown - it can be made to look nice , maybe with something like nice bricks , or cobblestones.On the other hand ( against banning cars in the city center ) , if you ban cars in the downtown area , you 'll be loosing revenue from on-street parking and any parking tickets the city issues , depending upon the size of the car-free area , it will be more difficult to get to the city center , it might adversely affect sales for businesses in the affected area.One option , used in downtown Minneapolis ( Nicollet Mall ) allows taxis and busses , but not private ( i.e . car ) traffic . This allows people to get down to the area via public transportation , or by taking a taxi .

"Why is marijuana illegal while tobacco continues to kill and get rich ? `` Until 1937 , consumption and sale of cannabis was legal in most American states . In some areas it could be openly purchased in bulk from grocers or in cigarette form at newsstands , though an increasing number of states had begun to outlaw it . In that year , federal law made possession or transfer of cannabis ( without the purchase of a by-then-incriminating tax stamp ) illegal throughout the United States . This was contrary to the advice of the American Medical Association at the time . Legal opinions of the time held that the federal government could not outlaw it entirely . The tax was $ 100 per pound of hemp , even for clothes or rope . The expense , extremely high for that time , was such that people stopped openly buying and making it.The decision of the U.S. Congress was based in part on testimony derived from articles in the newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst , who was heavily interested in DuPont Inc . Some analysts theorize DuPont wanted to boost declining post-war textile sales , and wished to eliminate hemp fiber as competition . Many argue that this seems unlikely given DuPont 's lack of concern with the legal status of cotton , wool , and linen ; although it should be noted that hemp 's textile potential had not yet been largely exploited , while textile factories already had made large investments in equipment to handle cotton , wool , and linen . Others argue that Dupont wanted to eliminate cannabis because its high natural cellulose content made it a viable alternative to the company 's developing innovation : modern plastic . Still , others could argue that hemp could never truly compete with the high strength and elasticity of synthetics , such as nylon . Furthermore , hemp would have been an easy target due to its intoxicating effect , while no rational justification could have been made for outlawing cotton , wool , or linen .

"Should the government grant legal status to 10 million illegal immigrants currently living in the US ?

"Since reparations has been given due to past crimes against humanity should n't African Americans receive also ? Due to slavery and 400 yr+ of oppression also the unequal treatment of blacks in America due to White supremacy and injustice . Reparations in the United States have generally been limited to the survivors of government harm . Watch your terminology , though - slavery was not a crime until 1865 , since the government permitted slavery and only outlawed it through the Thirteenth Amendment after the Civil War.For instance , the United States paid survivors of Japanese internment programs from WWII . The program , however , was limited to survivors . No survivors of slavery exist today.A current reparations program would be too bizarre to fathom . All African-Americans were not harmed by slavery , after all , since some immigrated to America after slavery , or since some have no slave ancestors . It would be virtually impossible to require proof of slave ancestry , and then to divide some sum proportionately.Additionally , the vague `` 400 yr+ of oppression '' is unhelpful in crafting legislation . Slavery ended . Segregation did exist also , that 's ended for over 50 years now . If you 're problem with `` White supremacy and injustice , '' then I 'm afraid that no amount of money will solve the problem . Instead , educating future generations and winning over hearts and minds is the most effective remedy to injustice .",1

"why the police is not cancelling the driver 's lic of D U I ? Wow ! The police do not actually cancel the driver 's license . Not local police.The State Highway Patrol actually terminate your license . A court will normally decide on the suspension of a license for other than a non-payment of a annual license fee . The officer of the law simply writes the Citation , the `` Ticket '' . The State Police or Highway Patrol is the Agency responsible for the issue and control statewide for the license , and will simply carry out the orders of the Court . The `` Court '' is simply a Judge . Local Police do not ordinarily carry out these duties , but if a Judge so orders they will so act . Really nothing is unusual about it.So the Police Officer can give you a break only at the time when he is writing the Citation , or just prior to actual Court . Once a decision by a Judge has been rendered , it is out of the Officer 's hands . HE CAN NOT CANCEL ANYTHING ! APS",1
"why is the child support system not more fair to the fathers who are in their child ` s life ? What cheermom stated demonstrates that there are similarities between California and Iowa . The point to keep in mind is that the Child Support Systems are usually divided into multiple sections . For those who work with individuals involved in the various cases , those who look out for the interests of the children , those are involved in the getting payments form the State to the primary care giver of the child , and those who collect money owed by a parent of record who is mandated by the court to make payments . These departments must follow the orders of the court . That is , a parent who is working to be involved in the life of the child is a great thing , but if they are not paying their court ordered child support payments , these departments have no choice but to act for the court and collect the funds from the delinquent parent . If a parent disagrees with the amount owed ( for whatever reason ) , their argument is not with the State departments but with the court and they must go back to the court to have a new order issued.Here in Iowa they will go after the delinquent parent irregardless of their job position and this includes working with other States . Only the court can change this reality.I realize that it can be frustrating , but the parents are best served if they do not try to mix things such as visitations and child support payments , the courts view them as two different actions .",1

"Any economists out there ? Student who needs help ! ! ? I 'm in college , & need help with my macroeconomics class . I took a quiz , and got 5 questions wrong . My teacher is disputing that they 're wrong , but I say they 're right ! ! Thank you in advance for your help . The questions are : The ability-to-pay tax principle ca n't be applied to : ( she said the correct answer was welfare ) . The ability to pay tax principle states that : Those with a greater ability to pay ( such as those with a higher income , or those who own more property ) should pay more taxes . I do n't see how welfare ( or her other choices of post office , & highway ) fit into this principle . Yes , we as users of the highway & post offices pay taxes , ( these services are supplied by the government ) but people that use welfare also pay taxes . The only way I can see this to be a part of it , is that highways can make money by tolls & post offices by postage , & welfare is giving money away to citizens . Thank you , and I have 4 more , but no space to post , so I 'm going to do individual questions . Welfare is essentially a negative tax , which goes right in hand with the ability-to-pay tax principle . They so lack an ability to pay that they are instead paid by the Social Security Insurance tax that everyone who can pay does .",1

Is it at all like when then started calling ppl communists see now its like we are all suspect in everything we do.I am deeply upset that we focus so much on the american ppl and so little on the borderland .

"What are the differences between Communism and Socialism ? I want to know the basic differences . And please , do n't make this up . The quick 'n ' easy way to remember the difference between Socialism and Communism is : Socialism is `` from each according to their ability , to each according to their DEEDS , '' whereas Communism is `` from each according to their ability to each according to their NEEDS . '' Socialism is the stage between Capitalism and Communism . It builds upon the previous system ( Capitalism ) by nationalizing the `` means of production '' ( i.e . corporations , resources , banks , etc . ) , but not by making everyone equal . In other words , people will be paid wages based on several factors ( social need , difficulty , amount of schooling required , etc . ) , so not everyone will make the same wage -- as is often a misinterpretation of Socialism . Communism is the point where the state `` withers away . '' In other words , it 's quite a few years in the future . If I had to guess , I 'd say at least 10 generations of established Socialism has to occur before people evolve enough to realize that hurting others or the system ends up hurting themselves . As Communists we advocate Socialism because it is the next necessary step to get to Communism . In other words , it 's not that we 've given up on building a house , we just realize there is a need for a sturdy foundation first . Communists believe in human evolution . We evolve in accordance to the system we live within . Capitalism has allowed us to evolve out of our feudalistic ways ( for the most part ) , and slavery does not exist in our country anymore ( for the most part ) . But Capitalism , which is driven by the need to always increase profits , founders a `` dog eat dog '' mentality . This is not a sustainable system , either for humankind or for the environment . Under Socialism people will evolve to the point where they care about each other regardless of their location or race or whatever . If we are to survive as a species , we need to evolve . That 's one of the many reasons I 'm a Communist . Finally , one misconception people often have about Communism is that we are looking to make everyone poor . On the contrary , we want everyone to enjoy as much as possible the fruits of our vast wealth .",1
"What is the easiest way to get my wife a visa for entry to america ? If you are a US citizen and she is outside the US , you should apply for a K visa . Depending on where you live , it will take from one month to approximately five months to process . It is a relatively simple application and you can fill it out youself online at www.uscis.gov . You should include some information that proves your relationship with her is not a fraudulent one , like pictures of your wedding , a letter explaining how you met and dated and why you decided to marry . Especially helpful are any children you have together or financial documents in both names . After she is here , she can apply for her permanent residence . I would suggest an attorney for that process because it involves a lot of paperwork , some of which is a bit complicated .",1

Shortly thereafter is when you see all these attack start against America.The reason why America does this stuff wether you agree or disagree is oil . People told Bush 1 you have to go out there and say you are doing this for the people of Kuwait but the real reson was oil and we ca n't tell the American people that.Remember no blood for oil ? I never believed it , until the last few months when I saw on History Channel people who advised Bush 1 saying thats what happened.They are n't that bad over there . They just hate us cause we get in the way of their making profit with oil .

"Do non-smokers have rights too ? Yes , you non-smokers have rights too , but you give them away by allowing : 1 ) Smoking to be LEGAL , & 2 ) By allowing extra taxation on cigarettes to benefit all Americans . When will American ’ s stop being hypocrites to smokers by rapping smokers of their money and health and then yelling at smokers for providing tax money to all of America ? If we truly cared about America we would find ways to make tobacco illegal and give up the revenue from tobacco.PS : I have not had a cigarette for 12 Days . . . No I ’ m not moody from withdrawals , I just think American ’ s are hypocrites when it comes to smokers . Sin/Use taxes are somewhat better than illegalizing sin/use completely . At least then the ills caused by the sin or damage by the use are paid for by those doing the sin/use . Example : Road use..polution.. gas tax , is both a use and sin tax . Still Illegalizing sin is somewhat ( arguably ) better than flaunting immoral activities to our children . Sins will never be black or white issues they will allways be subjective .

"When and how will U.S. Congress and the White House succeed in destroying the Middle Class American ?

"How is `` Evolution '' plausible or logical ? Simply because Darwin used well developed ( by humans , but well developed nonetheless ) , well proven , scientific methodolgy instead of relying on the dogmas of a belief system to base his observations on.Keep in mind that , in science , there are very few laws any longer . Everything is a theory because , especially after relativity , scientists discovered that our universe does n't stay consistent as you move into and out of certain states ( like the speed of light ) . However , this does not eliminate the theory as quackery or false . It means that the theory can only be applied in certain circumstances ( it 's relative to certain states ) so it can not be a `` law '' as laws are immutable.That being said , science only has observable evidence as it 's foundation ( or provable evidence through mathematics ) . Darwin observed the various species on the Galapagos islands and drew conclusions as to the nature of their adaptations ( long beaks , short beaks , etc. ) . He also observed that various birds with nearly identical characteristics had slight variations in their adaptations . This caused him to draw other conclusions . In short , he used a scientific process to develop early versions of his theory of evolution . It has been scrutinized since , and the only ones `` disproving '' it have been those who belive religious texts are God 's absolute word.I am a believer in Christ , yet I see no issue with believing there is truth to Darwin 's theories . Did God ultimately create all things ? Of course He did . However , is the Bible absolute in it 's description in the origins of life ? Probably not . Even Christ , according to the biblical record , spoke in stories ( parables ) most of the time so people would understand his message and have examples to work from . He rarely spoke in absolutes , and when he did it was usually only with the apostles.I belive that Genesis is a parable describing God 's creation of all that is , in an understandable way since it is unlikely that we will ever completely understand how He did it . However , even I admit it is only a belief , and may be wrong , like Darwin may be wrong , or literal interpretations of Genesis may be wrong .",1
"Will unfounded domestic violence charge hold up in court in Va ? My husband and I were arguing in our apartment and the neighbors called the police . We were alreay in the process of `` making up '' . The police came and interviewed him and visualy saw marks on me from the `` making up '' . The police arrested him for domestic violence and said that the state of Virginia would charge him for it not the city . They never took a statement from me nor pictures . From the time my husband got arrested to his release back to me took 45 min . He litterly walked in the back door did some paperwork and walked out the front.What are the odds that he will be found guilty with only the testamony of the officer and me testifying and telling my story in defense of my husband in the state of Va. You know , I suspect you 're not going to get many takers on this one . You 've got a lot of issues here that are very involved and nobody who knows what they are talking about is going to be able to give you an answer based on the `` facts '' you 've presented here.Rather than try to answer your question , let me ask you some more : What do you define as arguing ? Was it strictly verbal or was there any physical touching whatsoever ? Were any threats of any kind made during the argument ? You said the police saw marks on you from `` making up '' ... which , frankly , is very suspicious to an old cop like me . But the question is , what kind of marks ? Are you talking about a hickey or a bruise ? When the police interviewed your husband , what did he say ? Did he perhaps admit to doing something that would have violated the law in your state ? And please - if you did not personally hear the interview between your husband and the police , you do not *know* what was said ... you might know what your husband told you later , but if you did n't hear it for yourself , you do n't know.Do n't know if you 're asking a question about the city or the state prosecuting , but if you are : not unusual for the state to prosecute a domestic violence charge , even if the victim denies it or changes their story later.If you told the police the marks on you were from `` making up '' , then they did take a statement from you . Once you said that , the police may have felt that was all the statement they were going to get out of you - especially if the marks they saw were not consistent with what you said was `` making up '' ( for example : most people do n't make up by leaving bruises , swollen lips , scratches , black eyes , etc ... if those are the marks you 're talking about , I 'm with the cops on this one ) .If you had marks , the police certainly should have taken photos of them . Some types of minor injuries do n't show well in photos ( especially depending on the equipment ) so they may not have thought photos were worthwhile or they just simply did n't take them . What were your `` marks '' ? You 're asking what the odds are that he 'll be found guilty based on what you say is the officer 's testimony and your statement in defense of your husband . Ca n't answer that one because neither you nor I have all the facts , I suspect.What did the neighbors say ( or more importantly , do the neighbors have something to say ; did they hear threats , did they hear physical violence , did they hear you say something that would suggest you were being victimized ) ? What did he say ? Maybe without meaning to , he admitted to a crime . He would n't be the first person to do so ... and if the cops were skillful interviewers , they may have obtained an admission or confession from him without him realizing he was doing so.What is the crime of domestic violence in Virginia ? You were smart to include that you 're in that state because it certainly makes a difference ( and unfortunately , I 'm not from there ) .Do the police know you and your husband ? Either of you been arrested for domestic violence before ? Bottom line : way too many `` what-if 's '' for anyone to give you an educated answer to your question . Depending on the answers to the questions I 've asked , the chances of him being found guilty could be very good , or very poor.And finally : I 've investigated domestic violence crimes for over 18 years as a police officer . I hope everything you wrote here is absolutely true ... that you were not the victim of domestic violence , and that you are as safe today as the day you were born . I hope nobody ever lays a hand on you , threatens you , or abuses you . However , what you 've written here ( and what I suspect your answers to some of my questions might be ) is some of the most commonly-expressed statements I 've heard from domestic violence vi",1

"name the us possessions and territories ? A History of United States Insular Areas : How the Relationships Began From 1899 to 1941 , Guam was under U.S . Naval Administration . At the outbreak of World War II , the Japanese seized Guam and occupied the island for two and a half years . American forces recaptured Guam in July 1944 , and the U.S . Naval Administration resumed responsibility when peace returned.In 1950 , the U.S. Government enacted the Guam Organic Act , conferring U.S. citizenship on the people of Guam and establishing local self-government . Under the Organic Act of 1950 , the Secretary of the Interior assumed administrative responsibility for Guam , formerly vested in the Secretary of the Navy.The United States purchased the Virgin Islands for $ 25 million from Denmark in 1917 . The Virgin Islands were placed under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy until they were transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1931.Interior 's relationship with other U.S.-affiliated Pacific islands stemmed from a post-World War II trusteeship . The Northern Mariana Islands , the Marshall , Palau , Yap , Kosrae , Chuuk and Pohnpei Islands were grouped into the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands ( TTPI ) by the United Nations in 1947 . Under the Trusteeship Agreement with the U.N. Security Council , the United States exercised administrative jurisdiction over the TTPI.The Navy administered the TTPI until 1951 , when that authority was given to the Secretary of the Interior . During those initial years of authority , the Secretary of the Interior exercised broad administrative authority in all the insular areas . Chief executives of the insular governments were appointees of the President or the Secretary and the Secretary had the legal authority to supervise and give binding directions to them.However , this is no longer the case . Popularly elected legislatures ( Guam-1950 , USVI-1954 , American Samoa-1961 , and the CNMI-1979 ) and governors ( Guam and USVI 1971 , American Samoa 1978 , the CNMI , 1979 ) were established . Each of the U.S. insular areas has become responsible for the administration of local government functions . Although the Congress has placed with the Secretary , certain continuing budget and program coordination authority and responsibility concerning U.S. insular affairs , the local governments are not entities of the Department , nor are they agencies or instrumentalities of the Federal Government.Except for CNMI , which became a commonwealth of the U.S. , the remaining TTPI entities chose a dramatically different political status.On May l , l979 , the United States recognized the Constitution of the Marshall Islands and the establishment of the Government of the Marshall Islands ( RMI ) . The United States recognized the Federated States of Micronesia ( FSM ) constitution in 1979 and establishment of the Government of the FSM , both national and state levels . FSM created the 4 State levels from the islands of Yap , Chuuk , Pohnpei and Kosrae.On October 1 , 1994 , the Compact of Free Association between the United States and Palau entered into force , ( U.S. Public Law 99-658 ) . The Compact entered into force for the Marshall Islands on October 2l , l986 , ( Presidential Proclamation No . 5564 ) . The FSM Compact was fully implemented on November 3 , 1986 ( Presidential Proclamation No . 5564 ) .Under the Compact , the status of free association recognizes each Freely Associated State as a sovereign state with the capacity to conduct foreign affairs consistent with the terms of the Compact . The Compact places full responsibility for defense with the United States . The Compact also provides grant funds and Federal program assistance , principally through the Department of the Interior.Under the Compact , the State Department is responsible for government-to-government relations , while Interior is responsible for the oversight and coordination of U.S. programs and funding assistance.District of ColumbiaAmerican SamoaGuamPuerto RicoNorthern Marianas",1

"Would Americans like for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state ? Puerto Rico has been a colony for more than 100 years of the US and once again the isue has come up to decide for its political future , independence or statehood .

During the Korean War ( 1950-1953 ) , the 65th Infantry Division , made up entirely of Puerto Ricans , kicked some seroius North Korean behinds .

"Why are people considered racist if they do n't want illegal Mexicans in america even if they are ok withlegals People are often dubbed Racist if they support tougher immigration laws.If someone is angry at illegal Mexicans but ok with legal ones the are not racist.Lets face facts people at least 70 % of illegal immigration comes from Mexico.Those who propose tougher border laws are not big bad bigots , they are patriots wishing to protect this country and its economy and security . What exactly is `` handed off '' to illegal immigrants ? The general assumption that illegal immigrants are here to take what 's rightfully yours is as racist as it is ignorant.Immigrants ( legal or not ) come here looking for better opportunities and quality of life.Illegal immigrants are faced with hardships you could n't understand unless you became one . They are forced to work two and three different jobs making less than minimum wage and are taken advantage of because of their legal status.What 's ironic is that they pay taxes just like you and me.So ... they work harder for less money and on top of that pay taxes that pay the salaries of those politicians so thirsty to kick them out of the country.Going back to the original question ; those that do n't want illegal mexicans in this country are not racists . They just find it hypocritical that a group of people braking the law ( a federal one at that ) are protected by some politicians just to gain popular acceptance.To those of you that share the asker 's opinion that illegal immigrants are a threat to `` this country and its economy and security '' , I ask - how has illegal immigration affected you directly ? Did anybody get your dream job because they would do it for less money ? Did anybody get the low rent apartment you wanted ? ****** stoop_fer_lyfe ******I DO KNOW what I 'm talking about . I also live in a community riddled with illegal immigrants and am very close to many of them.What you fail to understand is that they buy new cars , buy houses or apartments and have credit cards - all things that need a credit report . Banks have changed credit requirements to accommodate them because financial institutions are not immigration officers , they are in business to make money and are not braking any law by lending money to someone that can provide Income Tax Returns . It may also be hard for you to believe that the government - regardless of the red flags it raises - accepts those Tax Returns and turns a blind eye to the migration legality of the issuer ; again , the IRS is not responsible for policing immigration laws.Maybe you have never filed a tax return , but you do n't need an employer to report and pay taxes for you . You are then 'Self-Employed ' , and you do n't necessarily need to report all your income since it ca n't be proved.Illegal immigrants know they can live very 'normal ' lives as long as they do n't break any laws other than immigration laws.It seems to me you are the one that DOES NOT KNOW what you are talking about and are merely commenting on what is fed to you by alarmist media . **************I actually enjoy these friendly exchanges.I realized why we are talking about two different illegal immigrants . You are talking about those that cross over illegally ( sneak in the country ) and I 'm talking about those that came here on a visa ( any kind ) and overstayed.The Social Security Administration used to provide SSN cards/numbers to people on temporary visas ; they were stamped with a big 'Not for employment use ' . I do n't have to tell you how easy those cards were to duplicate . I even saw a used car salesman photocopy one , remove those words and photocopy again until he ended with a 'clean ' copy before submitting the loan.On the subject of taxes ... during my college years I worked as a computer consultant , doing odd jobs that payed under $ 550 at a time , that way my 'employer ' did not have to submit a 1099 for professional services . I stayed under the radar and expensed every pencil , calculator , computer part , tool , etc . that I bought during those years .

"principle of subsidiarity whay does mean ? SubsidiaritySubsidiarity is the idea that matters should be handled by the lowest competent authority . The Oxford English Dictionary defines subsidiarity as the idea that a central authority should have a subsidiary function , performing only those tasks which can not be performed effectively at a more immediate or local level . The concept is applicable in the fields of government , political science , cybernetics , and the management of large organizations . Subsidiarity is , ideally or in principle , one of the features of federalism . The word subsidiarity is derived from the Latin word subsidiarius and has its origins in Catholic social teaching . It is found in several constitutions around the world ( see for example the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ) . It is presently best known as a fundamental principle of European Union law . According to this principle , the EU may only act ( i.e . make laws ) where member states agree that action of individual countries is insufficient . The principle was established in the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht , and is contained within the proposed new Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe . Catholic social teaching The principle of subsidiarity holds that government should undertake only those initiatives which exceed the capacity of individuals or private groups acting independently . The principle is based upon the autonomy and dignity of the human individual , and holds that all other forms of society , from the family to the state and the international order , should be in the service of the human person . Subsidiarity assumes that these human persons are by their nature social beings , and emphasizes the importance of small and intermediate-sized communities or institutions , like the family , the church , and voluntary associations , as mediating structures which empower individual action and link the individual to society as a whole . `` Positive subsidiarity '' , which is the ethical imperative for communal , institutional or governmental action to create the social conditions necessary to the full development of the individual , such as the right to work , decent housing , health care , etc. , is another important aspect of the subsidiarity principle . The principle of subsidiarity was developed in the encyclical Rerum Novarum of 1891 by Pope Leo XIII , as an attempt to articulate a middle course between the perceived excesses of laissez-faire capitalism on the one hand and the various forms of totalitarianism , which subordinate the individual to the state , on the other . The principle was further developed in Pope Pius XI 's encyclical Quadragesimo Anno of 1931 , and Economic Justice for All by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops . Quadragesimo Anno In the encyclical Quadragesimo Anno , Pope Pius specifically said at paragraphs 79 and 80 : 79 . As history abundantly proves , it is true that on account of changed conditions many things which were done by small associations in former times can not be done now save by large associations . Still , that most weighty principle , which can not be set aside or changed , remains fixed and unshaken in social philosophy : Just as it is gravely wrong to take from individuals what they can accomplish by their own initiative and industry and give it to the community , so also it is an injustice and at the same time a grave evil and disturbance of right order to assign to a greater and higher association what lesser and subordinate organizations can do . For every social activity ought of its very nature to furnish help to the members of the body social , and never destroy and absorb them.80 . The supreme authority of the State ought , therefore , to let subordinate groups handle matters and concerns of lesser importance , which would otherwise dissipate its efforts greatly . Thereby the State will more freely , powerfully , and effectively do all those things that belong to it alone because it alone can do them : directing , watching , urging , rest",1

"If Catholıc are donatıng a huge amount of money to charıtıes , why there always a NEWS of HUNGER ın the world Not all charities deal with hunger . The catholic church is a frequent location for the donations . The church has numerous employees at every church as well as support staff at the diocese level and at the Vatican . Most of these staff members are salaried while the Priests & etc have most of their expenses paid for through these donations . The staff members are to be treated like members of any business and receive pension and health care adding additional costs . Other costs that individual churches have include heating and cooling costs . If you think your heating bills are bad , think of a large building with lots of windows and doors frequently being opened.The church itself has numerous missions besides just feeding the hungry . Frequently churches have nurses on staff to visit the elderly home bound and others who may need help in administering special medication and can not afford nursing homes or a onsite nurse . There are frequently nuns on paid staff that visit the ill , the dying , etc . Some churches have other ministries as well depending on the local area . Catholics are also big on right to life and spend considerable resources attempting to deny people 's right to choose . They are also suppose to be opposed to the death penalty and also working against the archaic penalty but is nomally the work of a few individuals.All of these different things I have mentioned are just a few of the items that the church works on as well as hunger . That being said , Catholics are individuals and also give to other charities that they have personal interests in . From cancer research to colleges , it all stretches the dollar even further.Everywhere I have been , the protestants have tended to have much more open pocketbooks . It may have something to do with the silly notion that catholics have that every sperm is sacred and thus have more kids . The point is , everyone overlooks the most needy , not just Catholics .",1

"I was in a wreck with a state highway department car and totalled my car . how long should it take to resolve ? I was in a car wreck with a state highway deparment person . It was his fault . my car was totalled . How long should it take to process my claim ? they said up to 6 months since personal injury was involved , but a friend said that it would n't take that long and after a certain period of time , they arent liable anymore . so my question is basically how long should it take ? It really depends . Public entities do not work very fast . If you need to resolve your claim , not so much fast , but faster , you should file a claim with your own insurance company . Once you settle your claim with your own insurance company , your insurance company will subrogate the claim and go after the `` highway department '' for the money they paid you . So long as you are paid what you are owed by your insurance company , the highway department may drag their feet as long as they like . Hope that helps .",1

"who is the president of armenia ? Robert Kocharian ( Armenian : Ռոբերտ Քոչարյան ) ( born August 31 , 1954 ) is the second president of the third republic of Armenia.Kocharian was born in Stepanakert , Nagorno-Karabakh , at that time a region of the Azerbaijan SSR . After becoming president of Nagorno-Karabakh in 1994 , he became Prime Minister of Armenia in 1997 . In April 1998 , he replaced Levon Ter-Petrossian as President of Armenia.He was a Communist Party official during the Soviet era but is no longer a member of any political party . Under Kocharian , Armenia has experienced stability and growth and the emigration rampant under Ter-Petrossian has been reduced . He has also taken a realistic stance in the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.His re-election during 2003 was marred by allegations of electoral fraud against both candidates , though most experts contend that any irregularities were not enough to sway the outcome . There were sporadic calls for Kocharian 's resignation in early 2004 with opposition-led demonstrators taking to the streets in support of demands for a referendum of confidence in him.Kocharian and his wife , Bella Kocharian , have three children .",1

"What do you think of President Bush sellin our ports to Arabs ? Update : `` He became aware of it over the last several days , '' McClellan said . Asked if Bush did not know about it until it was a done deal , McClellan said , `` That 's correct . `` First of all , I just want to say that it 's obvious not `` all Arabs are terrorists '' and objection to this port deal is not suggesting in the least bit that they are . You see a lot of the educated Congressmen , of both parties , objecting to the sale of these ports to a UAE company . These are intelligent , educated people and you think that they are objecting to this deal because they believe that all Arabs are terrorists ? I think not . The first perons who answered this question is the one who needs to get educated.It is justifiable to say that giving control of these major US ports to a company in the UAE poses a threat to national security . This situation is comparable to the notion of `` probable cause . '' If a police officer sees a person driving dangerously and erratically he has reason to believe that this person might be intoxicated . If two of the September 11 hijackers came from the UAE and money used to fund those attacks went through UAE banks , we have reason to believe that giving control of major ports to a UAE company is an added threat to security.There is no argument against the fact the UAE is located in a region of the world where anti-Western sentiment is strong . UAE control of these ports gives people a greater opportunity to act of these feelings.Sorry to say , but there is a difference between a British company operating these ports and a UAE company operating these ports . I am a strong supporter of President Bush on 95 % of the issues , but I do not know where his head is regarding this issue , if he really did know about this before the deal was made .",1

Fathers are allowed to take paternity leave so I do n't think you can get fired . But , I am not sure about that . You can check with your state 's labor dept . to confirm this . Your boss might not like the fact that you will need 4 days off for paternity leave especially since you are a relatively new employee . You will probably not get paid since you most likely have n't accrued sick or vacation time . You should give your boss as much advance notice as you can so he can plan accordingly . If you work for a company that has a Human Resources Dept . you might want to check with them to see how many days you can take ( it may be more than 4 ) and whether you have any sick time that would pay you while your out .

They have become orphans and are living destitute lives ... and even if they had the blessing of caring adults , most likely those adults need psychiatric help ( due to the huge growth in post-traumatic stress in the region ) and are destitute themselves .

Ambassador to the U.N. * Governor Mark Warner of VirginiaRepublicans : * Senator George Allen of Virginia * Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas * Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee , current Republican leader in the Senate * Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia * Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani * Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska * Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas * Senator John McCain of Arizona * Governor George Pataki of New York * Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts * Representative Tom Tancredo of ColoradoI would vote Kerry for the Democrats and McCain for the Republicans . Richardson and Hagel might be a good second choice .",1

"Is WAR a new kind of spectator sport , or do n't we as people GET IT ? ? ? War has always been a spectator sport . During the Civil War , crowds of people would ride out on a Sunday to watch the battle from a ridge in the distance . War correspondents have always reported on the progress of wars , with the news eagerly followed by proponents and opponenets of the war alike . The word `` marathon '' remembers a man who ran 26 miles back to Athens to report news of the Greek victory at Marathon , and then died.In most ways it is a good thing . War the the most serious government act , and as much should be known about the conduct of a war by the poeple as possible . Democracy is meaningless otherwise .",1
"Does the Patriot Act Really Work ? What 's your opinion ? I think it 's a fallacy in the idea that the Patriot Act , or any other law , can actually stop criminals . The Brady bunch of laws has n't stopped a criminal from buying guns . Terrorists will find a workaround , too . The Patriot Act does n't even act as a deterrent . Remember , The 9-11 terrorists only had boxcutters , and I 'll bet they did n't bother to read any laws . The Patriot Act makes suspects out of honest people , and violates the rights of innocent people , the people that laws are supposed to protect . The Patriot Act is a perversion of the law . The President and all the rest of these public servants who act more like they are our rulers took an oath to uphold the Constitution , not disregard it , and not pass whatever laws they want as if the Constitution did not exist . What they do sounds more like treason to me -- or at least a great reason to kick them out of their offices onto their smug asses . Remember : the purpose of the Constitution is to protect you from your government . It probably works to some degree . We 've managed to prevent some terrorist actions as a result of it ... although at the expense of diminishing the authority of the U.S. Constitution.I 'm a believer in slippery slopes so I imagine the logical end to all of this is to preempt every potentially illegal action by putting the entire population of the country into prison ... just to be on the safe side .",1

"Has the world gone mad , or is it just me ? Even a child will tell you no one blows their selves up because they do not want freedom ... Or am I hearing Pätrick Henry , `` Give me Liberty or give me death '' ! Dear Fox , I think I can understand what you mean but maybe their definition of freedom is a little defferent from American standard definition.Iraq specially is an ancient civilization , they have been there for the history ( As you know Babylon was there many years B.C . ) and they have many complicated feelings.Iraq is a holy land for Muslims , if you know Islam history you will understand that this is not a common place with common people , they have their own mythes and they love them . The most powerful Islamic schools are there and people believe in Islamic leaders . Even when they were called for vote they got permission for it from their religious leader . They have been guards of many holy shrines there even before crusade wars . you ca n't tell them how to think about freedom , it seems they find clergy government more free than democracy and they are fighting for freedom.This is very important for US because of Domino theory which US hope to happen in middle east and all other countries there see what a beauty is Democracy in Iraq and try to have one but it will not happen , I think the second US leave the Iraq they will overthrow their government and make a new Islamic-Clergy type .",1
"New estimates for the cost of the Iraq war are up to 2 trillion dollars . Is this too much , or not enough ? A study by Nobel Laureate Joseph E. Stiglitz and Harvard budget expert Linda Bilmes estimates the cost of the Iraq War at between $ 1-2 trillion ( the White house originally estimated costs of 100-200 billion . ) The study expands on budgetary estimates by including costs such as lifetime disability and health care for the over 16,000 injured . It also analyzes costs to the economy , including the economic value of lives lost and impact of factors such as higher oil prices that can be partly attributed to the conflict in Iraq . Is 2 trillion too much money to spend for the war against Iraq , or is it not enough ? it is to much money for a war that should of never been fought . i know that sadam housian is not a good person . but he did not bomb us . bin laden did . why arent we spending 2 trillion on a war with the guy who bombed us not with the guy that bushs daddy should have already gotten rid of . guess the apple dont fall far from the bush family tree .",1

"How should the nuclear standoff with Iran be resolved ? I do n't understand . US suggests they want to attack Israel .

Iran says they want nuclear power , to be a developed country . But it 's not necessary to have nuclear power to develop . Many European countries or the neighbour Arab Emirats , are more than developed wihtout nuclear power . A military strike would be the worse option . If they want to have nuclear power or even nukes , they should , like many other countries , even with dictators do . Only because they do n't have a good relationship with Israel or US , it should n't be banned . If in 10 years they dare to attack someone with nukes , they will be easily smashed back .

"What states have no law requiring breaks for workers ? What states , other than Virginia , have no law requiring employers to give rest or meal breaks in an eight-hour workday ? Few states require lunch or rest breaks , if any . I know that for most employees over the age of 18 in even more politically liberal states like New Jersey do not require rest breaks . Of course , many states regulate such for minors , but few for workers over the age of 18.I 've included a link to a Department of Labor chart that gives requirements for each state on meal breaks . It 's a pretty short list : California , Colorado , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Kentucky , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , Nebraska , Nevada , New Hampshire , New York , North Dakota , Oregon , Rhode Island , Tennessee , Washington , and West Virginia.For rest breaks , the list shrinks to California , Colorad , Kentucky , Minnesota , Nevada , Oregon , and Washington.Perhaps few regulate is because most employers voluntarily give rest breaks to employees to make work more bearable . Perhaps few regulate because unions , often providing the strongest labor law components in states , do n't really care if non-unionized labor is forced to receive breaks , but really works hard to ensure that its own members are protected through contract agreements and bargaining . Regardless , I hope this information helps .",1

I Wont say that the president is doing a bad job , because I dont understand the reasons why he does the things he does , and I hav'nt studied the issues he is dealing with , but I cant feel good about starting a war in Iraq , bombing Pakistan when we 're not at war with them , violating our civil rights , the temporary concentration camp in the superdome after katrina ... etc . But I worry about what people in other countries think about Americans when he speaks for us with that dumb redneck voice . He was not elected by the majority of Americans . We chose Al Gore . The supreme court appointed him president . In the 2004 election he did'nt win any primary elections . The repulicans did'nt let anyone challenge him . They made believe they were democrats and voted for Kerry , and the democrats were saddled with an unelectable candidate .

In the 2000 election Gore won the popular vote , i.e . the majority voted for gore . In other countries you win if the majority votes for you . The foreigners dont believe that story about how Bush won because he got more of something called an electoral vote , especially since it happened in a state run by his brother . The election in Florida was done by computer , and everyone knows that a really good hacker can get into a computer and make it malfunction , so you know when theres something fishy going on with a computer , a hacker has made it past the firewall .

Bush for the speach he gave on the Bird Flu problem . She wanted to know why he he was so concernec when only 70 people have died world wide . This shows either her ignorance of the issues or her willingness to ignore them to bash the President . Ann Coulter is hard line conservative that will criticize as well as praise the Pres and therefore is more honest . I vote Ann Coulter",1

"Does the government have the right to order private internet companies to provide user 's search records ? Lately both Yahoo and Google where served a court ordered to hand over to the government some search records regarding porn Some good answers here . I 'll take a stab at it myself , though I do n't know anything about the incidents other than what the original poster included in his question.First , we 're talking about illegal pornography . `` Regular '' porn , the kind that is n't illegal depending on whoever 's standards we 're using , is n't going to be subject to a search warrant because it is n't a crime ... and search warrants can only be issued when they seek to provide evidence of a public offense ( a crime ) . So whatever porn we 're talking about , it 's evidently illegal according to whatever legal standard is being used ( and this varies , but things like kiddy porn are illegal everywhere in the US ) . Once the illegality has been established , then I do n't think there 's much left to talk about ... you can not hide behind a right to privacy if you are engaging in criminal behavior . That 's not to say you give up your right to privacy , it 's to say that if you 're engaging in criminal acts , the government has the right to ask a judge for a search warrant to gather evidence of those acts , and I would argue that you can not complain about your privacy being `` invaded '' when they do.And a word about search warrants ; they are not rubber-stamped documents that sail through the justice system to your front door . Law enforcement agents must prepare an application for them , outlining reasons to believe a particular place holds evidence of a particular crime . They must swear the things they 've said in that document are true , and then they must present the document to a neutral party - a magistrate ( or a judge ) . That magistrate ( or judge ) then reviews the information provided by the agent , and decides on his/her own if there is a more than likely chance ( i.e. , `` probable cause '' ) that the things the agents are looking for are in the places the agents say they are . Despite the rare news to the contrary , magistrates and law enforcement alike take this process seriously.About the `` third party '' argument made by the original poster : again - if you 're engaging in criminal behavior , you can not expect to hide behind the right to privacy just because you 've given the evidence of your guilt to a third party . The government has the right under our system of law to gather evidence of your criminal behavior , no matter where you have left it.If you want to deliver evidence of your involvement in criminal acts to a third party , press on ... and you do so at your own risk , obviously . The original poster 's comment is well taken ; if your third party is going to comply with an order of a court to disclose certain information relative to criminal acts , then perhaps you need to find another third party - one who will become a criminal themselves if they fail to comply with a lawful court order.Yahoo and Google have not betrayed anyone 's trust ... although it 's been a while since I 've seen them , I 'm fairly certain both corporations have privacy policies , and I 'm equally certain both of them talk about safeguarding your information except when ordered to release it pursuant to a court order . If the third party thing bothers you , do n't use a third party ... there 's a saying : `` three can keep a secret , if two are dead . '' Do n't want anybody to know what you 're doing ? Do n't tell anybody .",1

So yes technically American Indians or more precisely the various tribes are the first people here and thus should be sovereign and even ruling the white man not vice versa as it is . They have more right to be called Americans than the rat tag bunch of colonials that arrived here and started a wave of slaughter and massacres such as the force eviction of tribes along the trail of tears , force evacuation and settlement of reservations , gifts of smallpox infested blankets in an effort in biological warfare , broken treaties and senseless wars and killings .

"Why is this Alito guy such big news ? I 've been reading about this Alito guy but I do n't understand why is such big news . From what I understand he 's being interviewed for Judge of the Supreme Court . Is there a piece of information I 've missed ? Why is that such big news ? It just seems like a regular political process . It is a regular political process . True , the parties are bickering as usual , but there has always been controversy surrounding new Supreme Court justices . If everyone 's political party was swiched ( Bush would become a Democrat , for example ) , the exact same ranker would be going on . Justices are the top echelon of the legal system , so they are very important . Also , they are appointed for life , so you had better make sure you 're picking the right guy . Unfortunately , Mr. Alito is being confirmed during a particularly nasty period of political polarization , so many of the questions and issues are n't real questions , they 're sensationalist propaganda from both sides of the isle . In case you missed the memo , abortion is NOT the only legal question of the day , yet that seems to be what most of the fuss is about . Lastly , since they are appointed for life , this man has the potential power to influence American jurisprudential thought for perhaps the next 30 or 40 years . Needless to say , he 'll be making rulings long after Bush is gone , and the next guy , and the next guy . He 'll also survive Republicans losing their majority in Congress , then gaining it , then losing it , etc . So essentially , theres a big fuss because they are getting ready to install someone who is going to effecting law ( and by extention politics ) for many years to come . I personally think the Court will be fine with Alito because , unlike the talking heads on CNN and FoxNews who seem fixated on abortion and other trivial matters , I 've been watching the hearings live and reading the transcripts ( I 'm a law student ) , and he actually seems less polarizingly conservative and more qualified than even Republicans are admitting to .",1

"Who can tell me about Frances Farmer ? she 's was from seattle i think Frances Elena Farmer ( September 19 , 1913 , Seattle , Washington – August 1 , 1970 , Indianapolis , Indiana ) was an American film actress.Early life , career and marriageFarmer was born and raised in Seattle , Washington . In 1931 , at age 17 , she entered and won $ 100 in a writing contest sponsored by Scholastic Magazine with her controversial essay God Dies . In 1935 , as a student at the University of Washington , she won a subscription contest for the leftist newspaper The Voice of Action . First prize was a trip to the Soviet Union , which she took despite her mother 's strong objections . These two incidents led to accusations that Farmer was both an atheist and a Communist . Farmer studied drama at the University of Washington . During the 1930s its drama department productions were considered citywide cultural events and attended accordingly . While there she starred in diverse plays including Helen of Troy , Everyman and Uncle Vanya . In 1935 she starred in the school 's production of Alien Corn , speaking foreign languages , playing the piano and receiving rave reviews in what was the longest running play in the department 's history at the time.1936Returning from the Soviet Union in the summer of 1935 Farmer stopped in New York City , hoping to launch a legitimate theater career . Instead , she was referred to Paramount talent scout Oscar Serlin who arranged for a screen test . Paramount offered her a 7-year contract . Farmer signed it in New York on her 22nd birthday ( September 19 , 1935 ) and moved to Hollywood . She had top billing in two well-received 1936 `` B '' films and that same year was cast opposite Bing Crosby in Rhythm On The Range . Also in 1936 she was loaned to Samuel Goldwyn to appear in Come and Get It , based on the novel by Edna Ferber . Her portrayals of both the mother and daughter were praised by the public and critics , some of whom wrote of her potential to become a major star . She also married her first husband , actor Leif Erickson , in 1936.A rebellious starFarmer was not entirely satisfied with her career , however . She felt stifled by Paramount 's tendency to cast her in films which depended on her looks more than her talent and her naturally outspoken demeanor made her seem uncooperative and contemptuous . In an age when the studios dictated every facet of a star 's life , Farmer rebelled against the studio 's control and although she allowed herself to be put through cosmetic `` makeovers '' and photographed in bathing suits for publicity purposes , she resisted every attempt they made to glamourize her private life , refusing to attend Hollywood parties or to date other stars for the gossip columns . At the time , she was sympathetically described as being indifferent about the clothing she wore and was said to drive an older-model `` green roadster , '' which according to a columnist , once broke down on Melrose Avenue , blocking traffic as Farmer pushed the stricken car to the side , much to the consternation of the studio 's publicity department.Hoping to enhance her reputation as a serious actress , she left Hollywood in 1937 to do summer stock on the East Coast . She had already attracted the attention of Harold Clurman and Clifford Odets and appeared in the Group Theatre production of Odets ' play Golden Boy in a performance which at first received highly mixed reviews ( Time magazine commented that she had been miscast ) . However by 1938 when the production had embarked on a national tour , regional critics from Washington D.C. to Chicago had given her rave reviews.Farmer also had an affair with Odets but he was married to actress Luise Rainer and did n't offer Farmer a commitment . Farmer felt betrayed when Odets suddenly ended the relationship , believing he had used her drawing power to further the success of his play . She returned to Hollywood , somewhat chastened , willing to continue her movie career but still on her terms . She arranged with Paramount to s",1

"What war was it when we were attacked by Japan at Pearl Harbor W W I or W W II ? it would help if you could also tell me the difference between the two World Wars besides one being the first and the other being the second . I ’ m getting too old , I can ’ t believe anyone would need to ask such a question.World War I , 1914–18 , also known as the Great War , conflict , chiefly in Europe , among most of the great Western powers . It was the largest war the world had yet seen.Causes World War I was immediately precipitated by the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist in 1914 . There were , however , many factors that had led toward war . Prominent causes were the imperialistic , territorial , and economic rivalries that had been intensifying from the late 19th cent. , particularly among Germany , France , Great Britain , Russia , and Austria-Hungary.Of equal importance was the rampant spirit of nationalism , especially unsettling in the empire of Austria-Hungary and perhaps also in France . Nationalism had brought the unification of Germany by blood and iron , and France , deprived of Alsace and Lorraine by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 , had been left with its own nationalistic cult seeking revenge against Germany . While French nationalists were hostile to Germany , which sought to maintain its gains by militarism and alliances , nationalism was creating violent tensions in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy ; there the large Slavic national groups had grown increasingly restive , and Serbia as well as Russia fanned Slavic hopes for freedom and Pan-Slavism.Imperialist rivalry had grown more intense with the new imperialism of the late 19th and early 20th cent . The great powers had come into conflict over spheres of influence in China and over territories in Africa , and the Eastern Question , created by the decline of the Ottoman Empire , had produced several disturbing controversies . Particularly unsettling was the policy of Germany . It embarked late but aggressively on colonial expansion under Emperor William II , came into conflict with France over Morocco , and seemed to threaten Great Britain by its rapid naval expansion.These issues , imperialist and nationalist , resulted in a hardening of alliance systems in the Triple Alliance and Triple Entente and in a general armaments race . Nonetheless , a false optimism regarding peace prevailed almost until the onset of the war , an optimism stimulated by the long period during which major wars had been avoided , by the close dynastic ties and cultural intercourse in Europe , and by the advance of industrialization and economic prosperity . Many Europeans counted on the deterrent of war 's destructiveness to preserve the peace.War 's Outbreak The Austrian annexation ( 1908 ) of Bosnia and Hercegovina created an international crisis , but war was avoided . The Balkan Wars ( 1912–13 ) remained localized but increased Austria 's concern for its territorial integrity , while the solidification of the Triple Alliance made Germany more yielding to the demands of Austria , now its one close ally . The assassination ( June 28 , 1914 ) of Archduke Francis Ferdinand at Sarajevo set in motion the diplomatic maneuvers that ended in war.The Austrian military party , headed by Count Berchtold , won over the government to a punitive policy toward Serbia . On July 23 , Serbia was given a nearly unacceptable ultimatum . With Russian support assured by Sergei Sazonov , Serbia accepted some of the terms but hedged on others and rejected those infringing upon its sovereignty . Austria-Hungary , supported by Germany , rejected the British proposal of Sir Edward Grey ( later Lord Grey of Fallodon ) and declared war ( July 28 ) on Serbia.Russian mobilization precipitated a German ultimatum ( July 31 ) that , when unanswered , was followed by a German declaration of war on Russia ( Aug. 1 ) . Convinced that France was about to attack its western frontier , Germany declared war ( Aug. 3 ) on France and sent troops against France through Belgium and Luxembourg . Germany had hoped for British neutrality , but German violation of Belgian neutrality gave the British government the pretext and popular support necessary fo",1

I personally would consider Eurpoe and Asia to be united before I would ever consider North and South America to be united . If you think otherwise ( or if you agree with me ) , please explain your answer . All 7 continents were joined together billions of years ago . However through time , they gradually split up , resulting in North and South America , and Australia to be separate from the main body-Europe , Asia and Africa.I figured because Europe and Asia had different coloured people which each had their unique tradition and customs . As they ruled differently due to customs , tradition and prctices , they probably decided to each govern their own way and thus they spilt up into 'different continents ' , though Europe and Asia are on the same piece of land .",1

If that is the case you can not be a part of the jury because you would not be impartial .",1

"Too much big brother ? I heard something about computers monitoring all phone calls of `` citizens '' for key words , all in the name of national security .

I could care less if a computer listened in but what if someone talked about the plot of a movie to a friend . What then ... the swat team shows up ? I think all this can go too far , how much freedom are you willing to loose to be safer ? From my understanding it goes through a computer and then kicks it over to humans to deseminate , plus it 's just international calls coming into the US that is being captured.The computer program that captured everything in the '90 's was called Eschelon started by the Clinton Adminstration , which by all estimations was a million times more invasive than the NSA capturing cell calls",1

"Does anyone Really believe that a `` terrorist '' would stand and fight in Iraq ? How could anyone think a Terrorist would face a U. S. A . Marine in Iraq. ? That makes no sense . Terrorist are cowards . They do the dirty work behind your back not face to face . The biggest problem in Nam that got our boys killed was not knowing friend from foe . Iraq is no different than Nam . Iraq is now in Cival War for Control of the oil money . Greed is at work . Yes , I do . Do n't forget that these terrorists are raised from birth to hate westerners in general and Americans in particular . They are shown videos of Americans dying from a very young age in the madrassas . They are conditioned to believe that if you die in jihad , it is an instant ticket to heaven.Now what I am going to say next may seem a bit offensive to Americans , but it is not meant to be . In order to beat the terrorists , we have to start understanding them ... we have to start thinking like them . To a terrorist , conducting warfare as they do is not cowardly . It is cowardly by western standards , but not by eastern standards . Terror has been a part of Asian warfare for thousands of years . And this is not the first time Americans have seen these tactics . The Viet Cong used them first against France and then against the United States to beat both countries . Suicide bombers , roadside bombs , combatants dresses as civilians ... talk to any Viet Nam combat vet and they will tell you.And do n't forget this , either : Back in the 1770s , our Founding Fathers were considered terrorists . They adapted a lot of tactics from the Indians which was unknown to European armies . We could not win in a face-to-face stand up fight , so we fought `` dirty '' - at least by the standards of the day .",1

"will social security be out business by 2010 ? Of course not . It would still be in fine shape if Congress had not utilized its funds for other purposes . Even then , and assuming a mediocre economy , it would pay a good percentage of the pension amounts for the next 50 years or so.I am afraid that the hype about its demise was fostered by an administration that wants to get rid of it and support a plan that will be enormously profitable for brokers and financial advisers , among others . And a plan that will be enormously expensive for us to implement , while at the same time removing the security that people have worked to obtain in their elderly years .",1

"Why do some states still have barbaric ways and have the death penilty and others do n't ? I notice that there is still legallized murder in some states and none in others . How can a civillized government allow this to happen in any states ? The short answer is that we live in a Democracy and death penalty laws are on the books because people ( or their representatives ) put them there . There are usually four distinct groups of people involved and it cuts across party lines . Large groups favor the death penalty and large groups oppose it for any number of good reasons . Small groups who have lost someone to murder believe that the death penalty is `` too good '' for the perpetrator , but are not allowed to take the law into their own hands . Small groups related to the murderer oppose the death penalty because of shame and the fact that they still love the perpetrator and find good excuses for him/her.On top of all that , sensational murders committed by those who expect to escape punishment spur on society to support the death penalty . Crimes against innocent children are particularly heinous . And news that someone convicted of murder has been proven ( by DNA tests ? ) to be innocent show the weaknesses in our judicial system.The question really is not all that simple . In New York state , the results of a close Governors race was likely determined on the death penalty issue . The winner favored the penalty while the incumbent never used it based on personal beliefs . Changing politics will always be involved . Many will always feel that a barbaric murderer should know that he/she might face a barbaric fate . And some feel that might save innocent lives .",1

They have said numerous time that if Taiwan declares itself independent from China then it would attack the country of Taiwan .

"I got my first speeding ticket after years of driving . I live in Layton Utah , What options do I have ? I was speeding in an industrial area . Clocked for 9 over the limit . I am trying to discover my options on how to settle this without points on my license . I 'm not disputing guilt , but I have a clean driving record which spans 35 years . Check with the city of Layton to see if they offer a traffic class . In lieu of going to court , most cities will off you a Plea In Abeyance . It 's essentially entering a guilty plea , paying a reduced fine , and agreeing to go to traffic class . You will have to pay for the traffic class seperately from the ticket amount . If you take the class then the points do n't appear on your license . If you do n't take the class , then you have to pay the full amount of the ticket and the points will be put on your license . It 's annoying to get a ticket but the class is n't too painful and it helps to brush up on your driving knowledge . Good luck and happy driving !",1

"how is the president of the united nations elected ? I think you 're referring to the position of UN Secretary General . There is no position as `` President of the U.N.

UN Secretaries-General usually serves two consecutive terms , but sometimes only one . The U.N. Secretary General is chosen in two steps : The Security Council nominates a candidate to the U.N. General Assembly , which must then approve the selection by majority vote . In practice , the power to select a new Secretary General rests with the Security Council , since the General Assembly has never rejected its nominee . A successful candidate must have the backing of nine of the Security Council 's 15 member states , including all five permanent members ( Britain , China , France , Russia , and the U.S. ) . As a result , the selection is subject to the veto of any of the five permanent members of the Security Council .

"what etiquette , respect and rules does one need to follow as a tourist in Dubai , united Arab Emirates ? Hi - I 've only been to the airport in Duabi , but here are some pointers I found : DressAlthough the UAE is very liberal in many respects , the correct dress code is important in order not to cause offence . Conservative clothes that cover the body and limbs are preferable to casual shorts and sleeveless tops for both sexes , especially in rural areas where tradition is important.Indeed , long , loose clothing can be much cooler and more comfortable than smaller items that expose the skin to the hot sun.The Arab national dress worn in Dubai is made especially to keep the wearer cool during the hottest of weather . Men wear the kandoura or dishdasha , a white , ankle-length garment which is a loose fit and very effective in the hot and cold.Women wear an abayah , which is a black , long-sleeved , full-length robe . Both men and women wear head coverings to protect their heads and faces from the sun and windblown sand.Traditional garments are also ideal for when the temperature drops sharply at night.PhotographyNormal tourist photography is acceptable , but it is considered offensive to photograph Muslim women . It is also courteous to request permission before photographing men . Always avoid taking photographs of anything even remotely military , such as buildings , perimeter fences , vehicle convoys , checkpoints , airports and so on.TippingTipping practices are similar to most parts of the world . Where no service charge is included , 10 % is adequate.BargainingBargaining is an expected part of buying in the souk and elsewhere . Traders will usually drop their prices , often quite substantially , particularly for cash sales , but it is important to be polite at all times and not feign anger or disgust.RamadanDuring this month of fasting , pious Muslims will not eat anything during daylight hours , with most conforming to the injunctions . Foreigners are not expected to follow suit , but it is considered impolite to smoke , drink or eat in public during Ramadan . In general , I 've heard that it 's a fantastic place to go for so many reasons ! I 'm envious - have a great time .",1

This is our hope , and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.With this faith , we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope . With this faith , we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood . With this faith , we will be able to work together , to pray together , to struggle together , to go to jail together , to stand up for freedom together , knowing that we will be free one day.And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God 's children will be able to sing with new meaning : My country 't is of thee , sweet land of liberty , of thee I sing . Land where my fathers died , land of the Pilgrim 's pride , From every mountainside , let freedom ring ! And if America is to be a great nation , this must become true . `` ... ... ... ... ..",1

"church and state who rules ? For almost 50 years an nonprofit agency has been located in a town building.This nonprofit was started by a church group and continues to be under the churches umbrella.Does a local government official have the right to governance over this nonprofit organization because it is in a town building ? first off , does the organization have a lease for the facilities ? If so you can check the lease to see if there is any violation of the terms of the lease.Regarding separation of church and state , I believe as long as the mission of the organization is nonsectarian , that is , providing assistance or service to those of all religions , then it is not violating church/state restriction . You could be a bit more specific about the activities and mission of the organization for a better answer .",1

"Where were you on the morning of 9/11 ? Do you remember exactly where and what you were doing ? I do . I stayed home from work because I was n't feeling good . I was watching reruns of ER on TNT and they broke in . I was mad at first but once I realized what had happened , I could n't get away from the TV or my computer . I was simultaneously watching TV and on the internet trying to figure out what the hell was going on . So , where were you ? It will always stay in my mind ... I was in a class at my company 's HQ in Baltimore . During our 10 AM coffee break one of the guys came in and said that a plane had hit the World Trade Center ... we thought he meant the WTC in downtown Baltimore ... we all went outside to look ... nothing wrong there . We all went next door to see the TV and realized it was in NYC ... by then the 2nd tower had been hit . Class was out for the day ... we were all glued to the TV ... everyone in the company was sent home early because Gov . Glendening was going to close the I-95 tunnel under Balto . Harbor.By the mid-afternoon there were F-16s flying combat air patrol over Baltimore.Our class got out that Friday ; all of us had to drive home - no flights available ; another guy and I had a rental car from the week before . I live in Oregon ; he lives in Arizona . We started driving - dropped him off with his brother-in-law in Detroit , then I drove all the way to Portland . One guy had to rent a U-Haul to drive home ; rental cars could n't be had for love or money.One of my cousins is a lawyer in NYC ... we like her in spite of it : ) ... she had an early morning meeting in the WTC , and got out of the north tower 1/2 hr . before the first plane hit ...",1

"President Kennedy a gread pres. ? Why specifically is President Kennedy remembered as such a great President ? What was his greatest achievement ? He was charismatic , but he was n't a great president.His unplanned remarks to Nikita Khruschev , President of the Soviet Union , caused Khruschev to judge Kennedy to be weak . Consequently , he installed nuclear missles in Cuba . Kennedy reacted by blockading Cuba . For several days in October 1963 , the world was on the brink of a nuclear war.Shortly after taking office , he allowed plans for an invasion of Cuba to proceed . The invasion by Cuban refugees from Miami was a debacle that was a violation of international law and a humiliation to the United States.He continued the program of sending military advisors to Viet Nam . After his death , this was continued by President Lyndon Johnson and expanded into the Viet Nam war . The Viet Nam war destroyed Johnson 's presidency.To his great credit , he was aggressive about furthering the Civil Rights movement by supporting activists with Federal authority in several high profile integration efforts.If he had lived , almost surely he would have been elected to a second term . He seemed to grow wiser while in office . Would that wisdom have led him to become a great president ? Would the US have become bogged down in an unwinnable war in Viet Nam ? Would his philandering have brought him down ? Interesting questions.Wikipedia knows all.I was 10 when he was elected and 13 when he was assassinated . I will never forget the optimism he brought to the country . We believed he could lead us into the bright future . I will never forget the terror of the Cuban Missle Crisis . I will never forget the devastation I felt when he was assassinated . The United States has not been the same since . John Kennedy was the last president who _lead_ us . Presidents after him have been followers without vision.In 1989 ( I was 39 ) , I went to President Kennedy 's grave in Arlington Cemetary . Probably 15 or 20 people were there . I was amazed that people were moved to silence , even those obviously born after his presidency . I felt a great deal of reverence and had tears in my eyes .",1
"Do illegal aliens inflict short-term or long-term damage on the US economy ? Humanitarian issues aside , what is the real danger in letting illegals flood across our borders ? Well.. really it all boils down to control ... and money.People do n't like not having control of who is in their country , and the government does n't like losing tax revenues on undocumented workers and their taking advantage of public services that the do n't help pay for . This can make some social services unavailable for citizens because of the strain it puts on the system.Some people argue that they steal valuable american jobs , but most of them are day laborers or farmworkers because they do n't have the paperwork to get a decent job . SOME americans do need these jobs ... but a lot of unemployed people are not looking for that kind of work.It is also hard to control a bunch of people that do n't know our language well ( some speak great ) , have different cultural values , and are not familiar with our laws.If they are caught and deported , it would seem like a short term problem , but there are always more coming , with no end in sight , so the problem itself is long term , even if the people are n't .",1

The person above is absolutely wrong . Property is property . He will own it as long as he is able to pay taxes and the mortgage . His business will remain his business as long as he can run it . He and only he will decide if he wants to sell his house or his business , the government ca n't take it away just because he is here illegally.But he could get in trouble with the IRS if he does n't pay taxes , but that has nothing to do with his immigration status whatsoever . It is not true that a person here illegally can not pay property and business taxes . The IRS has the same authority over any citizen or non-citizen that does not pay all the business taxes .

"War ? Why ? The real reason please . To force a way of life on the conqured ? Or for power and economic gain ? From the earliest history of humanity , war has always been about only two things - for power , and for resources , and many times it is for both - and many other times it is a war for power cloaked under a war for religion or resources . Hitler claimed he attacked poland for resources - he claimed he needed land for the German people , but that was really for his own power . Religious wars have been fought and are fought for power . For the power that those at the top of religion have over thier people . The best way to consolodate your power over your own people is to unify them against an enemy . That goes for political power as well as religious . The religious leaders of Europe fought the holy wars for thier own gains , claiming it was religious duty , however those at the top weilded the power over thier people by sending them to war . The warriors fought for god and religion , but those in power facilitated this . War will never go away because there will never be equity - someone will always have what someone else has . If by some miracle of technology , anyone can have anything , there will still be wars for power - power is the one thing that ca n't be fabricated . If you look at the current muslim extremists , they are not fighting for thier gods , they are fighting for power , and indirectly for resources . They want to create a muslim world , where they will have the power , and by having the power , they will get the resources . If you look at the heart of any conflict , you 'll see it - resources and power . Those are the core reasons for ANY war . However , since it takes two to make war . The Allies could n't stand aside while Hitler took over Europe and killed millions - wars are started by those who want resources and power , but are ended by people who fight for the defense of themselves and others . Wars are rarely started for honorable reasons , but they are often ended by honorable people , who sacrifice themselves to stop the greedy , the evil , and the powerhungry . However , sometimes , those who fight the evil and powerhungry have dishonorable motives of thier own , but they can claim the moral highground because they did n't start the war , and they will benefit from defeating the ones who started it , and maybe because they destroyed a greater evil , it is accepted . Sometimes you have to trade a great evil for a lesser evil.This also goes for society on the small scale as well - Christians claim homosexuals are evil sinners in order to strengthen thier own group - any group gets stronger with a common enemy . There is no better way to facilitate group cohesion , and this group cohesion in this case leads to even more power for those at the top . Life is a power struggle .",1

"was the 11th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , UN-Constitutionally adopted ? Was the Amendment UN-Constitutional because it was not in Pursuance of the Original Constitution ?

"In politics what does The Right & The Left mean ( what connection to Democrats/Republicans ) ? The left and right ends of the political spectrum discribe people 's basic philosopy of government . Most people think of Democrats of being left center and liberals comfortably in the left and Socialists at the extreme left . On the right side , Republicans would be near the center , Conservatives comfortable in the right and libetarians at the far right.The right tends to favor policies in which the role of the government is extremely limited , especially when it comes to promoting the general welfare of the populous , but at the same time spending adequate resouces for the common defense of the nation such as the military and the enforcement of international trade agreements . Some issues that the Right traditionally cares about are : * Minimize Taxes* Minimize Social Welfare Programs ( Social Security , Medicaid , Medicare ) * Minimize Regulations on Business and Individuals* Elimination of Wealth Redistribution policies such as Progressive Taxation , Asset Based Taxation , and Taxation on Income gained through investment or inheritance . * Minimize ability of citizens to sue the government or corporations , or other individuals based on laws designed to protect the environment , consumers , workers , women , minorities , etc ... .Recently , the Right has embraced other non traditional issues such as : * Increased government regulation of Abortion* Increased government regulation of End of Life decisions* Increased government regulation of Drug Usage* Increased Government funding of Christian religious groups , symbols and priorities . * Increased Government regulation of sexual pratices , indecent speech , homosexuality and unpatriotic behavior . * Decreased regulation of weapon ownership . * Support for public execution of certain criminals . * Reduction of constitutional gaurantees for accused criminals ( Victims Rights ) The left tends to favor a stronger government with policies which benefit the general population at the expense of those in positions of power . People on the left tend to believe that the government 's primary function is to provide for the general welfare of its citizens paid for by taxing the populous . Some issues that the left traditionally cares about are : * Generous funding of Social Programs ( Social Security , Medicaid , Medicare ) * A progressive tax system which taxes wealthy individuals at a higher rate and taxes income earned by means other than work ( Profits , Investment , Inheritence ) higher than work income . * Increased government regulation of employers , polluters , manufacturers , and individuals in the interests of protecting the populous* Protecting Certain Freedoms such as freedom of speech , freedom of the press , right to privacy , voting rights , rights of the accused , etc ... .Recently , the Left has embraced other non traditional issues such as : * Legalization of Abortion* Affirmative Action* Increased regulation of weapon Ownership* Less strict Immigration laws* Opposition of certain wars* Separation of Church and State",1

"Why is an abortion so easy to get ? Although I think abortion should remain legal , I think it should be harder to get one . All you need is $ 500 . Some girls use it as their only form of birth control . There are many states in which a girl under 18 does n't even have to have her parents permission . [ You ca n't even get your EARS peirced without parental consent . ] Maybe there should be mandatory counseling before and after . Before to go throught he options in handling an unwanted pregnancy ( adoption and so forth ) . And then after to deal with emotional effects of the abortion . What do you think ? if it was hard , women and girls would go to underground clinics , secret places or somewhere where they can get one . its the law of supply and demand . plus the medical consequenses of a backroom abortion could be devastating . at least clinical is safe . who knows what could happen in an uncertified environment . also , clinical provides JOBS , AND THEY MAKE A TON OF MONEY . just like cigarettes or alcohol , if they know they can kill you why is it legal , simple -- MONEY AND JOBS . lobbyists for these groups donate to politicians to get legislation in their favor . money talks . if abortion was illegal all the clinics , doctors , nurses , support staff would be unemployed and have to find another job , not good for the economy . thats why they do n't shut down big business , tobacco farmers would be devastated and the grain farmers , distillers , and distributors would have no job . it all about money , politics and keeping your job and the government getting the TAX DOLLARS generated from these enterprises . its sad but thats the system governments use to generate revenue",1

Lots of famous Israel leaders born and grew up in Iran , want a sample ? Netaniaho3 . Jews live freely in Iran , no one do any harm to them , they are accepted as a god based religion and they are free to do they rituals and business , even send money to Israel if they want to , they can leave Iran and go Israel but they don't4 . Iran and Israel have n't done anything against each other , maybe cursing is the worst act5 . Although everyone think Iranian is Arabs Iranian are not arabs and they almost hate them specially because of what they have done when conquered Iran , so Iran and Israel have a common enemy6 . Israel have done anti Iraq operations many times , Iraq was Iran enemy ( they were in war for years ) 7 . Iran Nuclear program was at progress for years , Israel could do an operation when Iran was really weak ( After Iran-Iraq war exactly at the time they attack Iraq ) Maybe they yell at each others but they totally love each other ; ) Many hidden strings in Iraq and Middle east are in Iran hands , although Neo Conservatism theories which are at progress specially by UK urges that Israel needs peace and UK is the leader of Middle east politics from old times.So decide yourself , these are the facts that I know .",1

"why was u.s.s.r.'seconomy having proplems under communism ? I lived in Moscow in 1992 for five months ... one of the vestiges of the communist system was the local food-staple ( milk , sugar , eggs and four ) market . Part of the system was to create jobs for all-To buy anything from this market you had to stand in an hour-long line to get a ticket that represented an item like a bag of flour , then you had to stand in an hour-long line to pay for what the tickets represented , then you had to go into another hour-long line to pick up the items you paid for , and finally you had to wait in an hour-long line for them to check your purchases against the reciepts and tickets . Four hours to buy milk and eggs- assuming you know exactly what you want.In a word , the economy was suffering from gross `` inefficiency '' that made profitability impossible . The inefficiencies came from govt . corruption and the notion that everyone should have a job ( even if the work is meaningless like it was in the market ) . Because it almost always cost more to produce than the benefit of production , the govt . borrowed heavily to support it 's programs ( which included almost all business because the govt . `` nationalized '' meaning they owned almost all of them ) leading to massive inflation and the eventual implosion of its economy .",1

Usual protocol is for the examiner to ask what medications the subject has taken . If the examiner does not ask , volunteer the information . The test itself takes readings of blood pressure , respiration , etc. , which may be affected by the medication , and therefore throw off the results.The real question is what the mental disorder is , and whether it would affect the ability of the subject to tell truth from fiction . The polygraph is designed to show when the subject is stating something the subject knows is untrue . If the subject `` knows '' men from Mars are controlling his thoughts , he will show as truthful when asked if he knows whether there is life on Mars .",1

This could be technology which would help enemies ( so-called ; expanding who constitutes an 'enemy ' greatly expands what can be kept secret ) , anything that would ruin our economy or the main corporations which support it , anything that might reveal how our weapons work , policies about how things are REALLY kept secret , plans for keeping the government ( and friends ) safe after a major attack , strategic sources of materials which are n't publicly disclosed already , scientific data that might cause panic , scientific data that might cause distrust of the government , inventions which could be used as weapons ( yes , they monitor patent applications ) , and all the usual things like who is a spy for who , how we monitor communications , how other countries monitor our communications ( and sell us the info ) , how much money our intelligence agencies spend , and who in our country is suspected of being a threat to any of the above things.I think that pretty much covers it . If anything like paranormal activity , UFO 's , or antigravity technology falls under the categories above , welllllll ... .And do n't forget that they wo n't tell you if something they tell you is really false or misleading so that you do n't investigate something else they are hiding . The interconnected web of confidentiality agreements , classified documents , and disinformation is not an accidentaly complicated system . It is meant to confuse people . Just like the aisles in a store which make you go around things just so you spend more time looking at and buying things you otherwise were n't interested in . It 's all in the marketing .",1

"any lawers in here ? My husband had lukemia when he was little . His father worked at a papermill . I have done research on the papermill and they do have benzene products . I know that it is possible for benzene to cling to clothing and induce lukemia . The problem is his lukemia has been gone for 20+ years and the statute of limitations apply . He has not been in for a check up nor has he ask a health professional if this could be possible . If he gets documentation stateing that it was indeed possible that the exposure may have caused his lukemia , could we sue for `` delayed discovery ? '' Sometimes the accrual of a cause of action in tort is delayed until the plaintiff discovered ( or reasonably should have discovered or suspected ) the factual basis for his or her claim . The discovery rule most frequently applies when it is particularly difficult for the plaintiff to observe or understand the breach of duty , or when the injury itself ( or its cause ) is hidden or beyond what the ordinary person could be expected to understand.Unfortunately , you did not specify where you live . Statutes and case law vary by , so there may literally be 50 different ways to answer your question . There might even be federal laws that apply .

"Why is it that RICH Americans walk free from a trial but POOR ones go to jail or to Death Row ? Actually , the percentage of celebraties that walk is about the same as the percentage of 'poor ' people who walk . Conviction rates at trial used to be over 90 % , the rates have been falling and in some major metropolitan areas are down in the 65 % - 70 % range . The big differences are ( 1 ) the big celeb trials make the papers and ( 2 ) 80 to 90 % of the 'poor ' plea guilty to something and do not go to trial.The two big celeb trials , OJ and Blakely are especially unique in that the juries were stupid , stupid , stupid . And in the OJ case , at least , the DAs were incredibly inept . Of course , it was not the jurors fault that they were stupid . They were picked because each one claimed to have no opinion , which meant they had no connection to current events . In the OJ case they also had to be locked up in a hotel for the duration , which meant that the jurors had either no jobs or dead end jobs and no family or social life . Further , with the massive publicity and cameras all around , the jurors got the idea that they were really in a TV show , such as Law & Order or CSI , where the obvious suspect is never the real criminal and all loose ends are tied up before the credits roll . A real trial , like real life ends up with loose ends , and 99 % of the time the obvious suspect did do it .",1

what is vior dire ? may have have some examples of potential questions to ask a prospective juror ? It 's `` voir dire '' . The phrase `` voir dire '' derives from Middle French ; in modern English it is interpreted to mean `` speak the truth '' and generally refers to the process by which prospective jurors are questioned about their backgrounds and potential biases before being invited to sit on a jury.Sample Questions to be asked to prospective jurors:1 . Do you have an opinion concerning the alleged facts in the case ? 2.Are you related to anyone involved with this case ? 3.Have media accounts of this case caused you to form an opinion about the defendant ? 4 . Have you ever served on a jury before in a criminal case ? 5 . Do you believe our system of justice is fair ? 6 . Do you understand that the prosecution must show `` beyond a reasonable doubt '' that the defendant is guilty as charged ? 7 . Will it be hard for you to disregard evidence the judge rules as inadmissible after you 've heard it in open court ? 8 . Do you believe that the defendant is innocent until proven guilty in this court ? 9 . Is there any reason you ca n't sit as an impartial juror in this case ?,1

"can the government really do illegal actions ? for instence ... can the gov . really lie to the public about different things like terrist acts and catasraphies . iv heard theorise that 9/11 didnt happen by commersial airplains and by types of gov . airplanes and that the CIA kidnapes terrorists and takes them to different countries where they have no laws and torchers them and things like that ? dont worry . this information is from reliable sourses which is why i wounder about this . Of course , various individuals within the American government , as well as larger entities within the government have gotten away with crimes . Check out the story of Ruby Ridge . Sara Weaver war murdered by FBI agent Leon Horiuchi 's sniper fire , as she stood on the doorstep with baby in her arms . The FBI also murdered one of her sons and killed the family dog . The government had to pay Randy Weaver 1.5 million dollars for this fiasco , but the government murderer Leon Horiuchi could never be prosecuted . Similar events happened at the government massacre of innocent civilians at the Branch Davidian church at Waco , Texas . Attorney General Janet Reno and ultimately Bill Clinton , were responsible for those murders , but they and all under them were never prosecuted . Our founders knew that government was a beast which would always grow in power and corruption and tyranny , unless seriously counterpoised by an armed and freedom loving people . Thomas Jefferson said the tree of liberty must be watered from time to time by the blood of patriots and the blood of tyrants . Our second amendment rights and inalienable God given rights to keep and bear arms , has been continually eroded by unconstitutional antigun laws . The people have been brainwashed by the government propaganda centers ( public schools ) that the government is our saviour , and that our rights come from the government , not from God , as the Declaration of Independence so clearly stated . Check out JPFO ( Jews for the Preservation of Firearm Ownership , Aaron Zelman 's group ) , which is the strongest gun rights group . The NRA is nothing but compromising antigun hypocrites.Alex Jones and some others believe that 911 was a conspiracy by the illuminati . Hard to tell . But certainly , if passengers on board those airlines had been able to exercise their constitutional right to keep and bear arms , such a thing could n't have happened . I will not fly if I ca n't take my gun . I will not be subjected to unconstitutional searches getting on the plane like some slave dog . I am a free american . The Patriot Act and similar legislation shows that the government is far more interested in using 911 and similar incidents to attack our rights , rather than to go after the enemy .",1

"What are the problems the No Child Left Behind Act has presented ? The biggest problem is that it makes teachers focus on teaching to a test rather than just teaching . Knowing how to take the test is more important , under this system , than knowing what is on it . Further , the act has been severely underfunded . The act requires more qualified teachers ( aka ones with more education ) , but more education means higher pay , which is something many school districts ca n't do.I think more importantly than any of those problems , there 's the issue of how to measure improvement . Under the act each class is compared to the previous class , meaning this year 's 2nd grade is compared to last year 's 2nd grade . Now , obviously comparing different groups of kids is fundamentally unfair . People do n't like to admit it , but some people have different base levels of intelligence . Certainly everyone who is not developmentally challenged should be able to pass high school reasonably , but to fault a school and its teachers simply because one class is , on average , not quite as smart is the most asinine thing I can think of . Thankfully the DOE is starting a pilot program of comparing student scores across their school careers ( comparing last year 's 2nd grade scores to this year 's 3rd grade scores ) . That is obviously the better way to do it , but making the switch is going to cost money , something the act has failed to provide .",1

"how do i find out what my citizenship is if i 'm an immigrant that was born in a refugee camp ? It depends on the immigration law of the country in which you were born . In the United States , citizenship is determined by two legal concepts , jus sangre and jus solis . The first is based on your parentage , the second on location . If you were born on US soil ( definitions of this can be complex , but it certainly includes all US States , Puerto Rico , etc ) , you acquired US citizenship at the time of birth under jus solis . you can check the source below for more information . If you are abroad , you can contact the local Embassy of Consulate of the nation you are interested in for information . Otherwise , you would normally refer to the local office of your country 's agency for handling citizenship , usually the Ministry of Internal Affairs , Home Ministry or Foreign Ministry.If you were born to at least one parent who was a US citizen at the time of your birth , you may be a US citzen under jus sangre . To determine this , check the source I list below . Your parent will have had to meet certain residency requirements and determination can only be made by factors such as your birthdate , which of parents is a citizen , and how long they may have resided in the US.Disclaimer : taking advice from a person using Bubba as a screen name could be hazardous for your health .

"Why does n't any one care about Africa ? First of all , I do n't think that 's a fair assessment . There are plenty of people who do in fact care very much about Africa and its people . UNICEF , Doctors Without Borders , CARE , and just about every AIDS group you can think of is involved over in Africa quite a lot.If you mean `` Why is n't Africa a higher priority for most of the world 's goverments ? '' then I think you are hitting nearer the mark . I 'm no expert on Africa , but I think there 's a couple of reasons why it does n't peg a bit higher on the attention-o-meter insofar as the US is concerned . Hitherto , Africa has n't had a whole lot to offer us . Sounds harsh , I know , but it 's the truth . We are forced to deal with the Middle East because they are a big energy source , but if the oil was n't there we would n't be either . African oil is starting to become a market player now too , so some of our attention may be shifting towards that region.The other main reason is the perception that Africa is a continent filled with people who simply can not get their collective sh*t together . It 's brimming with petty dictatorships , bloody coups , transient goverments , unending civil wars and ethnic violence . In the international arena there just is n't anyone reliable to deal with on a nation-to-nation level . Our news stories have left me at least with the view that Africa is a limitless sinkhole into which all the world 's largesse could be poured without doing much more than fattening up a corrupt few at the top and financing more armies to fight in the wars and/or commit the heinous genocides we read about all too often.Do the African people suffer ? Of course they do ! Most of those organizations I listed at the top are all about addressing the suffering on the individual 's level . But until Africa starts to produce more responsible goverments , not too much will ever be done geopolitically to help them .",1

"Do they really have govt . grants anyone can get ? It is hard to find grants to start a business . Unlike the myths that some perpetuate , federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business . And yes , grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it , that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.Nonetheless , you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance ( CFDA ) http : //www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http : //www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants . Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.Even if you buy books on `` how to get grants '' or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has , albeit packaged differently . But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.Even SBA does NOT give out grants . From the SBA website http : //www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html '' The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses , although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs . ( See http : //www.sba.gov/financing for more information ) While SBA does offer some grant programs , these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management , technical , or financial assistance .

"Do you feel that 2 years in the military should be a prerequisite for US citizenship ? My observations have been that the Latino and Black populations comprise most of the minorities in the military . I see this daily at a major US airport . I am not for war but at the same time I feel that , if immigrants want the freedoms which America provides , they should be willing to fight for them . This is a very good question.I do not think it should be required for citizenship , but I do think it could be tied into certain `` benefits '' . I firmly believe that true service would help most people , lower unemployment ( military training translates to outside employment ) , and lessen the `` gim me , gim me , gim me a handout '' crap that is very widespread . Why should people be given welfare when they are able bodied enough to serve in the military ? Why should people squeeze money from the Fed for schooling , when they can earn that benefit by serving in the armed forces ?",1

"What do you think about Twin Towers Event ? Was it done by USA ? The `` event ? '' Fairs are EVENTS . This was the destruction of lives in front of our eyes , on TV and in the streets . This was not an EVENT . This was wanton killing , preplanned devastation of lives , property , and the feelings of security that we had living in this secluded continent . To ask if it was done by the USA is like asking do you think God tricked Adam and Eve in the garden ? Criminy , do you check your lunch to see if your mom put poison in it ? No , it was n't done by the USA . I am saddened that someone would think this is the case . And concerned that something so tragic and REAL is termed an EVENT .

"What constitutes Quasi-public property ? Even thought the food court in the local Mall is Public property ; management will not allow me to circulate a Nomination Petition .

I 'm not exactually sure what Quasi-Public property is [ perhaps it falls under the `` squatter '' rules and regulations in NYC- where if a building is abandoned it then be reclaimed by new owners ] but the Parking lot of Walmart is probablly owned by the company as it most likely rents the buildings that the other buisnesses reside in- and thus the parking lot is walmarts just as if an apartment building had a pool , it would belong to the owner of the apartment building .",1

"Are you really offended by swearing ? Do you think profanity is stupid ? I do , I think it is the most superstitious bullshit ever . “ Oh noes , I have said a ‘ bad ’ word , someone is automatically offended ! ” Ridiculous . Anyway , what are your opinions on swearing ? Is it really that bad ? Does it really make people feel uncomfortable or is it just another word in the dictionary ? Is it limiting our rights to freedom of speech to not be able to swear on the radio or in settings like schools ? I personally dont get offended by them because they were always my second language . I do however think they can make a person sound extremely unintelligent when they use them simply for shock value . I think that as we mature though , it does seem to make you cringe when people curse with every other word out of their mouth . I can have a pretty dirty mouth when I get angry , or when I smash my thumb with a hammer or something- but in everyday conversation , whats the point ? Is it to sound `` cool ? '' I remember I used to do it for that reason when I was like 8 , but when the thrill wore off- it just seemed like those words really didnt have any real purpose for being in my sentances , but I didnt get offended by them- more like turned off I guess.If I meet someone and we are just having a conversation , and profanity takes up most of their conversation , I just think they are ignorant for the most part . I am used to it though , so sometimes the profanity seems more natural in certain situations.Taking Gods name in vain though , I think that is absolutely offensive because it is against the religious beliefs of many , whether you understand it or not- it does offend a lot of people.by the way , tranced- you didnt offend me either , you just gave me a bad impression of you . Your comments are ignorant because the truth is , if everyone believed in Jesus there wouldnt be any arguments , so the world wouldnt be so messed up . Like it or not its true , because if everyone believed in something moral - no matter what it is- we would all agree on that morality . So , to show you the ignorance in your statement- it is ridiculous to blame Christians for the worlds troubles when the worlds troubles are rooted in things that go AGAINST Christian belief ! Sometimes a little reason- goes a long way , no matter what your beliefs are .",1

"Is any government policy for the poor people really benifits them or bring any change in their livlihood ? You have to remember that government programs to help the poor are really just applying a financial band-aid to the problem .

"Receiving child support from someone on public assistance ? My husband has custody of his daughter and his daughter 's mother ( who does not see her anymore -- it 's been almost 10 months now ) is on public assistance and disability ( because of having bi-polar disorder , I guess ) . He wants to file for support because when HE did not have custody he paid his support faithfully . And he feels she needs to support her kid too . But he is curious if he will GET any support . I was told they would just subtract the support amount from the assistance amount and send the custodial parent the difference . But it would be nice to see if anyone else has had this experience before he files and takes time off work to do it . As long as there is not a medical condition preventing her from working she will be required to pay child support . The child support can be deducted out of her pay check . The amount of her assistance wo n't change . Even if she is on assistance the law requires that she supports her daughter the same way that her dad did .",1

"how can end premature ejaculation ? i used to practise masturbation since I was 15 and spoilt my sexual functioning to result to premature ejaculation.Nowadays I cant enjoy sex with women because I finish the round so Easy ! I am now 23 having quit masturbation just October 2005 . The praecox ejaculation just is a PSYCHOLOGICAL problem . Besides , with that term is specified any ejaculation that occurs involuntarily during the sexual act and BEFORE the penetration can occur even . Any short time concerning the duration of the sexual act mustn ’ t confused with the premature ejaculation . In fact , medically the penetration and the ejaculation inside the vagina exclude the problem . Some drug could be taken , but ONLY with the consent of the doctor while for you problem there are some different method to use . It ’ s not the right place here to prolong and if you just has too shame to talk with the doctor I ’ ll advice you to buy some specific book.I guess that your request is connected with your partner satisfaction.In fact , the most part of women need longer times for reaching orgasm than men.You know that the average time is within 15-30 min. , but it gets no sense if our partner needs a different time . Therefore , we must compare our time ( short or long ) with our partner ’ s one ! I only can give you some advices now.Try to begin the full act ( penetration ) as late as possible using in the meanwhile other methods ( you know ) to excite your partner . While “ acting ” try to think about different stuffs , just to distract your mind . Somebody stops the act a bit before the apex , just to avoid the forthcoming ejaculation or stop frequently the penetration during the act ( continuing to excite the partner anyway ) .Then , if you are able to have two acts consecutively , the most will already be done !",0

"if twin brothers and sisters get married and have babies ... .do their babies come out looking alike ? No . If , however , you had a set of twins : ( 1 ) Sisters 1 and 2 who are idential twins ( 2 ) Brothers 1 and 2 who are identical twins ( 3 ) Sister 1 marries Brother 1 ( 4 ) Sister 2 marries Brother 2Then : their offspring would be equally well-related to each other . That is to say , each child from either couple would be equally well-related to their brothers and sisters as they were to their cousins.There would be only standard risks of problems with the children and this would NOT have any problems associated with incest that other users appear to believe it would .",0

"Wht are the reqs for becoming a licensed psychiatrist in Florida ? Do you need a PhD or do you just need certification ? I 've just started looking into this as a career option & am sort of lost as to what to do or where to go for some complete answers . My intent , if at all possible , is to attend an online college , such as Capella . Thanks for the help ! In order to be a psychiatrist you need to attend an tradtional college/university and earn a BA or BS . Then you need to make sure that you have the required prerequisite classes for medical school which is inorganic chemistry I and II , organic chemistry I and II , physics I and II , biology I and II , 6-9 gredit hours of english/ english lit.. And some schools require that an applicant has calculus and 3-9 hours of behavioral sciences . And do n't forget to take the MCAT , have good recommendations , maybe volunteer at a hospital etc.. Then apply to medical school in which you will earn either a MD or DO depending on what program you want to be in . ( A psychiatrist has earned either an MD or DO . ) After you graduate from medical school , you need to enter a psychiatry residency ( I do n't know how long the residency program lasts , maybe 2-3 years ? ) . But , if you want to be a psychologist , you still need a BA or BS and then go to gradtuate school for psychology and earn a PhD . Be careful not to confuse a psychiatrist with a psychologist . A psychiatrist is a medical doctor ( M.D . or D.O . ) who writes out prescriptions and decides whether physical and mental disorders are from physical or psychological origins . A psychologist , however , is a doctor of philosophy ( Ph.D ) or a doctor of psychology ( Psy.D ) . Those are not medical degrees , and a psychologist can not prescribe medicine . But in order to become either one , you need to earn a B.A or B.S . first and have very good grades .",0

"how does one learn to swim well ? I can manage to go swim about 20 mtrs but i am exhausted and cant go any further . Can someone point me to good online swimming lessons and techniques for amateurs . If you are trying to swim freestyle ( crawl ) , switch to an easier stroke , like the sidestroke while you increase your endurance . If you can only swim 20m , then swim 20m , rest , and swim 20m again . Repeat that process . You can time your rests and shorten your rests as you get stronger and increase the number of repititions you do each session . After a while , push yourself to do 40m between stops , then 60 , etc.In my experience , if you can work up to 400m without stopping , you will be past the point where you are struggling in the water.It might be a good idea to have someone look at your stroke and tell you what needs correcting . If you are struggling to make 20m . there are probably a lot of things that you can do to make your stroke more efficient . Find out what they are and work on correcting one thing at a time . Find someone who 's swimming laps when you are at pool , someone who 's stroke looks good , and ask them to look at your stroke . Ask them what the worst thing that you are doing and what they think you should do about it . You 'd be suprised how many people would be happy to help you .",0

"Do you feel that ignorance about science reflects badly on religious people ? As a scientist , I have been quite taken aback by what seem like illogical uninformed statements , sometimes very strongly worded , by those in the religious community ( particularly Christian fundamentalists ) . Statements like:1. evolution depends on carbon dating2 . the big bang is part of evolution3 . if you accept the big bang you are an atheist/offensive to God/damned/etc4 . if you accept evolution you are an atheist/doing the work of the devil/damned/etc5 . illogical , intellectually dishonest definitions of the word `` theory '' in the context of `` scientific theory '' 6. irrational , intellectually dishonest definitions of what is `` scientific '' or what `` religion '' is.Frankly , making statements like this , and wandering into the scientific realm speaking nonsense really reflects badly on the religious community . It would be as if prominent scientists went and started to dictate to religious groups about what they could and could not do , or how they could worship . I feel that ignorance of any sort reflects badly on anyone . I think the problem many religious people have is that they feel science and religion are mutually exclusive , and that the sole purpose of science is to debunk religion . I 'm of another school of thought , that science and faith can coexist quite nicely . I 'm in good company , too : Johann Kepler , one of the greatest astronomers who ever lived : `` “ I thank Thee , my Creator and Lord , that Thou hast given me this joy in Thy creation , this delight in the works of Thy hands ; I have shown the excellency of Thy works unto man , so far as my mind was able to comprehend Thine infinity ” '' Blaise Pascal , mathematician and philosopher , discoverer of what is now called Pascal 's Law : `` ..the only perfect knowledge [ comes ] through Christian revelation '' Sir Isaac Newton : `` This most beautiful system of the sun , planets , and comets , could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being '' Louis Pasteur : `` ..spontaneous generation ( like materialism in general ) threaten [ s ] the very concept of God the Creator '' Wernher von Braun , one of the world ’ s foremost rocket engineers : `` It is as difficult for me to understand a scientist who does not acknowledge the presence of a superior rationality behind the existence of the universe as it is to comprehend a theologian who would deny the advance of science . Far from being independent or opposing forces , science and religion are sisters ... .There is certainly no scientific reason why God can not retain the same position in our modern world that He held before we began probing His creation with the telescope and cyclotron ” 'nuff said . : - )",0

I was wondering if boys tend to gravitate to their moms , while girls gravitate to their dads . I think parents tend to have a natural protection type sheild over the opposite sex offspring . Like a daddy and his little girl , there is nobody who can come in between them until sweet sixteen when daddy 's cleaning the shotgun , while mothers want their sons to turn out to be men of honor that women will want while he still has respect . I feel children will gravitate towards the nicer parents because their minds are so simple they respond to the parent who is nicer . If you left a jar full of sugar in front of a 4 year old it would be gone in a matter of minutes because they do n't know any reason why they should n't eat it all . When a parent scolds a child the child is instantaneously resentful because they have no idea of the long term effects , does that make sence ? ?",0
"Of two biblical ends noted : `` all perish '' or `` none perish '' , which is `` the end '' ? How does one get there alive ? Perhaps do the end `` run '' , from Hebrews 12:1 to 13:25 , along `` with patience '' , notably via a `` weight '' loss first ? What spiritual `` weight '' doth so easily beset many ? Who is `` patience '' , also notably doing the end run ? What 's the `` short work '' mentioned in the Holy Bible ? Is it perhaps hit 'skip it ' button for Rev 14-21 wrath ? Is Revelation of John a `` worse '' case scenario to a void ? the spiritual weight that besets us is sin.Patience is perseverance . There should be footnotes at the bottom of the pages of your Bible . They help explain some of the verses . Ask God for wisdom before you start reading .",0
"how dies gravity really work ? Just to expand on the answer by `` twertyto '' , the answer to your question is `` We do n't know yet '' . This is one of the major questions in physics right now . There are some ideas but none of them have been proven either mathematically or in laboratory experiment . It is believed by most leading minds in physics that once we learn the exact relationship between gravity and the other known forces ( electromagnetic , strong nuclear and weak nuclear ) , we will then understand how gravity works . To understand this relationship will take what is called the `` grand unified theory '' , which is not yet a theory at all but a hoped-for theory to be developed in the near future . The `` grand unified theory '' would explain how gravity is related to mass and energy and the `` known forces '' mentioned above , and would do for gravity what Einstein 's `` E=MC2 '' ( relativity ) did for understanding the relationship between mass and energy . ( Some quick background : E=MC2 explained the exact relationship between mass and energy , showing they are both different aspects of the same thing , and can therefore be converted into each other ) . To sum this up in a simple fashion : scientists believe that gravity , energy , mass and even time are all made of the same `` stuff '' at some super-fundamental level , but they have n't yet figured out this fundamental level . Once someone does ( which would pretty much be a guaranteed Nobel prize ) , we will know how gravity works . Until then , we can only speculate .",0

"Help Me Please ! Algebra no understand ! ? How do you find the slope of an linear equation your help would be great ! The slope , as it was taught to me simply long ago is just this : `` The rise over the run . '' What this means is the distance of the 'y ' coordinate , divided by the distance of the 'x ' coordinate.To give an example that 's a little more easy to grasp , consider walking up a flight of stairs . Measure the distance from the bottom floor to the floor at the top of the stairs , that height is your 'rise ' . Now , measure the distance between the first stair on the flight and the last stair that was climbed horizontally , and that is your 'run'.Once you have those two measurements , you can calculate the slope by dividing the height of the floor above by the length taken up by the stairs to get there . Draw the stairs as a right triangle.The right side is the rise , the bottom is the run , and the 'hypotenuse ' is the square root of the sum of both . The 'slope ' , is the right side divided by the bottom .",0

"How does temperature affect the taste of food and drink ? For example , white wine , tap water , Cointreau , lager and even chocolate taste much better cold . On the other hand , tea , coffee and brandy , as well as most cooked meals , taste much better warm or hot . English beer and red wine are better at room or cellar temperature . Why ? Heat amplifies smell , and most of `` taste '' is actually based on smell . Without smell , coffee and chocolate would just be bitter anf gross . So aromatic things smell more strongly . Cold also delays the taste of things , so cold chocolate probably loses enough of the bitterness by being cold , while retaining enough aroma , such that that might make it better . Of course , if you like your chocolate bitter ( like I do ) you wo n't prefer it cold for taste reasons . I think cold chocolate -- especially dark chocolate -- is too tasteless.Occasionally there is a matter of texture as well . With chocolate , for instance , I 'd dispute that it tastes better cold , but it is certainly less melty . With beer/lager/ale , heat can make it go flat , which affects its taste , but with liquor , the intense burn of the alcohol makes the burn worse . Aromatic liquors like brandy/cognac and whiskey/scotch are heated to allow the aromas to be stronger , but really , most all alcohol is innately gross , and is an acquired taste -- so people tend to learn to like them in particular ways , but I do n't think any of it is particularly innate . Cognac , scotch , and fine wine all take years to `` learn '' to appreciate .",0

"Why Santa Claus is dressed is red ? Santa in his red/white garb was propagated many years before the images produced for Coke.In 1822 , Clement Clarke Moore , an Episcopal minister , wrote a long Christmas poem for his three daughters entitled , `` An Account of a Visit from St . Nicholas . '' Moore 's poem , which he was initially hesitant to publish due to the frivolous nature of its subject , is largely responsible for our modern image of Santa Claus as a `` right jolly old elf '' with a portly figure and the supernatural ability to ascend a chimney with a mere nod of his head ! Although some of Moore 's imagery was probably borrowed from other sources , his poem helped to popularize the now-familiar idea of a Santa Claus who flew from house to house on Christmas Eve—in `` a miniature sleigh '' led by eight flying reindeer , whom he also named—leaving presents for deserving children . `` An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas , '' created a new and immediately popular American icon . In 1881 , political cartoonist Thomas Nast drew on Moore 's poem to create the first likeness that matches our modern image of Santa Claus . His cartoon , which appeared in Harper 's Weekly , depicted Santa as a rotund , cheerful man with a full , white beard , holding a sack laden with toys for lucky children . It is Nast who gave Santa his bright red suit trimmed with white fur , North Pole workshop , elves , and his wife , Mrs. Claus .",0

"When I read Isaiah 53 , I see the saving death of Jesus perfectly described there . Why do n't the Jews see Him ? It is not that the Jews are blind , it is that Christians see the Hebrew Scriptures through Jesus-colored glasses . Since they read the Christian 's New Testament first , then the TaNaCH , they see the TaNaCH through the lens of Christianity . If read on its own , with no knowledge of , or belief in , Christianity , the Hebrew Scriptures would not be seen as being about Jesus.Jews dont see the Christian interpretation in Isaiah 53 , because it contradicts what the Hebrew Scriptures , the Bible says , clearly and consistently , in at least 3 places : In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself as an atonement for the sins of the people . To be written out of God 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . God 's response was `` No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : '' Exodus 32:30-35And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Eternal ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Eternal , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Eternal said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book ... nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the father . Every man must die for his own sin.The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for God 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and God will forgive us . Nowhere in this chapter does it say that we have to have a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins.Ezekiel 18:1-4 ; 20-24 ; 26-27 ... ..Behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul that sinneth , it shall die ... .The soul that sinneth , it shall die . The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father , neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son : the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him , and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him . But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die . All his transgressions that he hath committed , they shall not be mentioned unto him : in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live . Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die ? saith the Eternal God : and not that he should return from his ways , and live ? So , either Deuteronomy 24:16 , `` Every man must die for his own sin '' does not mean that 'every man must die for his own sin , ' and the Christian interpretation of Isaiah 53 is correct , or the Christian interpretation of Isaiah 53 is not correct , and Deuteronomy 24:16 , 'Every man must die for his own sins ' means exactly what it says.Furthermore , Jews read Isaiah up to ( and including Isaiah 53 ) and Isaiah repeatedly refers specifically to the Jews as Gd 's servant . Read Isaiah 41:8 ; Isaiah 44:21 ; Isaiah 45:4 ; Isaiah 49:3 ; Isaiah 44:1 ; Isaiah 48:20 and Isaiah 49:7 Lets concentrate on Isaiah 43:10 : :Isaiah 43:10 `` You are my witnesses , saith the Etrnl , and my servant whom I have chosen : that ye may know and believe me , and understand that I am he : before me there was no Gd formed , neither shall there be after me .

"what are the reasons of diabetes ? how can it be prevented , and best practices to aviod this disease there are two types , type 1 and type 2. type one is a defect with your pancreas , which is usually diganosed before puberty . there is no way to prevent type 1. type 2 is completely preventable . type 2 is the most common , something like 98 % of the cases , and this is caused by being overweight . there has been a strong link , where if it runs in your family , you are more suseptible to it . the best way to prevent this is to stay close to your ideal body weight . this can be calculated by the equation : For males : Ideal body weight= 50 + ( 2.3 x Height in inches over 5ft ) for females : IBW= 45.5 + ( 2.3 x Height in inches over 5ft ) These give your weight in kilograms , to convert to pounds , multiply by 2.2for example if your a woman 5'5 '' the equation would be : IBW= 45.5 + ( 2.3 x 5 ) = 57 kg x 2.2 = 125.4 lbs.If you stay close to your ideal body weight , you have almost no chance of developing type 2 diabetes . For type 2 diabetes , it all has to do with your weight , not what you eat.The reason why you do n't want type 2 diabetes if because there are MANY complications associated with it , including cataracts , blindness , heart disease and amputations , just to name a small few.If you are overweight , find a great support group and lose weight the old-fashioned way , diet and exercise .

"why are people so ignorant about the Pagan based religions or witchcraft ? Well , you are certain to get a bunch of Christians jumping on this one , which may be an answer in itself . Much ignorance is due to having a different point of view ( usually christian , but perhaps other `` standard '' religions as well ) that prevents you from seeking real facts.Secondly , the pagan mysteries have long protected themselves , hiding behind symbols , misdirection and so on , because of persecution . Remember the burning times ! ( i.e. , the inquisition . ) Also , I think many modern pagans , witches , wicca , ( use what term you will ) , believe that only a small percentage of people are capable of being a part of the pagan world : one might almost call it snobbery . Think of Malfoy and his contempt for anyone who is not born a `` pureblood '' witch or wizard . You think Rawlings pulled that out of pure imagination ?

"I recently discovered that my ascendant sign was Aires rather than cancer , how would this affect my chart ? My sun sign is `` virgo '' and I 'm particularly interested in the `` Love '' and `` Career '' elements of my chart . It mainly affects which horoscopes you should read . The rising sign is just as important as the Sun sign , and sometimes more so . You need to read Aries as well as Virgo.Horoscope forecasts are written as if each sign is in the rising position ( the `` 9 o'clock '' on a horoscope chart ) . Houses are arranged counterclockwise : the second house is at `` 8 o'clock , '' the third house is at `` 7 o'clock , '' and so on . If you 're a Virgo with Aries rising , Aries is at `` 9 o'clock '' ( first house ) and Virgo is five signs away at `` 4 o'clock '' ( sixth house ) .Horoscope forecasts describe events that relate to planetary activity in the houses . They 'll often describe the effect of a particular planet on each of the signs , and the planet will affect each sign in different ways.Let 's say the day 's forecasts talk about a planet that 's currently in Saggitarius . In a Virgo forecast , this would affect the person 's home and family life , since Sagittarius is on usually on the cusp of the fourth house of a chart with Virgo rising . This forecast would only be relevant to people of *any* sun sign with Virgo rising , but not Virgos with a different rising sign . A person with Aries rising ( and *any* sun sign ) would read the Aries forecast . That same planet in Sagittarius would affect the Aries forecast differently : The forecast would likely describe travel , higher education , or religion , since since Sagittarius is on usually on the cusp of the ninth house of a chart with Virgo rising . This forecast would only be relevant to people of *any* sun sign with Aries rising , but *not* Aries people with a different rising sign.This is why you need to read the chart for your rising sign ( Aries ) , so that you get the correct effect of the planetary activity in question.Hope this helps .",0

"why is the sun yellow ? The sun is really yellow and if you were on a planet far far away and looked at our sun , depending on how far you really are ( faint stars are hard to make out period ) , you 'd see a star with a yellowish tinge.You can go out on your backyard on a clear night and see stars of various colors.Capella is a bright yellow star in Auriga , Betelgeuse is a red star in Orion , etc.Stars come in various colors : white , red , blue , yellow.You can mainly tell how hot a star is by its color : I believe the order is blue ( hottest ) , white , yellow , red ( coolest ) .Light is radiation , things at different temperatures radiate different wavelengths of light . You can see this in real life : A candle flame is yellow , but a blowtorch , which is much hotter , is blue.Color also gives astronomers an indication of how old the star is : Stars cool down as they age , so a red star would be very old and on its way to dyinng ( Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star , on its way out ) , while white and blue stars are more recently formed",0

If it 's the sex , then you will get bored and horny . If it is the looks then you will get bored and want to see that person . But , if it is love , then you miss seeing that person , and maybe even the sex , but you will not get bored because just hearing the person 's voice will make your heart skip a beat . But , my advice to you is that you should n't have sex with a person until you have established that fact anyhow . Sex complicates things !",0

"what does `` nobody can make you feel infrior without your permission '' mean ? what does `` nobody can make you feel inferior without your permission '' mean ? No one can MAKE you feel anything ( except physical pain of course ) . If you 're a professional dancer and some accountant who knows nothing about dance tells you you 're terrible , you 'll dismiss it because you do n't value his opinion . But if an accomplished dancer who you respect says the same thing it might make you actually question your talents , and feel inferior . In this case you would have given the dancer , but not the accountant , permission to make to make you feel inferior.But of course it might turn out that the dancer is old and bitter and wants to squash your potential by attacking your confidence . The key is to develop a solid sense of who you are - both your strengths and weaknesses . If someone attacks something you know is a strength , it should n't bother you . And if they attack something you know is a weakness - that really should n't bother you either because you 've accepted that this particular aspect is not your strongest .",0

"Do Photons have any mass ? ( explain ) ? if yes , so why the Photon 's mass does n't increase while moving in the speed of light.and if no , so why a Photon hits an electron , the electron starts moving and the lights frequence increases ? ? ? It is not possible to experimentally measure something to have a value of exactly zero . The current limit on the mass of the photon is < 10^25 times lighter than the proton.The idea of a particle 's mass changing with velocity has not been used by serious physicists for several decades . We now rewrite the momentum equation asmomentum = gamma*mass*velocity , where the factor gamma describes the effect previously known as `` relativistic mass '' .The energy of a particle is energy = gamma * mass * c^2 ( try setting gamma=1 for a stationary particle ) so we can write momentum = energy * velocity / c^2or momentum = energy/c for particles moving at the speed of light.So , even though a photon has zero ( or very small ) mass , it still has momentum , which it can transfer to an electron .",0

"what does the internal atomic structure of a mineral most likely determines ? color , age , streak , origin ... I am not going to pick any of those choices because I do n't believe any of those are correct , including streak . What you are describing is crystal structure , which might be related to color and streak , but since trace impurities in a mineral often determine color , and streak is nothing more than the color of a powdered form of the mineral I do n't think It will be determined by atomic structure with certainty . Most streaks are white ! Cleavage would be a correct answer but it was not included above . Cleavage and crystal structure are closely related properties . What you have described is the crystal structure . All minerals can be classified within 14 basic crystal lattice arrangements of the atoms in three dimensions . These 14 lattice arrangements fit within 7 larger crystal systems , allowing the classification of atomic structure of all known minerals . To see diagrams of these go here : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure",0
"Why are Christians so mean ? I 'm watching the news and what do I see ? They are now out picketing at funerals of dead soldiers that `` God hates fags '' . Yep . They are picketing the private mourning of families of solders , straight or gay , whose lives were tragically destroyed.I 'll admit , the whole God thing is a joke anyway , but is n't this just getting out of control ? I wish some crazed lunatic would drive by their picket line and mow them all down while simultaneously blowing their church to the top of Mt . Ararat.And since I 'm sure there will be a barrage of people saying the picketers are on the fringe , I have to say unfortunately they are not . They are all over the place . In our White House and now running the Supreme Court.I dare any one of you to actually read , word for word , the first four books of the Bible and tell me if you find it to be anything short of totally delusional.There are no such things as talking animals or invisible dead people with wings . Fred Phelps and the members of the Westboro Baptist Church *are* a fringe element . Most Christians would *not* picket the funeral of a deceased homosexual , or a deceased soldier who died in Iraq ( yep , Fred Phelps does that too ) . He is a crazy man who just happens to have a few followers , and they are very vocal . However , many bad things in the world have been perpetrated in the name of Christianity , such as the Crusades , slavery , witch hunts , the persecution of homosexuals , lesbians , bisexuals , and transgendered person today . This does not make all Christians `` mean '' or `` bad '' , just like all Russians are not tyrants because of Stalin and all Muslims are not out to destroy America because Al Queda makes attacks in the name of Islam and Allah . Individuals do bad things , groups are not to be defined by those individuals , even if there are a lot of them.Furthermore , the first 4 books of the Bible ( Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , and Numbers ) are not , strictly speaking , Christian compositions . They are the first 4 books of the Jewish Torah , and the Christians `` inherited '' them . This is *not* an attempt to say that `` it 's not Christians who are crazy , it 's the Jews ! `` , but rather a clarification as to the origin of those texts . They certainly *are* Christian texts in that they are used extensively by Christians and form a great deal of basic Christian belief ( the Creation , the Flood , the Abrahamic Promise , etc. ) . The Muslims *also* use these texts as a foundation for Islam , because they also consider themselves to be children of the Abrahamic Promise , descended from Abraham 's elder son , Ishmael . Thus , these books are given credence by three of the world 's major religions , making their `` delusional '' quality somewhat moot because of the sheer number of people who accept those `` delusions '' as true.There are a great many Christians who do try to conduct themselves well , based on their intreptation of what that means . Now , I do n't like their stance on abortion , but it comes from a genuine interest in the rights of the unborn , as people , as opposed to a genuine desire to degrade women to the simple status of breeding stock . Many Christians give charitable donations , such as for the tsunami or Hurricane Katrina , or other disasters . Many Christians go out of their way to be kind to other people . And many of these `` kind '' Christians do n't go about blowing their `` Look at me , I 'm a Christian '' whistle , the way the `` mean '' ones seem to do so often . So , the answer would be that individual Christians are mean for the same reason that individual atheists , individual Muslims , individual police officers , individual cat-kicking children , or individual pizza delivery guys are mean . They just are , and it 's not a reflection on the group at large .",0

Why Non Muslim can not enter muslim holy site ( Macca as example ) . What actually this mean ? ? 1 . Mouhammad used to tell his companions every piece of Quran that he recieves and they used to write it . It was not compiled into one book until after his death though . After he Died , The rulers made sure when they compiled the Quran that every verse they got through a trustworthie person and he had to have 2 witnesses that heard the Prophet say that verse.The significance of Mouhammad not being able to read or write , means that he couldnt have been able to come up with such PERFECT words . That proved to everyone that these words where Alla 's words2 . Non muslims CAN enter mosques .

"can wood be liquified ? well , it depends on what you mean by `` liquefied '' . most certainly it can be ground or sanded into a fine dust ( sawdust ) and then mixed with water - voila , liquified wood.on the other hand , if you mean melted , the way you melt ice or iron.. not really , no . wood is a pretty complex substance , with lots of different kinds of chemicals arranged into cells . chemically speaking , it 's mostly carbon and water , and trace amounts of a bazillion other chemicals . if you heat it up , some other chemical reactions will happen first ( combustion , for instance , in the presence of oxygen ) . in the absence of oxygen , you make charcoal if you heat wood to around 300C - the water evaporates away , the bonds break and all the other chemicals are driven out . what 's left is a chunk of solid , mostly ( 90 % ) carbon in noncrystalline or `` amorphous '' form . if you KEEP heating it , always without any oxygen because it 'll burn otherwise - eventually this stuff will melt , but solid carbon melts at around 3800C , which is getting pretty close to the temperature of the surface of the sun . so it 's pretty difficult to do , though if you increase the pressure , the melting temperature will go down - this is how they make synthetic diamonds.otherwise , wood can be `` liquefied '' through other chemical processes , such as decomposition/rotting - this is where oil comes from - but by the time it 's liquid , it hardly qualifies as wood anymore.so , i guess the short answer to the question is no , it ca n't be .",0

It consists of the word `` Steelers '' surrounded by three astroids ( hypocycloids of four cusps ) . The yellow hypocycloid represents coal , the red one is for ore , and the blue one represents steel scrap.The team 's colors are black and gold , with their helmet being solid black with a gold central stripe and small white uniform numbers on the forehead . The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts their logo on only one side of the helmet ( the right side ) . At first , it was a test to see how the logo appeared on their helmets , but its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently .",0

I do n't know much about console programming.ALso , along with the software name , can you give me web sites that might help , and a number of the best programming languages . What you need is the SDK ( Software Development Kit ) for the particular console that you are developing for . Unfortunally these kits usually cost $ 10+ and even more unfortunally you ca n't get them . Most Console license holders ( like Microsoft or Sony ) will only lease a kit to you if you a big company with an active title in development and a published deal ready . It is almost impossible to get a kit if you are a single developer.I suggest making a PC game with DirectX , the directX SDK is free . It is a good place to get started and Microsoft 's Xbox uses a very similar almost identical interface . So if you can swing a publisher deal and convince Microsoft to let use use a SDK you wo n't have much trouble getting your game to work on the XBox.When you game is ready License holder will put your game through a set of rigorious tests to see if it is stable and conforms to all the rules of the particular system , if that all works out they will allow you to release the game.Almost every professional game with VERY few exceptions are written in C++.Compared to all this making the game work on a HD Televison is trival .",0

what is a double layer DVD burner ? Movie DVDs you buy in the store can contain up to 8.5 gigabytes of data . This is because they are pressed ( as opposed to burned ) dual-layer DVDs ( also called DVD-9 ) . The recordable DVD+-Rs that have been on the market for a while a single-layer DVD-5s and can store up to 4.7 gigabytes . This disrepency is why programs that copy movie DVDs need to compress the DVD content after unencrypting it before they can be burned to a normal DVD . Recently new DVD burners and media were introduced that allowed people to burn DVD-9 DVDs reasonably affordably.So a double-layer DVD burner is one that is capable of burning 8.5 gigabyte DVD-9 format DVDs.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvd # Technical_information,0

"Is something wrong with YAHOO Fantasy sports ? ? I am not sure what exactly you mean . If you mean technical problems ? well sometimes the log in page doesn ' load and I have to refresh the page a few times . That seems to be a Yahoo problem in generalif you mean the game itself , it is generally good but I would suggest some improvements.1- the number one improvement that is absolutely necessary is the IR/IL lists . Sometimes other website report that certain players , eg . Ed Jovonavski or Amare Stoudomire have been put on the IR . Yahoo however , does n't follow suit immidiately , they are a few days late . They have to keep in mind that those few days are very important for some of us . 2- KEPPER LEAGUE OPTION : I play Keeper leagues , meaning that I have inherited a team and its minor league system ( in case of hockey ) . I get to trade draft picks , prospects and active players . I think it would be better if Yahoo had a keeper league option . a ) That way we would n't have to set up a new league every season . b ) I 'd also suggest that they have a minor league section as part of this keeper league option . We could then keep our prospects who are not yet part of the NHL on our minor league roster . That way no other GM accidentally picks these guys up and also we wo n't forget about one of our many prospects . c ) When trades occure , they need to announce to the other GM 's all parts of the trade . As you know , when you trade in Yahoo leagues , it also gives the GM an comment box in which people that play keeper leagues put names of prospects or draft picks . As it 's currently set , these comments do n't appear to the other GM 's when the trade is accepted . For us the active players that are exchanged is one thing , most of the time it 's the draft picks and prospects that are the real deal makers . Right now GMs have to post extra comments letting everyone else know of the trade . IMO that needs to change.that 's it for now till I think of other things .",0

That will make it too easy to at least have an `` emotional '' affair , if not slip into a physical one . But try writing letters and e-mails to your spouse , bettering yourself while he/she is gone ( working out , learning to cook , joining a club or group , volunteering , taking a second job , reading , painting , restoring furniture , taking an evening or online class , etc. ) . I try to make sure my focus while my husband is away is on what I will do better when he 's back - do n't lose the focus on the spouse , or that will make it harder ! - and on staying busy so I do n't have time to just sit and miss him .

"why do some people get addicted to drugs and some do n't ? Addiction to drugs and alcohol tends to run in families and may have to do with how the brain processes certain chemicals , particularly those of the `` feel good '' type , which may be lacking or dormant in the addict until they are activated by drugs or alcohol . According to Carl Jung , alcoholic drinking is seen as a reflection of the human need , gone wrong , for a spiritual life . In a famous letter to Bill Wilson , Jung wrote that the craving for alcohol is the equivalent , on a low level , of the spiritual thirst of our being for wholeness , or union with God . Jungnotes that in the word alcohol in Latin is spiritus , a word that describes the highest religious experience , as well as the most depraving poison . In solving the problem of alcoholism , Jung offered the formula spiritus contra spiritum . A figurative translation of this Latin formular is , `` it takes the Spirit of God to overcome the harmful spirit of alcohol . ”",0

Any suggestions to improve on the number of bids per item ? I 've found that one of the best ways to maximize the number of bids is to start your auction with a lower price . Consider .99 cents ; it will generally bump up the total number of bids , but will also cost you less to list the auction ! As for when you start and end your auctions , you really have to consider your audience and research what time of day other folks are getting the best prices for their wares . I try to start most auctions on Sunday night at 6 PM Pacific time ( eBay 's default time is Pacific time ) . However , most of what I sell is bought by people here in the states -- if you have more international buyers , then a different time might work better for you.Hope this helps !",0

"I am 21 so why do n't i have regular periods ? Hormonal imbalances . Usually caused by diet . If you are too thin , you may not have enough body fat - it 's actually the cholesterol in your body ( fat ) that is used to make estrogen . Fatter women tend to look `` softer '' or more feminine.Estrogen is used to make the lining of your uterus that you shed every month.But progesterone is used to coagulate the lining so it sheds at a regular time period . It 's released after the egg is released , so it gets higher just before your period . Certain foods can interfere with the balance of estrogen and progesterone . Soy foods are particularly high in estrogen and can throw things off balance . Progesterone is also released from the adrenal glands , which also release cortisol - a stress hormone . Too much stress makes the adrenals concentrate on releasing cortisol and not on progesterone . Again , things get out of balance.Try to eliminate soy products ( and they are everywhere - most `` vegetable oils '' are soy oil ) and see if that helps . Do some deep breathing and meditation to relax and reduce the cortisol levels .",0

"What is the physics behind walking of insects on water surface ? Explain please. ? Surface tension , or the attraction of water molecules sideways and inwards at the surface of the water , cause water to act like an elastic trampoline . This lets the animal float without breaking the surface.To propel itself forward , the insect 's feet must push water backward ( for every action of the bug there is an equal and opposite reaction on the water ) . The rowing action of the legs produces miniature vortices ( whirlpools ) which move backward from the bug 's feet .",0

"how does brokeback mountain end ? I live in a town so republican there are no democrats on the ballots . There is no way it will show here and the local Walmart will not carry the DVD . The library does not carry the book , ( short Story/article ) and I do n't have the money to travel 75 miles and pay $ 10 to see it in Wenatchee . Well , just like in real life , Jack gets murdered for his relations with men . The Good Ol ' Boys , the same people that burn crosses and love a good hangin ' , got their tire irons and tortured him to death -- most likely the father-in-law and some of his drinkin ' buddies . Ennis shuffles around in life , without two nickels to rub together , thinking about Jack , knowing he will never have a relationship with or ever fall in love with anyone again . The real sadness is that two people who in a one-in-a-million chance found true love -- their soulmates , but could not make it work . They tried to blend , and live their lives together discreetly , but it just did n't work . Jack had more interactions with other men , so he was more likely to be caught.The frustrating thing about the 60 's and 70 's was people 's inability to talk . The most was said when nobody was talking . Ennis 's wife tried to talk about it , but Ennis ran out during a Thanksgiving dinner . In the end , Ennis learns about Jack 's death from his wife , who tells a lie to cover up the truth , saying while Jack was changing a tire it blew off the rim and killed him . We are n't told if Ennis believes the lie or knows what really happened . Ennis goes to Jack 's parents ' ranch . He goes to Jack 's room , and finds both his shirt and Jack 's shirt from their summer together on the mountain , hung together on the same hangar . Jack 's mother loved Jack , regardless of his sexuality . There was so much said between the mother and Ennis without one word spoken -- and that was the beauty of the film . The mother knew how much Jack loved Ennis , and she realized that both she and Ennis both loved Jack more than any other people in his life . Jack 's early end was felt most deeply by Ennis and the mother , and you could see the pain in both characters.The only thing of value in Ennis 's life is his love and relationship with Jack . He loves his daughters , but that really is n't on the same level as his relationship with Jack . He keeps the two shirts on the hangar in his closet hung on a peg . This is a symbol of their love -- the shirts being on the same hangar , being together , signify their oneness . That 's why Ennis could not love again , because he became one ( stop the star wars jokes ) with the one he loved . His acknowledgment , and his keeping the shirts , showed that his love for Jack would never die.What I respect most about the film was the way both Jack and Ennis were portrayed . It was very anti-media : there were no men wearing women 's clothes , or talking with lisps , or waving their hands around like little girls . There were no metrosexual marketing schemes , lipstic , or bulging 70 's bell-bottom pants . These were guys who grew up in rural areas and participated as men in all activities , including rodeo , ranching , and making babies . They fully functioned in the tradional sense , in the way people think `` men '' are supposed to act . The only difference was they fell in love with each other . When you escape all the homosexual stereotypes , I ended up forgetting about the gender altogether -- I saw two people in love , a love forbidden by local customs and culture . I wish you could see the film for yourself . Many people I am sure reacted like ol ' Winky . Hate is found in many forms , and passed on from generation to generation , In God 's Holy Name , of course , to give it extra punch . The one and only God of creation , the God who bore me and bore the universe , would never condemn true love between two people , period . Rules and cultural moreys are created by man , for man . Love transcends all those boundaries , and should be respected and nurtured . If hell exists , you can bet there is a special place in hell for people who go out and torture other people ...",0

Hi how can I connect my printer to both of my computers where it will print from either one without me having to unplug it and set ip up everytime on the computer I wish to print . That would depend on what kind of connector ( s ) your printer has : if it has a parallel/Centronics connector , there are parallel switches which would do the trick . If it has a network/Ethernet connection , a router or hub or switch ( depending on your network setup ) would be the easiest - if you have one of those three already , you would connect the printers network cable to the router or hub or switch and then should be able to set it up on both computers through Windows printer sharing . If it has a USB connector , I 'm not sure if you can share a printer through a USB hub , but there are USB-to-Ethernet adapters that might also work in conjunction with a router or hub or switch .",0

"how can i help others who have lost loved ones recentlyas people have helped me online ? 1 lost my 60 yr old sister in sept and 4mo greatgrandson in dec and 32 yr old daughter in jan.people here have helped me to get on with life and that i will not know why this has happened till i see god.i go to church and that has helped.i pray to god several times a day.i am raising my daughter 's 10 yr old daughter and know i have to go on for her.i have a husband and 4 sons 8 other grandchildren.i know all this that has happened will take time to get through which is not easy and that i will never forget.we go to counseling which has helped.just thought i could help someone like others have helped me and still do . That is so awful . They say you always lose people in 3 's . Anyway , it is important for me to tell you this ... Before we all came to this place we had a plan already written . In that plan we have 5 ways we can chose to leave this earth to go to the other side . You sister was needed by God at that time . She left to help God . You great-grandson was never meant to come to earth yet , so God took him back until it was the right time . Our world just was n't ready for the great being he will now be in another life . Your daughter had to go to the other side because it was in your life plan to take care of your granddaughter . I know this all sounds really freaky but believe me ... you are doing a great job holding it together . You should n't be worried about helping other people especially on Yahoo ! Answers , because your family is going through thier own grieving process and they need you . You are their rock . This is your plan .",0

Somethings in the bible dont quite sound right , but when you understand it and read the whole story of whats going on it all makes sense .

Please direct me to the scripture where you claim it says `` God made one sun , and one solar system . `` `` Humans traveling to space proves the tower of Babalon wrong .

"Why do so many women like bad boy types ? The debate of `` nice guys vs. bad boys '' has been raging for quite a long time . The nature of being a `` nice guy '' , however , is commonly misunderstood . It is believed that being polite , considerate , friendly , tender , romantic , etc . is what being a `` nice guy '' is all about and thus those qualities should be avoided , as it is the `` bad boy '' , the rude , the inconsiderate , the impolite , the rough guy who always gets the girl while the `` nice guy '' is waiting outside in the pouring rain with flowers in his hand.It does n't mean that women prefer rude over polite , inconsiderate over considerate , etc . It all becomes clear when we look at a very important issue often overlooked when trying to define what makes the `` bad boys '' beat the `` nice guys '' when it comes to getting the girls . It is sexuality - the `` bad boys '' are not afraid to show that they are sexual beings , while the `` nice guys '' hide their sexuality as a part of their agenda of being friendly , polite , and courteous towards women .",0

That is why you are more likely to have headaches . Some headaches are n't physical but rather psycho - somatic . It has been found in psychology , that if you feel stressed about something , or you feel guily about an emotion you should n't experience , it might easier be translated into physical terms , such as headaches , neckaches , etc.Plus , if want to know about sex , I assume you have n't experienced it much before . That is a kind of imbalance that may affect people differently.The key to solving both your study problems , and your sex curiosity appears to be simple , relaxation . One question you should ask yourself , how often do you let yourself go , relax . Some people find it to be the greatest aspect of sexual satisfaction , a kind of relief , feellings of floatiness , etc . Maybe unconsciously your body knows what you want , more even than you do , and prods you in that direction , of completely giving in to relaxation.But that is just an opinion , your medical health provider might know more.Hope that helps .",0

"Is body odor really an aphrodisiac ? Here 's some text from a 2002 study reported in Neuroendrocrinology Letters that indicates male pheremones ( at the heart of `` body odor '' ) may have a positive attractiveness effect to a majority of women.Previous research has revealed that natural and synthetic pheromones can enhance ratings of opposite sex attractiveness . The present study investigated the effects of exposure to male axillary secretions on female ratings of the sexual attractiveness of male stimuli . Thirty-two female undergraduates , half of whom were contraceptive pill users , rated male vignette characters and photographs of male faces on aspects of attractiveness . On two separate study days , corresponding to different phases of their menstrual cycle , stimuli were presented while exposed to male axillary pheromones and under a control condition ( no pheromone ) . The order of testing was balanced with respect to pheromone/control condition and menstrual cycle phase . Pheromone exposure resulted in significantly higher attractiveness ratings of vignette characters and faces . Use of the contraceptive pill or menstrual cycle phase had equivocal effects on some vignette items and neither had any influence on female ratings of male facial attractiveness . The results of this study suggest that exposure to natural male axillary pheromones can significantly enhance female perceptions of various aspects of male attractiveness. -- -- -There 's no question that overt and extreme body odor is repellent to many ( and certainly it can be ! ) -- especially since we 've been trained by countless advertisements to find it so . However , it 's an evolutionary adaptation of some kind , which ( certainly in the pre-bath eras ) must have operated as a signal of some kind to females : of health , of strength , of non-sickness perhaps .",0

"Why does n't the Jewish religion believe in Jesus if he was a Jew ? Maybe this is all ignorance on my part . I do n't know . I really want to know . Truly and honestly , I 'm just trying to educate myself further . Any explanations are greatly appreciated . PLEASE look at the following : :http : //WhatJewsBelieve.orghttp : //Convert.org The basic beliefs of Christianity about Jesus are against what the Bible says , and so Real Jews can not believe in Jesus at all.The Christian understanding is that the Messiah , Jesus , died for the sins of the people . The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin.But we are taught in our Torah that no one can die for the sins of another . In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death forthe fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin ( eesh b ’ chet-o yumatu ) .In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself to atone for the sins of the people . To be written out of Gd 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . Gd 's response is No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : Exodus 32:30-35 And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Etrnl ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Etrnl , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Etrnl said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book . The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for Gd 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd will forgive us.So , the Bible is clear , no one can die for the sins of another , and this means that Jesus can not die for anyone else 's sins.Christians also believe that one needs a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin , that one who does not have such a blood sacrifice will die in their sins , and go to hell , except for the sacrifice of Jesus.This , too , is UnBiblical . The Bible describes blood sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin in the Book of Leviticus . But it is in Leviticus itself , in the middle of the discussion of the sin sacrifices , that we are taught that we do not need a blood sacrifice to be forgiven for our sins . Offering a blood sacrifice was an expensive thing to do for the family offering the animal . Was forgiveness then , to be only for the rich ? No , because if one could not afford a blood sacrifice then one who sins could bring flour , which has no blood and no life as their sacrifice , and Gd forgave them ! Leviticus 5:11-13 ; But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering ; he shall put no oil upon it , neither shall he put any frankincense thereon : for it is a sin offering.Furthermore , read the Book of Jonah . In Jonah , the People of Ninevah do three things in order to be forgiven by Gd . They fast , they pray for forgiveness , and they stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgave them ! This is exactly what we do on Yom Kippur , we fast , we pray for forgiveness , and , hopefully , we stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgives us . And what book do we read on Yom Kippur afternoon ? The Book of Jonah ! Jonah 3:7-10 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Ninevah , by the decree of the King and his nobles , saying , Let neither man nor beast , herd nor flock taste anything ; let them not feed nor drink water ; but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto Gd ; yea , let them turn every one from his evil",0

"what is the chemical structure of the spider 's net ? The dragline silk of the Golden Orb-Weaving spider is the most studied in scientific research . Spider silk is a natural polypeptide , polymeric protein and is in the scleroprotein group which also encompasses collagen ( in ligaments ) and keratin ( nails and hair ) . These are all proteins which provide structure . The protein in dragline silk is fibroin ( Mr 200,000-300,000 ) which is a combination of the proteins spidroin 1 and spidroin 2 . The exact composition of these proteins depends on factors including species and diet . Fibroin consists of approximately 42 % glycine and 25 % alanine as the major amino acids . The remaining components are mostly glutamine , serine , leucine , valine , proline , tyrosine and arginine . Spidroin 1 and spidroin 2 differ mainly in their content of proline and tyrosine .",0

"' ... .and war broke out in heaven.. ' ? what could this possibly have been like ? please indulge me with your imagination , thank you . Satan Cast Out of HeavenIn the early part of our century , there was a war in heaven . The Bible book of Revelation describes what happened : “ And war broke out in heaven : Michael and his [ good ] angels battled with the dragon [ Satan ] , and the dragon and its [ bad ] angels battled but it did not prevail , neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven . So down the great dragon was hurled , the original serpent , the one called Devil and Satan , who is misleading the entire inhabited earth ; he was hurled down to the earth , and his [ bad ] angels were hurled down with him. ” What was the result ? The account continues : “ On this account be glad , you heavens and you who reside in them ! ” The good angels could be glad because Satan and the bad angels , or spirits , were no longer in heaven . But what about people on earth ? The Bible says : “ Woe for the earth and for the sea , because the Devil has come down to you , having great anger , knowing he has a short period of time. ” —Revelation 12:7-9 , 12.Yes , Satan and his wicked companions mislead and cause great woe for people on earth .

"Who invented the `` modem '' and when ? Tomlinson invented email in 1972.Digital modems developed from the need to transmit data for North American air defense during the 1950s . Modems were used to communicate data over the public switched telephone network or PSTN . Analog telephone circuits can only transmit signals that are within the frequency range of voice communication . A modem sends and recieves data between two computers . Modem stands for modulate/demodulate.In 1962 , the first commercial modem was manufactured - the Bell 103 by AT & T . The Bell 103 was also the first modem with full-duplex transmission , frequency-shift keying or FSK , and had a speed of 300 bits per second or 300 bauds.The 56K modem was invented by Dr. Brent Townshend in 1996.History of ModemsRobert Lucky invented the automatic adaptive equalizer in 1965 at Bell Laboratories.The Man behind the ModemsBrent Townshend , the man who dreamed up the idea for 56K bit/sec modems.Developer receives patent for PCM modemsBrent Townshend , the Quebec-based developer who worked on several core concepts for pulse-code modulated ( PCM ) modems , received several U.S. patents for that technology .",0

I 'm not gon na like them only because they 're so `` cool '' . Hell No.My opinionWho else feels the same ? My personal opinion as to why everyone is now a Green Day fan is that they have what is commonly reffered to as `` selling out '' . Large music lables dish out millions and millions to promote artists albums , and in return , get air time , national tours in large venues , and thier latest single played on Mtv ( the same corporation that tells you what to think , what to say , and what to listen to ) . It is because people are being force-fed this mainstream bullshit pop music , that people have infatuations with a particular group for an extended period of time . Also , to make more money for the record executives , bands sometimes release up to five singles off of just one album . This creates the illusion that the CD is doing well , and continues to place the band in the spotlight , in return , making more money . Bands with little or no talent ( Maroon 5 ) can ride an album for over 2 years without producing any new material .",0

"Why oil , ghee , butter and fried food is restricted for a daibatic , while they do not contain sugar ? Because everything you eat turns into glucose .

Protiens and complex carbohydrates turn to glucose slowest . So , eat lots of green veggies , beans , whole grains and lean meats and strictly limit or just do n't eat white flour , white rice , potatos , sugar , honey , corn syrup etc.If America were to eat like they have diabetes , this country would n't have as many over weight people who just might become diabetic !

You may have heard of the c , d , e , C , D and E genes . The upper case letters denote Rh positive genes and the lower case , negative and we inherit either a positive or negative of each gene from each parent ( eg . CDe/cde , cdE/cDe etc. ) .

"What is Islam and why is Islam ? What is Islam ? Islam is not a new religion , but the same truth that God revealed through all His prophets to every people . For a fifth of the world 's population , Islam is both a religion and a complete way of life . Muslims follow a religion of peace , mercy , and forgiveness , and the majority have nothing to do with the extremely grave events which have come to be associated with their faith.Who are the Muslims ? One billion people from a vast range of races , nationalities and cultures across the globe - from the southern Philippines to Nigeria - are united by their common Islamic faith . About 18 % live in the Arab world ; the world 's largest Muslim community is in Indonesia ; substantial parts of Asia and most of Africa are Muslim , while significant minorities are to be found in the Soviet Union , China , North and South America , and Europe.What do Muslims believe ? Muslims believe in One , Unique , Incomparable God ; in the Angels created by Him ; in the prophets through whom His revelations were brought to mankind ; in the Day of Judgement and individual accountability for actions ; in God 's complete authority over human destiny and in life after death . Muslims believe in a chain of prophets starting with Adam and including Noah , Abraham , Ishmael , Isaac , Jacob , Joseph , Job , Moses , Aaron , David , Solomon , Elias , Jonah , John the Baptist , and Jesus , peace be upon them . But God 's final message to man , a reconfirmation of the eternal message and a summing-up of all that has gone before was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through Gabriel.What does 'Islam ' mean ? The Arabic word 'Islam ' simply means 'submission ' , and derives from a word meaning 'peace ' . In a religious context it means complete submission to the will of God . 'Mohammedanism ' is thus a misnomer because it suggests that Muslims worship Muhammad rather than God . 'Allah ' is the Arabic name for God , which is used by Arab Muslims and Christians alike .",0
"how to increase self-esteem or confidence if you have acne scars and your classmates do n't have ? can you help me ? First recognize its not your fault . Its what makes you unique . You 're not sub-par , or defective , or less than others because you do n't have smooth flawless skin . You are different , but just as good . You still are beautiful/attractive . And others will think so too.Be happy . Have a pretty smile . Walk with confidence , knowing that you are beautiful/attractive . Focus on making others feel good about themselves . That 's really attractive . Walk with your head high . Shoulders back . Look at others in their eyes . Speak loud and clear . Smile often . Fake confidence until you feel it . At the same time , take good care of yourself , so that you can be your very best . Eat right . Drink plenty of water . Take vitamins . Get 8 hours sleep . Determine allergens , and eliminate them . ( I was seriously allergic to bleach , and it cause huge breakouts on my face ) Be proactive in treating your problems . Try products to help acne scars . ProActiv is very good on acne . But is you have deep scars , you need to resurface your skin . Try Obagi products . They work so well . You have to get them from a doctor or cosmetic surgen , and they are expensive , ( about $ 300 for about 3 months worth of supplies , after the initial kit , you just replace what you need at about $ 45 a month ) , but you 'll see beautiful skin . If you still feel down about yourself , try a bottle of the herb St. John 's Wort . You can buy it at Walmart . Its a mood elevator . It raises your melatonin and seratin levels and makes you feel better , so you can focus on the important things . Non-adddictive , and safe to use . Then do something that makes you feel proud of yourself . Stop doing things that you know are wrong . Set high goals . Volunteer . Teach a Sunday School class . Tutor children to read . Be nice to your family . Do other things to make you feel good about yourself . Your self esteem should be based on who you ARE and what you give to society . You want to look your best , and it makes you feel good , but your looks should NOT be the foundation of your self-esteem . How shallow is that ? And lastly , realize it could be a whole lot worse . I wish acne scars were my biggest problems in school .",0

"Do vitamins and other supplements really benefit you ? I am the world 's pickiest eater . I do not eat vegetables and I rarly eat fruit . Little meat and a lot of carbs . But I still want to stay healthy . So I want to know if this is a good way to do so without changing the way I am ? The human body comprises chemical compounds such as water , amino acids ( proteins ) , fatty acids ( lipids ) , nucleic acids ( DNA/RNA ) , and carbohydrates ( e.g . sugars ) . These compounds in turn consist of elements such as carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , and phosphorus , and may or may not contain minerals such as calcium , iron , and zinc . Minerals also ubiquitously occur in the form of salts and electrolytes . All of these chemical compounds and elements occur in various forms and combinations ( e.g . hormones/vitamins , phospholipids , hydroxyapatite ) , both in the human body and in organisms ( e.g . plants , animals ) that humans eat.The human body must necessarily comprise those elements that humans eat and absorb into the bloodstream . The digestive system , except in the unborn fetus , is the first step in helping to make the different chemical compounds and elements in food available for the trillions of cells of the body . In the digestive process of an average adult , about seven litres of liquid , known as digestive juices , exit the internal body and enter the lumen of the digestive tract . The digestive juices help break chemical bonds between ingested compounds as well as modulate the conformation and/or energetic state of the compounds/elements . Yet many compounds/elements are absorbed into the bloodstream unchanged , though the digestive process helps to release them from the matrix of the foods where they occur . Any unabsorbed matter is eliminated in the feces . Only a minimal amount of digestive juice is eliminated this way ; the intestines reabsorb most of it otherwise the body would rapidly dehydrate ( hence the devastating effects of persistent diarrhea ) .Study in this field must take into careful account the state of the body before ingestion and after digestion as well as the chemical content of both the food and the waste . The specific types of compounds and elements that are absorbed by the body can be determined by comparing the waste to the food . The effect that the absorbed matter has on the body can be determined by finding the difference between the pre-ingestion state and the post-digestion state . The effect may only be discernible after an extended period of time in which all food and ingestion must be exactly regulated and all waste must be analyzed . The number of variables ( e.g . 'confounding factors ' ) involved in this type of experimentation is very high . This makes scientifically valid nutritional study very time-consuming and expensive , which accounts for why a proper science of human nutrition is rather new.In general , eating a variety of fresh , whole ( unprocessed ) foods has proven hormonally and metabolically favourable compared to eating a monotonous diet based on processed foods . In particular , fresh , whole foods provide higher amounts and a more favourable balance of essential and vital nutrients per unit of energy , resulting in better management of cell growth , maintenance , and mitosis ( cell division ) as well as of appetite and energy balance . A generally more regular eating pattern ( e.g . eating medium-sized meals every 3 to 4 hours ) has also proven more hormonally and metabolically favourable than infrequent , haphazard food intake.Vitamins give you a complement among all the nutrients your body requires . It is not advisable at all to substitute entirely your meals with vitamins and dietary or food supplements . I recommend you to look for a nutritional advisor and discuss in which way you can adjust your meals , having all the necessary elements your body needs , plus , eating only what you like .",0

"While teaching grammar to students of English , are we allowed to use their mother tongue ? or English alone ? That 's a good question . Most countries that employ native English speakers to teach English do NOT want the teachers to speak anything but English . This can be beneficial for the students because they are literally flooded with English and have no resort but to learn as the days go by . It is akin to learning through immersion - which , from experience I can say is the best and easiest way to learn a language . If it 's all you hear all day long , you pick it up fast.However , it can be very difficult and daunting for students to hear only a language they have n't yet learned . When I taught English in Thailand , I could only speak English to them because I had n't yet learned Thai . But once I had enough Thai under my belt to speak to the students in their own language , it made it a LOT easier to make them understand the English I was trying to teach.So there are advantages and disadvantages to both ways .

Now it just sounds like they 're trying to make 'creative ' noise which in the end only amounts to average to below average college rock.I really think at this point in his career , Vedder should stay away from his attempts at 'harder ' edge rock , and concentrate on acoustic/folk which seem to have been the only consistent thing that has been good . I think as they grow older they sometimes try to reinvent themselves . Usually they find their way back to their original sound . I 'm still holding out . It wo n't be long ... ..just watch . : )",0
"why does my urine smell funny after I eat asparagus ? Funny ... I think the smell you are describing is directly related to a fart..Seriously..When you eat different things , does it not make your Farts smell differently . Think . What does a beer fart smell like ? ? How about when you eat beans ? What does it smell like when your Golden retriever eats beans ? ? ? Whoa ... Garbage in , garbage out . It either leaves out the anus or it leaves through your pee pee ... It takes with it what your body does not need.For the record , Mine Urine smells wierd when I take an antibiotic.That smell is much different than when I take a strong vitimin . Did ya notice it changes color too ? I wonder , if small paricles of your urine are floating around in the air when you pee so that you can smell it , Are germs floating around so you can inhale them too ? Could you get sick by smelling MY urine ? ? Why would you want to go around smelling urine ? GADS , I think I will pee sitting down for now on and flush 4 times .",0
"What is thought ? At its most basic level , thought can be viewed as a computation ( which in turn can be viewed as a change of state optionally coupled with some kind of input and output ) . There are all kinds of thought that are dealt with by different parts of the brain . These include motor skills , instincts and higher level reasoning like planning , creativity and consciousness . Your question spans a huge number of disciplines including philosophy , neuroscience , computer science , psychology , etc and is not satisfactorily answered today even with a lifetime of study . However , advances in this area occur daily . I can suggest three books for starters .",0

"If I use a mixture of a ten per cent of alcohol and a ninety per gasoline , does the octane increase its level ? Short answer : yes.Octane levels are based on what is called a `` knock resistance . '' When an engine burns gas , the smaller the gas molecules , the quicker it will burn . If it burns too quickly , the energy will be released faster than the piston can use the energy . The excess energy makes the piston rattle in the chamber , `` knocking '' back and forth -- if you 've ever heard a sound like rattling marbles in the engine of an old car climbing a hill , you know what I mean here.Octane is a hydrocarbon with eight carbon atoms ( hence the `` oct '' prefix ) . But gasoline that you get at the pump is not pure octane -- it contains some lighter stuff ( like hexane and septane ) and some heavier stuff ( like novane and decane ) . Plus , there are aspects of whether the molecules in the gas are in straight chains or in branched chains . But when a consumer buys gasoline , they need some sense of what they 're getting to make sure that they 're not getting crap that will burn too quickly and mess up their engine . So instead of trying to make all gas pure octane ( which would be ridiculously expensive and wasteful ) , or trying to give a consumer a detailed assay of the types of hydrocarbons in the gas ( which would be meaningless for the consumer and likewise expensive ) , they formulate the gas into certain knock ratios . The speed of burning is measured against 2,2,4-trimethylpentane ( a type of octane ) and n-pentane . So 87 octane gas knocks as much as a mixture of 13 % pentane and 87 % octane , etc . They compare the knocking effect.Ethanol helps to slow down the burning of the gas , and does work as an actane booster . The follwing link says that 10 % ethanol added to 92 octane will give an octane rating of 94.7 , but warns that ethanol is mildly corrosive to some engine parts .",0

"Would frozen blood bullets really kill someone ? My first thought is it sounds great but it probably wouldnt work . However I am not scientific at all so I though maybe someone could offer me better insight.And maybe a reason why or why not ? In English or German , the answer would be the same . Although the bullet may not cause enough physical damage , there are other things to consider , including site of entry.Mythbusters never shot a live animal ( too much fuss for a publicly viewed TV show ) . If they had , they might have answered the question better . If shot into major artery , the vicitm would probably die of blood loss . I am not sure of what would happen if shot into the ear or the roof of the mouth . If the victim lived , it might never be the same.Unlike the water bullet , if the blood was the vicitm 's , I do not think this could be discovered . I loved the question .",0

"Pope Benedict 's stance on the Charasmatic Renewal ? What is Pope Benedicts stance on the Charasmatic Renewal of the Catholic Church . I recieved the Holy Ghost , with tongues , in Catholicism.I was under the impression then that Pope John Paul II had a favorable attitude towards it , but what about the current Pope Benedics ? I think that Pope Benedict is in support of this movement in general , though he , like others in the Catholic hierarchy , has some concerns about it . He seems to support the movement , but reminds members to stay connected to the whole Church . The quotation below is from before he was elected Pope . For his part , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , has added his voice to the Pope 's in acknowledging the good occurring in the Charismatic Renewal and providing some cautions . In a forward to a book by Cardinal Suenens , at that time the Pope 's delegate to the Charismatic Renewal , the Prefect comments on the Post-Conciliar period stating , '' At the heart of a world imbued with a rationalistic skepticism , a new experience of the Holy Spirit suddenly burst forth . And , since then , that experience has assumed a breadth of a worldwide Renewal movement . What the New Testament tells us about the charisms - which were seen as visible signs of the coming of the Spirit - is not just ancient history , over and done with , for it is once again becoming extremely topical . `` Speaking of the book 's subject , renewal and the powers of darkness , he says , '' What is the relation between personal experience and the common faith of the Church ? Both factors are important : a dogmatic faith unsupported by personal experience remains empty ; mere personal experience unrelated to the faith of the Church remains blind . `` Finally , he urges those who read the book to pay special attention to the author 's double plea , '' ... to those responsible for the ecclesiastical ministry - from parish priests to bishops - not to let the Renewal pass them by but to welcome it fully ; and on the other ( hand ) ... to the members of the Renewal to cherish and maintain their link with the whole Church and with the charisms of their pastors . `` [ Renewal and the Powers of Darkness , Leo Cardinal Suenens ( Ann Arbor : Servant Books , 1983 ) ]",0

This is similar to flowing water . The water in a lake at the top of the hill has more potential energy than the water in the lake at the bottom of the hill . The water will flow downhill only .

'' Society can screw itself . If you `` need '' society 's respect , they have power over you . Do you want to be in that situation ? ? ? ? Only you can truly know if you are worthy of respect . Whether they in society respond to you with respect can sometimes be in error . Some of the most respected people , say in a corporate work situation , are complete idiots -- not worthy of any respect at all , yet they are shown respect for all the wrong reasons . And who in society do you want respect from ? If you want respect from hip-hop rappers , then get some gold teeth , grab your crotch liberally , and wear pants that are falling to your knees . If you want respect from slimy salesmen , go work at a car dealership and make the most bonus of any person that week ... .Do you want respect from people in the local church ? That works great until you disagree with one of their beleifs ... ... ... The most important thing is that you become a person who respects himself -- regardless of others . That is truly of value . If you are looking for respect as a commodity , to be used as a tool for getting stuff from people , then I poo-poo it.So you need to define what qualities in yourself are worthy of respect .

"If the core of a nuclear plant went critical ( china syndrome ) would it actually melt it 's way to china ? This is prob a stupid question , I just saw the movie and I missed the explanation of the result of a china syndrome . All nuclear plants that are producing power must be `` critical . '' The plant is shut down when it is `` subcritical . '' A nuclear accident can occur if the reactor goes `` supercritical . '' A supercritical plant can release uncontrolled heat drying the core and melting it . A melted core would fall by gravity toward the center of the world ( like anything else that falls ) . Since Canton OH was almost directly opposite Canton China on the globe , the core would fall toward China , thus the China syndrome . Of course the core would have to melt its way past the plant barriers but would not release enough energy to reach China let alone deeply penetrate the earth . For those with a wild imagination , China would also be protected by the massive molten layer in the center of the earth that surrounds the extremely hard metal core . None-the-less , China Syndrome is a catchy phrase .",0
"Problems with a relationship ? I 'm in my mid twenty 's and dating a guy twenty years older than me and he had said he really cared for me and then all the sudden he said it was n't working . But the next day he 's ready to try again and start all over . What would you do about that . The answer by vanessitacool is right on the money . This is a straight forward situation where you really need to walk away . But based on the background in your question , I sense that you may have a little trouble understanding why . So I will offer a little bit more.Consider that you may be only hearing what you want to hear . The fact that he said that he 'cared for you ' and that 'it was n't working ' . Sound contradictory when taken as sentence fragments , but in reality they are part of a much bigger communication context . I suspect that if you did n't just listen for what you want to hear , the message would sound alot more clear cut.Also when he says that he is ready to try again and start over , that may just be driven by some alterior motive ( sex ) . Men will say/do almost anything for that , and given that he is much older it is very conceivable that he is well versed in maniuplating younger more impressionable and vulnerable women.Do n't be a victim of these games .

"What is the meaning of the English soccer term `` cup-tied '' when applied to an individual player ? Cup-tied is an adjective , used primarily in football ( soccer ) , used to describe a player who is ineligible to play in a knockout cup competition after transferring from another club during that competition.In virtually all domestic and international cup competitions , any player who makes an appearance for a club at any stage of the competition is `` tied '' to that club for all future matches during that season in the same competition . This prevents a strong team from gaining an unfair advantage by signing a talented player from a club that has lost in an earlier round . A team that wishes to transfer a player may deliberately choose to keep that player off its cup roster to ensure that he is not cup-tied , increasing his usefulness to a club that may be involved in the same competition . A recent example of this was Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez ' decision to keep Milan Baroš off Liverpool 's roster for their 2005-06 UEFA Champions League ties in order to retain his value to clubs interested in purchasing the Czech striker 's services . ( Baroš eventually moved to Aston Villa , which was not involved in the Champions League . ) Similarly , although far less often , a team may deliberately cup-tie a player to discourage a transfer during that season . Note , however , that this does not restrict most international transfers ; cup-tying is only an issue internationally if both teams involved in the transfer have participated in a continental cup competition such as the UEFA Champions League or UEFA Cup .",0

"What is the best AMD64 CPU for multitasker/gamer ? among athlon , athlon x2 , opteron , opteron x2 . price range 400 and under . I highly recommend the Athlon 64 X2 3800+ dual core processor if you are thinking of multitasking . Each core is based pretty much on the Venice core , and has 512 KB L2 cache . Each core runs at 2.0GHz , which is the same speed as the 90 nanometer process Athlon 64 3200+.For about the same price , the best single core processor is the Athlon 64 4000+ , with the San Diego core . It has 1MB of L2 cache . This is likely a better gaming processor than the X2 3800+ , because it has has a 400MHz speed advantage in one thread . It also has a 1MB L2 cache.Currently , all mainstream games are single threaded , meaning that they ca n't utilize the capabilities that dual core processors have . The dual core processor will perform very nicely in the environment of your operating system , but it wo n't have an advantage in gaming . Most people predict that multi-threaded PC games will become more common in the next few years , but there is a good chance they will do nicely on older single threaded systems at lower speeds.When it comes to games , your graphics card is far more important than the speed of your processor . Normal multitasking benefits most from the processor.Overall , I would recommend the Athlon 64 X2 3800+ .",0

"IF the owner of a home is deceased and you are willed the property , is the property automatically paid for ? Well , if the house still has a mortgage , you will only own the part that is already paid . Say , the house is worth 300k , but there is only 200k left on the mortgage . You will only own the 100k that was already paid for . However , before you jump on it , you will still be liable for everything that comes with the house . All , the liens , pending cases , all taxes , all settlements that are currently being paid , all workers that have worked on the house but have not been paid yet , etc etc . So , after you do the paperworks and assume the position of the new owner , everything related to the house is yours . I dont see a problem , but do consult a lawyer to have him dig up everything on the house . I mean , if its left to you , you will not be liable for anything against the house unless your name is on the deed . Because someone leaves something to you and now you owe because someone is suing the owner of the house for 2 million . How is that fair ?

"why is the risk of semen-to-mouth transmission less than semen-to-vagina ? Risk of HIV transmission from semen to vagina is supposed to be because of vaginal mucus membrane absorbing the virus . Mouth surface is also mucus membrane . So why risk of semen-to-mouth transmission is less than semen-to-vagina ? OK , ignoring the overly-emotional responses that some people have had to this question , it actually IS true that semen-to-mouth sex carries less of a risk of HIV transmission than semen-to-vagina . One caveat , though : The risk is NOT zero . Oral sex DOES carry a risk . Smaller , but a risk.Why ? No one has 100 % figured out . However , it is postulated that the digestive enzymes present in the saliva do a number on the HIV virus and are able to knock out a fair amount of the infectious little buggers . The vaginal secretions do n't contain these enzymes.So , no , our youth are NOT being lied to .",0

"how to treat plantar faciitis ? There are several things you can try.Anti-inflammatory medications like Ibuprofen or Naproxen may be helpful , taken with food.Fill an empty soda bottle with water and freeze . With a sock on , roll your heel over the ice bottle for 10-15 minutes , 3-4 times a day.NEVER go barefoot ! NOt even to the bathroom in the middle of the night . Always have good supportive shoes on.Stretching your calf muscle may help , particularly if you have a tight achilles to begin with . Face a wall , and place your plans on it . With the affected leg further behind you , lean into the wall , keeping your back leg straight and the heel on the floor . Then stretch with your knee slightly bent.If these methods do n't work , see your health care provider . A stronger anti-inflammatory medicine may be prescribed , he or she may evaluate you for orthotics , or supports that go into your shoes .

hair products and skin prouducts ? wat r the best hair products 2 use 2 get my hair thick again its already long and wat about skin i have some littelblack dots from bumps and i need them 2 go way and dont like proactive As far as skin goes : Try the Mary Kay skin care line with customized skin care products for acne . The best thing to with your skin is always to keep it clean as well as treating breakouts . This helps prevent breakouts . There are five steps to basic skin care : 1 . Cleanse2 . Exfoliate3 . Tone/Freshen4 . Moisturize5 . ProtectThe Mary Kay 3 in 1 cleanser can do the first three steps in one . The fifth step is protect . You want to use an oil free foundation which our formulas for dry normal combo and oily skin are all oil free . When your skin is protected with foundation you can wash off the impurities that your skin catches in the air . The foundation catches the irritants and impurities instead of them getting into your pores causing further breakouts . Mary Kay is satisfaction guaranteed . So if you try it and it doesnt work for you you can get different products or your money back . Also it is so important that when you are using skin care you use one line be it Mary Kay or Avon or a Walmart brand . They are formulated to work with one another . Mixing products not designed to work together can cause reactions in some people . ; ) To even out skin tone you of course need to keep your skin exfoliated but also use a solution like our day and night solution . The day solution has SPF 25 in it and the Night Solution has Vitamin A and E and more in them . These collagen inducing products help to tighten and firm the skin as well as even out tone . You can add in our Microdermabrasion once or twice a week to totally exfoliate and remove dead skin . The second step of our microderm set will return your skin to its proper PH balance so you will not be rough or dry afterwards . I reccomend using products as follows but all skin care must be customized for an individual.Timewise 3 in 1 Cleanser ( customized for skin type ) Timewise Day Solution ( at night use Night Solution ) Timewise Moisturizer ( customized for skin type ) Timewise Firming Eye creamAdditional moisturizers if needed ( intense for dry spots etc ) Foundation ( customized for skin type and shade ) Color products ( use all oil free and non-comedogenic ) Hope this was helpful ! !

"What features did a medieval castle have ? Stone , mortar , wood-these were the simple components used to construct some of the most heavily fortified structures ever created.Early castles relied on the surrounding landscape to provide much of the protection . Early castles were made of wood and built on hills of `` mottes '' . Surrounded by a high , wooden palisade , motte and bailey castles were used widely until the Norman invasion of 1066 . These fortifications proved too easy to burn , and stone was then used more frequently.Castles were rarely the most comfortable place to live , with only the lord and his family given adequate heat and other amenities . Medieval castles were built for safety , not comfort . Windows were little more than slits in the wall . Cold , stone floors and walls rarely kept in heat , and water had to be brought by the bucketful throughout the castle . Walls were built high to protect from advancing armies , and to provide needed lookout positions.For detailed information , visit : http : //www.medieval-castles.net/castle_architecture/index.htmThe simple stone and mortar architecture made repairs fairly easy to make . It was not uncommon for stones to be used over and over with each successive castle built on the same location . Cannons and gunpowder made the castle ineffective and these large structures evolved in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance to become manor homes and palaces .",0

My favorite class was a college class called The Short Fiction of Franz Kafka . It was discussion based , 3 hours long , and once a week . It was amazing how much I learned in that format . First off ... ... .I am such a language/English/literature person . But in college I had to take a statistics class . I was scared to death because I just so do n't have a mathematical mind . I loved it ! The teacher was amazing ... ... and related to each of us on such a personal level . The hilarious part was that it was one of those huge lecture type classes with over 200 people . Yet , she had this way of making it seem like she was talking straight to you . We would all be working problems and laughing and poking fun at our silly mistakes instead of feeling like we were losers for screwing up . Her tests were monstrously hard , but I ended up with an `` A '' in the course . Shows you what amazing teaching skills mixed with personable skills can do for students .

"i need to know what plants mean for a school project. ? example : laurel wreaths symbolize victory . i need an answer soon ! ASAP ! ! ! Need an answer for your project before monday ? Its not a good idea to leave stuff like that for the last minute.Flowers have been irresitible to painters through the ages . These days we 've lost much of the symbolism associated with them , but earlier painters chose flowers to convey very specific messages about their subjects . The meaning associated with a specific flower differs between cultures ; the symbolism for each given here is from Western European culture unless specified otherwise.Bamboo : A symbol for longevity ( it 's always got green shoots ) as well as strength and grace ( it bends readily but does n't break easily ) .

"I just bought my nephews a used stereo microscope ( AO 570 , 7x to 42x power ) . What are some fun things to view ? They are wanting a telescope , but at their age ( 10 and 11 ) , I thought they might have more fun looking at various things under a microscope . This scope has an excellent light ( 48 LED circle ) and the lenses are perfectly clear.I 'm afraid , though , that they might get bored pretty quickly if I do n't think of some things to have ready for them to look at . A coin at 42x is interesting , and so is a fly , but I need a LOT more things lined up if you have any suggestions . Wanting them to see things under the scope that they would never know about , even if it is `` everyday '' things.Thanks . Do n't forget that your samples must be small and THIN ( flat ) . If the sample is too big/thick then no light will pass through to the lenses.Most things are best viewed after mounting them in a drop of water under a cover slip.1 . Crystals of salt , icing sugar , etc.2 . Fibres of cotton , wool , synthetics , string , etc.3 . The torn edges of paper.4 . The individual dots of colour from non-glossy pictures . You will probably have to add a bit more illumination from above the sample for this by shining a light onto it ( e.g . desk light ) .5 . Leaf 'skeletons'.6 . Living leaves - from a potted plant ( e.g . a 'spider plant ' ) bend the leaf and clip it between two slides . ( Additional top illumination needed. ) 7 . The thin 'skin ' from between the 'leaves ' of an onion ( onion epidermis ) .8 . The edge of a razor blade or sharp knife ( with top illumination ) .9 . Strands of spider webs.10 . Dust.11 . By gently using a potato peeler you can make thin sections of all sorts of plant parts . Usually only the very edges of these sections are suitable for viewing . You might like to stain plant samples with a drop of iodine ( use instead of water ) under the cover slip.12 . If you have a wood-plane then make thin samples of different types of wood. ( P.S . Forgive my UK spelling )",0

"Where did the term `` I 'll be there with bells on '' originate ? I seem to remember reading somewhere that in the old sled/carriage days that if a fellow teamster had to bail you out of trouble , you traditionally gave them your sleighbells as a thank you ( or mark of shame ? ) . Ca n't find that reference any more . Direct quote from http : //www.rootsweb.com/~genepool/meanings.htm : `` To be somewhere with `` bells on '' refers to a practice peddlers had when they roamed the area west of the Appalachians selling wares . To avoid Indians , they traveled as silently as possible until they reached a settled area . Then they unmuffled bells hung around their horses necks to announce their arrival to outlying cabins . Hence , `` I 'll be there with bells on . '' The peddlers ' arrival was a much anticipated major event in the mostly tedious and hard lives of settlers , not only for the goods they sold , but also for the news , letters , and messages they carried from the outside world .

"Why does metal spark in the microwave ? The short answer is : Microwaves bombard the metal with radio waves ( electrons ) . Where that energy builds up , it can build to the point the energy will arc to another spot . Works great with crumpled foil , or CD-ROM 's you do n't want to use anymore . Quoth Wikipedia : `` ... the pointed ends of the fork will act to concentrate the electric field formed at the tips . This has the effect of exceeding the dielectric breakdown gradient of air , about 3 megavolts per meter ( 3×106V/m ) , causing sparks to form . This effect is directly analogous to the effect of St. Elmo 's fire. '' P.S . According to Mythbusters , you CAN NOT damage your microwave by putting metal objects in it for short periods of time . You would have to microwave metal a LOT for it to overload the magnetron and cause damage ( most magnetrons in consumer microwaves have overload protection anyway ) . Try microwaving a CD you do n't need anymore upside-down in your microwave for 2-5 seconds , and watch the miracle of radio lithography ( just do n't do it to the point the plastic melts , or who knows what kind of toxic fumes you might release from the plastic ) .",0

"Why do people think that witchcraft is bad ? and will harry potter books really make u perfom witchcraft ? I love harry potter books without them i wouldnt read as much as i do Just because you read a book about harry potter does n't mean you 're going to want to perform witchcraft .

"where do bugs go when the weather changes ? Many kinds of bugs only live a year and then die off because either their food requirements can not be filled or because they are susceptible to freezing . Many other species survive cold weather through a process called diapause . Diapause is a state insects enter into prior to unfavorable conditions becoming evident . At this time they become inactive and do not feed or reproduce , thereby using very little energy . They can remain in this condition until favorable weather returns .",0
"why do people jude by the way u look or act ? You 've heard of `` making a good first impression '' ? When you meet someone for the first time , visual cues are all you have to evaluate each other .

At this point , any judgement made is only opinion and human nature.Everyone judges everyone else ; a person who says otherwise is n't being honest . It has nothing to do with being shallow , being a sinner , etc . Everyone does it ! Some are able to overcome this initial prejudice and learn what 's in another 's heart ; others ca n't , or won't.If your behavior is n't outrageous , and you 're generally a good person , do n't worry about what others think .

"If a man is kept in a sealed chamber and the pressure is increased slowly and constantly , would he implode ? I think not so , since increasing the pressure constantly would also raise his internal pressure . But the question is , HOW much pressure ?

"Can a state to state relationship turn in to a life long relationship together. ? Yes , it can . It depends on how hard you work at it , and how much they are working at it . You have to keep your commitments of calling when you promise , being on line when you promise , of coming down when you promise , and vice versa . Sometimes starting out in long distance relationships actually make them better . One reason is that you know from the beginning it is going to take work and are ready to take that on . Second , you learn to communicate verbally with each other on every topic , and that will last through your relationship if it leads to marriage . Also , it forces you to take things slow , and really get to know the person over time . Sometimes if we can see the person every day , we fall too fast , and fail to recognize the warning signs that we would see if there were some distance put between us . I know of a couple that dated from Scotland to Canada for two years , and just got married . You know what ? They would n't have traded the past two years for anything , because now they talk to each other every day about everything , and it has taught them a lot about confiding in each other and trusting in each other . I hope it works out for you . : )",0

"what is pollination ? pollination , transfer of pollen from the male reproductive organ ( stamen or staminate cone ) to the female reproductive organ ( pistil or pistillate cone ) of the same or of another flower or cone . Pollination is not to be confused with fertilization , which it may precede by some time—a full season in many conifers . The most common agents of pollination are flying insects ( as in most flowering plants ) and the wind ( as in many trees and all grasses and conifers ) , but crawling and hopping insects , snails , bats , primates , rodents , and hummingbirds may also serve . The devices that operate to ensure cross-pollination and prevent self-pollination ( see sex ) are varied and sometimes extremely intricate . Among them are different maturation times for the pollen and eggs of the same flower or plant , separate staminate and pistillate flowers on the same or on different plants , chemical properties that make the pollen and eggs of the same plant sterile to each other , and specialized mechanisms or structural arrangements that prevent the pollinating agent from transferring the pollen of a flower to its own stigma . In the lady's-slipper the bee enters the nectar-filled pouch by one opening and must leave by another ; in so doing it brushes first past the stigma , which scrapes pollen off its back , and then past the stamens , which deposit another load of pollen . The stamens of the mountain laurel are bent back and held like springs by notches in the petals ; when the bee alights it contacts the tall pistil and then , in probing deeper for nectar , triggers the stamens . Pollen is catapulted onto the insect 's underside , ready for contact with the next pistil . Other examples of floral adaptations to their pollinating agents are the fig and its wasp and the yucca and its moth . Wind pollination , depending as it does on statistical chance for successful pollination , requires vast quantities of pollen , which may be forcefully ejected by the anther sac ( as in grasses and ragweed ) or may be exposed ( as in cones and catkins ) to the slightest breeze .

"over 200 years ago what did Carolus Linnaeus classify living things on ? Taxonomy . In his major work Systema Naturae ( The System of Nature ) , first published in 1735 , Linnaeus devised a system of classification of organisms that is still in use today . This system places living things within increasingly specific categories based on common attributes—from a general grouping ( kingdom ) down to the specific individual ( species ) . Using this system , Linnaeus named nearly 10,000 plant and animal species in his lifetime . Not an evolutionist by any means , Linnaeus believed that each species was created by God and was incapable of change . Nevertheless , his orderly groupings of living things provided important insights for later theorists .",0

"what do high heel shoes do to your posture ? i saw it on CSI it does something really bad but i forgot what High heels do WONDERS for your posture ! The heel is actually used by many women to force them to stand taller , straighter , and with their shoulders back . They also shape the calves nicely.Having said that , I think what you meant to ask was whether or not high heels are bad for the body in general , and the answer to this is yes . Your knee joints suffer when you wear heels and they 're not great for your back either . In the long run , I suppose this might hurt your posture , but not immediatly .",0
"do boys prefer tom boys or girly girls ? Many of my guy friends find it hard to like me because I 'm a super tom boy - but that does n't mean they 're not attracted to you - a few of my guy friends have told me that it 's not because i 'm not attractive , it 's because they 're afraid to like a tom boy , that they 'd get rejected , that she 's not interested in a relationship because she 's more interested in her own life , her interests , her friends.It could also be her confidence and aggressiveness that scares a guy away . I personally just think guys who wo n't approach a tom boy because she 's comfortable of being herself are scared , insecure guys who look for girly girls because of the need it gives them to 'protect ' her.Not all , but most , I 'd think . I 'm a tomboy ... but I 've met a guy who 's not afraid to love me just because I 'm different .",0
"What is the wicca religon ? I have always wondered . Wicca is a Neopagan religious movement found in many different countries , though most commonly in English-speaking cultures . Wicca was first publicised in 1954 after the repeal of the British Witchcraft Act , by a British civil servant named Gerald Gardner . He claimed that the religion , of which he was an initiate , was a modern survival of an old witch cult , which had existed in secret for hundreds of years , originating in the pre-Christian Paganism of Europe . Wicca is thus sometimes referred to as the Old Religion . The veracity of Gardner 's claims is now much debated , and it is thought that much if not all of Wiccan theology was established no earlier than the 1920s . Since its founding , various related Wiccan traditions have evolved , or been adapted from , the form established by Gardner , which came to be called Gardnerian Wicca . These other traditions of Wicca each have specific beliefs , rituals , and practices . Most traditions of Wicca remain secretive and require members to be initiated , however there is a growing movement of Eclectic or Solitary Wiccans who adhere to the religion but do not believe a traditional initiation is necessary . Gardnerian Wicca is perhaps the most popular of the traditions excepting Solitary Wicca . you can find more information also in the address that i give you",0

"Why did the German government introduce Submarine warfare ? NO SPAM PLZ ! I presume you mean `` unrestricted '' submarine warfare.The short answer was to win the war . A better answer was because the English blockade of of Germany had the effect of starving the German populace of both food and resources.During WW1 , the British Navy was the most powerful force in the world . The German surface Navy could not hope to be an effective counter to it , so Germany had to resort to tactics other than traditional surface conflict . Submarines or Unterseebooten ( U-Boats ) were one means employed by the Germans . U-Boats were the `` Stealth Bombers '' of thier day . They could sneak up on surface ships undetected , and sink them with torpedoes.Germany 's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was originally instituted to combat the overwhelming superiority of the English Navy , but when they started sinking un-armed vessels with other nations peoples on board ( specifically Americans ) this helped draw America into the war . When the American 's arrived , it tipped the balance in favor of the allies ultimately losing the war for Germany .",0

"Is salvation for the jews only ? According to Judaism , all the righteous in the world , Jewish or not , have their portion in the world to come.First and foremost , Jews believe strongly in the concept of Chasedei Umos Haolam ( lit . Righteous People of the Nations of the World ) that they are abundantly and lavishly rewarded for their good deeds . So , according to the jewish view , salvation is truly for every good-doer or do-gooder in the world , regardless of faith or heritage.However , for a more in depth discussion , this question is quite tricky . First and foremost , the term `` salvation '' or in hebrew , Yeshua , does not relate to personal salvation , heaven or hell etc.It is not an individualistic concept , but is more specifically used in reference to deliverance from exile , a future messianic era where moshiach , lit . meaning `` an anointed one '' , will bring peace to the world and lead the entire jewish nation to congregate in israel at the future third temple . While there is no temple , the jews are considered a scattered people . This future period is a time of peace for everyone . It is not exclusionary . The world will presumably be business as usual . But people , enlightened by a high ethical and moral understanding , will get along better with each other . And war and strife and fear will not be a staple of daily life ( as they are now , during this period of exile ) . Thus it will be a time of deliverance from persecution and plague for everyone alike.As for going to heaven vs. hell , judaism teaches us not to focus our energies on this aspect of existence so that we do n't constantly think about getting rewarded ( see ethics of our fathers ) . And rather do good deeds for the sake of doing good deeds.All in all , according to judaism , if you 're a good person , you 're going to heaven !",0

"What does it mean when people say they have high metabolism ? When someone has a high metabolism that means they have the ability to burn calories quickly . People who are more active have the ability to burn more calories . Those who are sedentary tend to have a lower metabolism . When your body is active , it is always prepared to burn your calories . When your body is not used to physical exertion it essentially has to `` wake up '' to start burning calories .",0

"Can diffusion take place in solids ? Yes.Orthoclase feldspar is an example . At high temperatures , Fe will fit into the orthoclase lattice . As temperature drops , the lattice shrinks so that Fe no longer fits . Fe diffuses out of the latice and accumulates along the planes between orthoclase crystal twins . Along the way , it grabs O to produce Fe2O3 . If you look closely at pink granite , usually you will see that the pink grains are actually white and red striped . Those grains are orthoclase crystals with exsolved hematite along twin planes.Exsolution and diffusion of Fe from orthoclase can only occur at high temperature . If the orthoclase cools too quickly for the Fe to diffuse out , it will remain in the orthoclase lattice , which will be distorted to accomodate the larger ( larger than K ) Fe ion.Material science is not boring .",0

"can antigravity be achieved ? Anti-gravity in the context of mainstream physicsNewton 's Law of Gravitation considered gravity to be a force between two objects , causing attraction in proportion to the objects ' mass . Under this interpretation , an object with negative mass would repel ordinary matter , and could be used to produce an anti-gravity effect . Alternatively , depending on the mechanism assumed to underlie the gravitational force , it may seem reasonable to postulate a material that shields against gravity or otherwise interferes with the force . An example of such a material , cavorite , is a major deus ex machina of H. G. Wells ' famous book , The First Men in the Moon , though it should be noted that Cavorite is n't consistent with even a Newtonian view of the universe ( it causes violations of conservation laws ) . Neither negative-mass exotic matter nor a gravity-screening material have been observed experimentally . While the potential existence of exotic matter is still debated , general relativity presents persuasive arguments against the existence of screening materials . Einstein 's theory of general relativity , published in 1915 , supplanted Newton 's model of gravity with an entirely different mechanism - one based entirely on the geometry of the universe . Gravity was no longer a force at all , but simply the consequence of the local slope of the universe in a direction the human eye can not see : time . You stick to the floor not because gravity is pulling you down , but because that is the shortest distance between today and tomorrow . Under this model , gravity in a universe containing only matter with positive mass is purely attractive . No arrangement of ordinary matter can produce an anti-gravity effect . Spacetime geometries corresponding to true anti-gravity in general relativity require negative mass . Some models of anti-gravity claim to derive from general relativity.The model of gravity proposed by the theory of general relativity breaks down under extreme conditions ( too far inside a black hole , and in the very early life of the universe under the big bang model ) . In particular , most physicists believe that at extremely high energies , gravity and the other fundamental forces unify , which would allow gravity to be manipulated in ways that are not readily apparent now . Candidate models for this regime are theories of everything , which attempt to model all four forces ( example : string theory ) , and theories of quantum gravity , which attempt to produce a model of gravity that is consistent with quantum mechanics , though not necessarily unified with the other forces . Some models of anti-gravity claim to be based on quantum gravity models , though the connection of these to mainstream quantum gravity models is often tenuous.Conventional effects that look like anti-gravityMagnetic levitation suspends an object against gravity by use of electromagnetic effects . While visually impressive , this is not an anti-gravity effect . Critics of various alleged anti-gravity devices often suggest that unusual effects observed around them are due to electromagnetism.A tidal force causes objects to move along diverging paths near a massive body ( such as a planet or star ) , producing effects that seem like repulsion or disruptive forces when observed locally . This is not anti-gravity . In Newtonian mechanics , the tidal force is the effect of the larger object 's gravitational force being different at the differing locations of the diverging bodies . In Einsteinian gravity , the tidal force is the effect of the diverging bodies following different paths in the negatively curved spacetime around the larger body . Large amounts of normal matter can be used to produce a gravitational field that compensates for the effects of another gravitational field , though the entire assembly will still be attracted to the source of the larger field . Physicist Robert L. Forward proposed using lumps of degenerate matter to locally compensate for th",0
"why is there no light in space ? There is light in space . After all , the light we see on Earth from the Sun , the moon , and the stars travels through space to get here . The big difference between Earth and space is that our atmosphere reflects the light that goes through it . So it makes our surroundings seem brighter . Since space does n't hold an atmosphere there is nothing to reflect the light and it just passes through.So basically light is always travelling through space but it does n't get reflected ( which makes it dark ) .Hope that makes some sense .",0

"i am an undergraduate seeking for admission into any of the universities ? there are two main ways of getting into a university . the first is to apply directly to a `` four year university '' . in order to get into one of these directly you will need to turn in SAT scores from highschool , along with your highschool transcripts . getting into a university this way is more competitive and it will be harder to get in when compared to the second way . the second way to get into a four year university is to first go to a `` community college '' . at community colleges you will normally do all of the `` general education '' classes that you would have taken anyway at the university during your first two years . once you have finished your G.E ( general education ) you can then apply to `` transfer '' into a four year university having already finished the G.E requirements . if you follow this way you will not need to turn in SAT scores or highschool transcripts and it will be easier to get into a university . aside from it being easier , it is also cheaper to go first to a community college since they are cheaper and will provide you with the same credits that you will be doing during your first two years at a university .",0

"Where are my virgins at ? Anyone choosing not to have sex these days ? Any thoughts ? Well I am a 17 year old abstinent girl , and there are n't many people out there choosing not to have sex . Where did all the virgins go ? ? What are your thoughts on being abstinent ? Hi there , I know that the pressure of being a virgin is extremely hard for one to handle , especially in the Western societies that we live in ; but virginity is worth striking for . I 'm in my 20s and the group of friends that I have is also in their 20s and we are all virgins . I think the most important thing that one needs to keep in mind is that virginity is for ONESELF , not for anyone else ( or sometimes you might wan na save it for you future husband ) . Once you are determined about it , it would be less difficult when you think of whether to have sex or not . My friends and I choose not to have sex before marriage b/c we see SEX as LOVE , and we respect our body as well as our partners ' . When you love someone unconditionally , you do n't just want to own the physical body , do you ? ? Moreoever , when one has premarital sex , the wedding is not something that precious and special anymore , do n't you think ? ? ? What is it special about the wedding night if you 've already know everything about the other person ? ? ? I also have friends who had sex in their teen years and most of them regreted later on .

"Should the Phil . invest money donated by western countrries on developing on agri . area 's into industr'l zone ? *Economic Impact*Social and physiological needs*psychological impact*Advantage and disadvantage Investing money to develop agricultural areas into industrial zones is good -- -partly though.First of all , the Philippines is an agricultural nation . Perhaps some agricultural areas should be developed , but not all . Since it is an agricultural nation , it derives its economy from agriculture . If these areas will be developed into industrial zones , a good part of the economy will be crippled.Second , people who depend on agriculture for a living will lost their jobs . If their skills are only limited to agriculture , where will they go once these areas are industrialized ? Lastly , and this is just my opinion , if agricultural areas will be turned into industrial zones , and considering that the money comes from Western countries , the Philippines will then have a debt of gratitude to these nations . Meaning , its government will do whatever these nations will tell them to do . Another form of colonization , eh ?

"what is biodiesel ? Biodiesel is a fuel that is made from either waste oil ( collected from restaurants ) or pure vegetable oil . It is often mixed with `` regular '' diesel . You can buy it at some gas stations , although it is n't common . The ratio of biodiesel to regular diesel varies depending on the vehicle and the season ( less biodiesel in the winter , for example ) . The benefits of biodiesel include lessening our dependence on foreign oil , increasing our use of renewable resources , especially those that are produced in our own country , and cleaner fuel both in use and in production . The US government 's standards for regular diesel are not as stringent as they are in other countries , although that will change in the next year or so . Right now , there are few American automakers who produce diesel passenger vehicles . You 'll find diesel trucks , but I do n't think there are any American made cars . This may change as the quality of diesel improves and as biodiesel becomes more readily available.Biodiesel is fairly easy to make . There are a lot of `` home brewers '' out there who collect waste oil from restaurants , filter it as necessary , and process it into biodiesel . My boss makes it in our shop and we use it in our company vehicles . Except for the occasional nasty smelling batch of cooking oil , it 's great . We 're greatly reducing our company 's fuel costs because the diesel vehicles have much better gas mileage , and we 're producing the biodiesel for less than $ 1.25 per gallon .",0

"Is there a recursive algorithm that generates all the permutations of a given string ? Here 's a java solution that uses recursion . The permute function takes two arguments : a done portion and a todo portion . The basic idea is that each of the characters in the todo portion could be the next character . So , at each step , n recursive calls are made , where n is the length of todo . Each call chooses a different character as the next character to go into the done portion . So , the first time the number of recursive calls will equal the number of characters in the initial string . Each of these calls will make further recursive calls equal to the number of characters in the initial string minus one . And so on . Thus , the number of solutions will be n ! = n*n-1*n-2* ... *1 , where n is the number of characters in the initial string.The program below was tested with java 's sun compiler 1.4.2.public class perm { public perm ( String S ) { permute ( `` '' , S ) ; } public void permute ( String done , String todo ) { if ( ( todo.length ( ) ==0 ) || ( todo.equals ( `` '' ) ) ) System.out.println ( done ) ; else { for ( int i=0 ; i < todo.length ( ) ; i++ ) { String c = todo.substring ( 0,1 ) ; todo = todo.substring ( 1 ) ; permute ( done+c , todo ) ; todo = todo + c ; } } } public static void main ( String args [ ] ) { if ( ( args.length==0 ) || ( args [ 0 ] .length ( ) ==0 ) || ( args [ 0 ] .equals ( `` '' ) ) ) return ; perm p = new perm ( args [ 0 ] ) ; } }",0

"What is the theory of relativity ? I have gotten mixed information on this subject , and would like to know the truth . Any resources would be great . Wellrelativity Physical theory , introduced by Albert Einstein , that discards the concept of absolute motion and instead treats only relative motion between two systems or frames of reference . One consequence of the theory is that space and time are no longer viewed as separate , independent entities but rather are seen to form a four-dimensional continuum called space-time . Full comprehension of the mathematical formulation of the theory can be attained only through a study of certain branches of mathematics , e.g. , tensor calculus . Both the special and general theories have been established and accepted into the structure of physics . Einstein also sought unsuccessfully for many years to incorporate the theory into a unified field theory valid also for subatomic and electromagnetic phenomena.Evolution from Classical TheoryThe modern theory is an extension of the simpler Galilean or Newtonian concept of relativity , which holds that the laws of mechanics are the same in one system as in another system in uniform motion relative to it . Thus , it is impossible to detect the motion of a system by measurements made within the system , and such motion can be observed only in relation to other systems in uniform motion . The older concept of relativity assumes that space and time are correctly measured separately and regards them as absolute and independent realities . The system of relativity and mechanics of Galileo and Newton is perfectly self-consistent , but the addition of Maxwell 's theory of electricity and magnetism to the system leads to fundamental theoretical difficulties related to the problem of absolute motion .",0

Just when life could n't get any better , he decided that God was telling him to go back to his ex who treats him like crud . The joy was indescribable , but so is the pain ... and honestly , even moreso . I do n't think the chance of true love is worth the pain of rejection . How does one protect themselves from pain of this sort without isolating everyone and turning into the lonliest person in the world ? The pain of rejection is temporary . You feel it now because the wound is fresh . But wounds always get better with time . However bad it has been losing this guy for you , you will surely get over it . Because , pain is always temporary.Whereas , the joy of true love , when you do find it , is permanent . It is an eternal paradise . You have already had a glimpse of it . Just imagine how wonderful it would be if such a joy lasted forever . So dont think the pain is not worth bearing . It is . Not just once or twice but as many times it takes . Never lose faith in true love . Just because one person struck hollow , doesnt mean every other guy will . The only way to be happy is to believe that there is good and happiness and it is attainable.There is no way you can protect yourself from this sort of pain . It is a part of life . But so is the happiness . Someday it will be yours . All you have to do is hang in there , especially during the delicates moments like the ones you 're going through now . Dont lose hope.. the world is a beautiful garden with many wonderful flowers.You 'll find your rose . Time is all it takes .",0

"i want information on VLSI systems or paper on it. ? i want to present paper on VLSI systems . Very-large-scale integration ( VLSI ) of systems of transistor-based circuits into integrated circuits on a single chip first occurred in the 1980s as part of the semiconductor and communication technologies that were being developed.The first semiconductor chips held one transistor each . Subsequent advances added more and more transistors , and as a consequence more individual functions or systems were integrated over time . The microprocessor is a VLSI device.The first `` generation '' of computers relied on vacuum tubes . Then came discrete semiconductor devices , followed by integrated circuits . The first Small-Scale Integration ( SSI ) ICs had small numbers of devices on a single chip – diodes , transistors , resistors and capacitors ( no inductors though ) , making it possible to fabricate one or more logic gates on a single device . The fourth generation consisted of Large-Scale Integration ( LSI ) , i.e . systems with at least a thousand logic gates . The natural successor to LSI was VLSI ( many tens of thousands of gates on a single chip ) . Current technology has moved far past this mark and today 's microprocessors have many millions of gates and hundreds of millions of individual transistors.As of mid-2004 , billion-transistor processors are not yet economically feasible for most uses , but they are achievable in laboratory settings , and they are clearly on the horizon as semiconductor fabrication moves from the current generation of 90 nanometer ( 90nm ) processes to the next 65nm and 45nm generations.At one time , there was an effort to name and calibrate various levels of large-scale integration above VLSI . Terms like Ultra-large-scale Integration ( ULSI ) were used . But the huge number of gates and transistors available on common devices has rendered such fine distinctions moot . Terms suggesting more-than-VLSI levels of integration are no longer in widespread use . Even VLSI is now somewhat quaint , given the common assumption that all microprocessors are VLSI or better .",0

Congressman Willard Duncan Vandiver , who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1897 to 1903 . While a member of the U.S. House Committee on Naval Affairs , Vandiver attended an 1899 naval banquet in Philadelphia . In a speech there , he declared , `` I come from a state that raises corn and cotton and cockleburs and Democrats , and frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me . I am from Missouri . You have got to show me . '' Regardless of whether Vandiver coined the phrase , it is certain that his speech helped to popularize the saying .",0

"What does sexual side effect mean ? Personal Side Effectsof StatinsImpotence , Loss of Libido and Erectile Dysfunction The pharmaceutical industry would lead us to believe that rapidly bottoming out our natural cholesterol levels through the use of their highly touted statin drugs is a relatively innocuous process of definite benefit to society . But as we learn more each day of this ubiquitous and unique cholesterol substance , we must question the veracity of their medical advisors . Cholesterol is perhaps the most important substance in our lives for we could not live without an abundant supply of it in our bodies . Researchers everywhere are learning how extraordinarily complex and often surprising are the pathways that produce and metabolize cholesterol . Cholesterol is the precursor for a whole class of hormones known as the steroid hormones that are absolutely critical for life , as we know it . These hormones determine our sexuality , control the reproductive process , and regulate blood sugar levels and mineral metabolism . This same substance that society has been taught to fear happens to be our sole source for our hormones , androgen , estrogen and progesterone .",0

"More Question to Muslim ? I am sorry this is just for My Knowladge.I do n't mean to provoke anything.Thank for a good answer.==========================What is women in Islam think about poligamy . I made some studies in Modern Muslim country it look like they do n't like poligamy.At what age Muhammad married Aishah ( Hope I am writting correctly ) and how many wife he have ? ? Why and what is the reason behind that . Dear SellCar , i really hope you got a good reason behind those questions , anyways ill answer your question.i read some strange answer above ; ( , so i hope i can make it clear Ofcourse every woman hates polygamy , God created woman to hate anyone that shares her love , but in Holy Quran it says and made it clear for men that they should not take more than one wife unless they have their reasons , like for example some wives dont have the ability to be pregnant , its no body 's fault of course but as a man everyone likes to be a father , therefore he can marry another wife.another reason for men might be that some men need more than one woman and he is not getting enough , therefore he could make sin with other woman which is bad for Islam teachings and social life and reputation , or he can marry another woman that will give him more pleasure and in the same time he is not making any sin.Moreover , if you now make a study you will find that number of men is much more less than number of women in the world , years ago in Germany they where surprised to find that 1 man is being borned for every 4 women ! ! for a reason that no one knows except God he knew that this will be the case , therefore he authorised to have more than wife , or else we will have more than half of the woman not married for the rest of their lives . ( speaking about Islam societies only , western countires men and woman stays with no marriage usually for the rest of their lives ) God authorised polygamy for more better reasons ofcourse , but i only know these.and of course there is no polygamy for men in Islam ; ) , because at that stage we cant know who is son or daughter of whom.and for a man being with a legal woman is ofcourse much better than being with a new woman everyday or month ; ( Islam makes a great social life by its teachings.============i really dont know the exact age of Muhammad ( PBUH ) when he married Aisha , but i think in 40's.God didnt authorise for muslims to marry more than four wives and in a certain conditions , but for messenger of God ( Muhmmad PBUH ) he authorised for him to marry more , i do know one reason now for this is that Mohammad ( PBUH ) wanted to make links with the arab tribes across arabia to spread Islam , and as a messenger of God marrying one of the women in a tribe it was a very good impression to make for those tribes , which later he made friendship with them and they followed Islam teachings , therefore marrying more than one wife helped the spread of Islam at that time , and it made for Islam a good base in Arabia .",0

Coined in the United States in the early 20th century , it has met with a blizzard of condemnation for being an improper yoking of irrespective and regardless and for the logical absurdity of combining the negative ir- prefix and -less suffix in a single term . Although one might reasonably argue that it is no different from words with redundant affixes like debone and unravel , it has been considered a blunder for decades and will probably continue to be so .",0

"Can `` any humanbeing '' can touch the stars ... ? Stars are massive , glowing balls of hot gases , mostly hydrogen and helium . Some stars are extremely hot , while others are cooler . You can tell by the color of light that the stars give off . If you look at the coals in a charcoal grill , you know that the red glowing coals are cooler than the white hot ones . The same is true for stars . A blue or white star is hotter than a yellow star , which is hotter than a red star . Temperature of stars range in the high hundreds to thousands degrees F. So to touch the stars that are in the sky is almost impossible , as your body would burn due to high temperatures surrounding them .",0

"Is there a dallas bias ? Do the Dallas Cowboys have a bias against them with the media in the rest of the country ? I do n't think that a bias necessarily exists within the media , but among fans I believe there sure are a lot of Cowboys haters . There are several reasons for this . For one , there is a little bit of jealousy for `` America 's Team '' . These feelings are still carrying over from their dynasty in the 90 's ( and even the 70s ) . Also , the organization has had many abrasive characters : owner Jerry Jones , the Tuna , ex-stars such as Michael Irvin , and the myriad of criminals and druggies they 've paraded through in the last 10/15 years . As with any great sports organization , fans are very polarized ... you either love 'em or hate 'em . I love 'em , but conversely I despise great competing teams such as the Steelers and 49ers . Some in the media may have their beef with Jerry Jones or other people in the organization , but I think the strong anti-Dallas emotion is mainly among the fans ( which is a tribute to the Cowboys being one of the top teams in the sport ) .",0

"What do about my boyfriend snoring ? My boyfriend is only 20 and his snoring is awful most nights . It keeps me awake and is frustrating . I know their are surgeries out there to fix it , and some say exercise helps . The nose strips and sprays do not work because it is coming from his throat , not his nose . He believes he has sleep apnea , but we do not have the money to test for this . Anyone else experience this and can reccomend a solution thayt worked for them ? Your boyfriend needs to seriously consider testing for sleep apnea , especially if the snoring seems to be throat-based . I 'll just bet he has it , too . Age is not a factor ; I am told kids as young as 12 can have it.I have it and did n't know it . For me , it was n't a snoring issue ; it was an issue with not getting a restful night 's sleep . I 'd wake up in the morning and feel completely exhausted.I was tested three years ago and was shocked to find out that I stopped breathing 30 times in three hours , which essentially woke me up . When the clinic stirred me , they put me on a CPAP ( controlled positive air pressure machine ) and I fell into deep REM sleep for the first time in I ca n't remember . Since then , I use the CPAP every night and sleep like a baby . You will , too.I ca n't stress enough the health implications of this beyond the lack of sleep . It is a severe drag on the heart and respiratory system.I ca n't speak to your financial issues , but medical insurance should cover this if your doctor makes the referral.According to my doctor , surgery has only a 35 % success rate .

"Explanation for correlated wave function collapse at a distance ( Quantum Mechanics ) ? I remember from physics class in college that two correlated wavefunctions ( e.g. , sum of wavefunction spins = 0 ) can exhibit strange behavior at a distance . left alone ( e.g. , without measurement of wavefunctions ) , each wavefunction ( called A & B ) has a probability of 50 % spin up and 50 % spin down . WavefunctionA ( WF_A ) is IN NEITHER state until it is ACTUALLY measured . the moment WF_A it is measured , WF_B assumes the opposite spin with DEFINITE probability . i understand that no information is transferred at a distance between WF_A and WF_B , but HOW does this happen . WHAT is the mechanism that collapes WF_B into a definite spin state at a distance ? I am not looking for explanations like `` satisfies laws of conservation '' ... instead i am looking for physical mechanism that allow this seemingly incredible phenomena to work . If the `` weirdness '' i am describing is an artifact of the way i am asking the question ( which is what i suspect ) , explainations there would be appreciated as well . An equally valid question would be `` what is the mechanism that causes WF_A to collapse when it is measured ? '' The schroedinger equation does not predict collapse as a result of any interaction , so it is outside the theory taught in undergraduate classes . There is no accepted theory ( or in my opinion , any reasonable theory at all ) as to why measurement causes a selection of a single eigenvalue out some non-eigenstate . The idea that measurement on one object has ramifications on another object seems more mysterious , but it 's not fundamentally different than the idea that measurement causes collapse in the first place . You wo n't find a satisfying answer .",0

Where the signal starts is unclear , because it can not start at the nerve ending .",0

"What makes people stop from taking their own life ? You make yourself stop . You stop seeing the advantage in being gone , in wanting to see others punished for not treating you as you think they should.And you start treating yourself as though you were someone special , someone that you really , really care about . You give them ( you ) the best of whatever you have - the best attention , the best potato chip out of the bag , the nicest clothes in your closet . You start telling yourself that you are someone special . Write notes and letters and stories about how good you are , and all the things you want to have and do and all the opportunities that are out there for you.And every day , you look in the mirror and say `` This is going to be a great day . '' Even if you do n't believe it , you say it . And you stop during the day and `` smell the roses . '' You find the things you like to do and you do them - because you are special and you deserve it.If you 're looking to punish people , this will annoy them much more , because you 'll have found a joy in life that they do n't have . It will attract into your life people that will like to be around you . And your whole life will blossom .",0

"how did the universe start ? From all the evidence science has on the subject , the universe began spontaneously as a point source ( singularity ) of infinite density and energy .

"What items do I need for winter camping to stay warm ? A nice pair of silk long johns is a good place to start . Other little treats for yourself include down clothing , they even make pants . I have a pair of down booties for use in the sleeping bag . Other little clothing tidbits . Wear a hat at all times , even sleeping . You can also sleep with a warm water bottle . Some cautions with this : make sure you know whether the bottle leaks and Nalgene 's are notoriously leaky , if you or your bag gets wet , you may be having a harder time keeping warm . If so you can contain it in a ziplock bag or a roll down velcro closure bag . If the water is too hot , you should put it in a sock or something to keep from burning your skin . My hiking buddy/co worker went to bed with a hot water nalgene between his thighs one night . He thought that was clever because a LOT of blood passes through there and warm blood travels to other parts of the body , warming them . But he woke up with blisters on his thighs ... dangerously close to the family jewels . Last word about hot water bottle , if you use a collapsible canteen or bottle , make sure you fill it allllll the way up , because even then your bottle will cave in as the water cools down . At the very least you want to minimize this so you do n't ruin your bottle . If the bottle cools this way , it will never hold as much as it used to.A good camping mat . The closed cell foam ones that roll up are cheap and effective and very lightweight , the next step up is the self inflating ones but they are heavier . And you can buy covers for those inflating mats that convert them into a chair.You need to dress warm . The most effective thing in my opinion , and also more versatile , is to dress in multiple light layers . In the winter , I wear about 8 layers in the coldest weather ... long john shirt , tee shirt , maybe a button down shirt , a fleece vest , as many fleece crewneck tops ( the fuzzy polartec type , not sweathshirt fleece ) as I can pile on , and my rain jacket . The good news is that if I can add or remove pieces at will until I am perfectly comfortable . IF you go the other route of a couple indoor layers and then one big poofy piece you need to understand the principles of loft , which includes your sleeping bag.Loft is the way insulation in a comforter , parka , or sleeping bag works . They create tiny little air pockets around you and hold YOUR OWN body heat in them . IF you have a lot of clothing between you and the insulating item , you will actually defeat the purpose of the item because you insulate the item FROM your body heat . This is why many things are true : it is better to sleep with fewer clothing items when you want to be warmer in the bag . It is also important not to compromise loft by choosing an item that does n't fit your body and causes you to squash it from the inside out , or with a bunch of heavy layers on top of it to squash it from the outside in . If you compress your item too much , even in storage , or in your pack or its stuff sack , there are fewer air pockets formed and the item does n't work as well.SO choose ONE dressing strategy and know how to apply it.Other important facts : All the things discussed so far are only ways to insulate yourself . They are not generating any heat on their own . To do that , you need to DRINK plenty of water , and you need to EAT , warm foods that are high in sugars and fats are excellent , and you need to MOVE . A bedtime snack can be anything from a candy bar to a stick of butter , NO kidding ! A bedtime activity could be a couple minutes jumping up and down , then one last go at the fire . AND YOU MUST DRINK WATER . Even if you ca n't stand cold liquids . EVEN IF you do n't want to be up all night peeing . Your body needs the water to circulate the blood , and to metabolize food , both of which assist you in staying warm . Another thing you need to know about water is that both dehydration and hypothermia have the early warning sign of disorientation and confusion . The trouble is , if YOU are the one",0

Do n't know if this 'll work on an Apple , but I sometimes have that happen on a pc with optical mouse , mouses , mices ... ..If it has a usb connection , simply unplugging and replugging gets it to work.When it 's a a ps2 connection , I usually have to reboot.These are all things to try before concluding the mouse has gone bad.Then ... .. if it 's a ball mouse , try cleaning the ball and the roller bearings it rides against using rubbing alcohol and a q-tip.Test the mouse on another system if you can .

"Why does my new computer suddenly run very slow when CD-R is accessing data ? ( This is a new problem. ) ? Even when Winamp is playing an mp3 from the hard drive , it will suddenly play very slowly if the CD-R reads something on a CD for another program . It did n't do this when the computer was new ( 3 months ago ) , but just started . instead of ripping CD audio at 18X , it is around 7X now . It 's hard to say what could be the exact cause of the problem , but most problems with speed on a computer somehow tie back to Spyware issues . Many times spyware/adware programs that are running in the background ( depending on which type ) will try to access all your drives ( not only the CD drive , but the HDD as well ) and decrease your machine 's performance . The other possiblity could be a hardware issue , as a technician , I 've seen many times data cables go bad or CD motors fail . You could be running out of RAM , Since the machine is only about 3 months old , i doubt very much it 's hardware ( but i 'd definitely suggest getting the Laser cleaned with a CD laser cleaner ) . The problem is most likely software related ( either spyware or a settings issue ( like a DMA setting or something ) ) . Either way , since you 're more than likely to be under some kind of mfg . warranty , i 'd take advantage and call them up , for some kind of support .",0
"What is igneous rock ? The term comes from the Latin word `` Ignis '' which means fire . Igneous rocks are produced by melting within the earth and later cooling of the molten magma.There are two major subdivisions of igneous rocks : ExtrusiveIntrusiveExtrusive igneous rocks come from volcanic activity . They are `` extruded ' by being ejected from a volcano or being part of a slow moving lava flow on the surface of the earth . Examples : basalt flows , pumice , obsidian , ash , scoriaIntrusive igneous rocks are formed by these molten rocks as they cool within the earth . The slow cooling allows the rock to separate into different minerals and form grains .

"who is the presedent of canada ? No one . We do not have Presidents ( thank God ) . The official head of state of Canada is the Governor General ( Her Excellency the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean ) , who represents our Queen , Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.The Governor General takes the advice of the Prime Minister who is currently Stephen Harper.To echo a comment that someone made , we do have a very good system of government here . It is based on the Parliament system style of government used in the United Kingdom.The previous government lost a `` vote of confidence '' , and when this happens we normally hold an election . This only happened because we had a minority Liberal government . When the Gomery Report came out , the opposition parties ganged up and voted against the minority government.If you have a majority government , you 're stuck with the government until at most 5 years . But we usually have elections every 4 years.One thing we normally have more open politics here because of the parliamentary style of government . The leader of the opposition maintains a fairly good check on the actions of the ruling government . Our news is mainly revolving around the government and the goings on with politics and not sensational shootings and murder , so we also keep a sharp eye on our politicians.If you 're interested in learning more about my country and our style of government , please visit http : //www.canada.gc.ca/",0

"what is prolactaine ? no spasm Prolactin is a hormone synthesised and secreted by lactotrope cells in the adenohypophysis ( anterior pituitary gland ) . Prolactin is made up of 199 amino acids , and has a molecular weight of about 23,000 daltons . Prolactin has many effects , the most significant of which is to stimulate the mammary glands to produce milk ( lactation ) .Increased serum prolactin during pregnancy causes enlargement of the mammary glands of the breasts and increases the production of milk . However , the high levels of estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy acts directly on the breasts to stop ejection of milk . It is only when the levels of these hormones fall after child birth that milk ejection is possible.Sometimes , newborn babies ( males as well as females ) secrete a milky substance from their nipples . This substance is called Witch 's milk . This is caused by the fetus ' being affected by prolactin circulating in the mother just before birth , and usually stops soon after birth",0

"which are better ... sit ups or crunches ? Traditional sit-ups emphasize sitting up rather than merely pulling your sternum down to meet your pelvis . The psoas muscles run from the lower back to the front of the thighs . This muscle action is to pull the thighs closer to the torso.This action is the major component of sitting up . Because of this , when you are doing sit ups your psoas muscles are the primary muscles being engaged and not your abdominal exercises .

If the problem is such that you can approximate the answer , then you can discretize the parameters as small slices of time and come up with an approximate answer - without using calculus .",0
"why is the sky blue ? Space is black and the sun is like yellowish-orangish , so why blue , or sometimes gray The sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering . This effect was actually first observed and described by John Tyndall , and a only few years later was explored in more detail by Lord Rayleigh.Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of light by particles . In the case of the sky , these particles are the molecules of air , themselves , and not dust or water vapor as is often proferred . The scattering depends on the wavelength of the light . Light towards the violet end of the spectrum scatters more than light at the red end . Sunlight is scattered throughout the sky and causes it to appear blue to an observer on the ground . The reason the sky does n't appear violet to us has to do with the sensetivity of the cones in the human eye.Just as the blue light gets scattered , red light from the sun travels farther , which is why the sun appears yellowish-orangish . In space the sun appears noticeably more blue . Space is black because there are almost no particles to scatter light .",0

You have to deal with that first , long distance or not ... you have to respect yourself enough to honor that . If you want to stay committed there can be no question of dating other people . That should end the questions right there . If you are n't sure about the long distance relationship , end it or stipulate that you are going to see other people . Once you are there you can make a decision . Going on a date with your friend to see what happens does not commit you to him forever , but it can be cruel and encourage him . It could also endyour friendship ( wow , I just broke the guy-code and encouraged you to use the `` I like you , but as a friend line '' . I 'll probably burn in guy-hell ( which is probably a lot like ballet performed by drag queens ) If you do n't feel like you are romantically interested in him you should tell him .

"box and whisker plots ? how do you pick out the numbers to use with a box and whisker plot when you have all the quartiles , and smallest and largest numbers ? A box-and-whisker plot can be useful for handling many data values . They allow people to explore data and to draw informal conclusions when two or more variables are present . It shows only certain statistics rather than all the data . Five-number summary is another name for the visual representations of the box-and-whisker plot . The five-number summary consists of the median , the quartiles , and the smallest and greatest values in the distribution . Immediate visuals of a box-and-whisker plot are the center , the spread , and the overall range of distribution . The first step in constructing a box-and-whisker plot is to first find the median , thelower quartile and the upper quartile of a given set of data . Example : The following set of numbers are the amount of marbles fifteen different boys own ( they are arranged from least to greatest ) .18 27 34 52 54 59 61 68 78 82 85 87 91 93 100 First find the median . The median is the value exactly in the middle of an ordered set of numbers . *68 is the medianNext , we consider only the values to the left of the median : 18 27 34 52 54 59 61 . We now find the median of this set of numbers . Remember , the median is the value exactly in the middle oa an ordered set of numbers . Thus 52 is the median of the scores less than the median of all scores , and therefore is the lower quartile.52 is the lower quartileNow consider only the values to the right of the median : 78 82 85 87 91 93 100 . We now find the median of this set of numbers . The median 87 is therefore called the upper quartile . 87 is the upper quartile ( *If you 're finding the median in an ordered set with an even number of values , you must take the average of the two middle numbers . For example : 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 . Add the two middle numbers . 5 + 7 = 12 . Divided 12 by 2 to get the average . 12 / 2 = 6 . Therefore 6 is the median for the ordered set of 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 . ) You are now ready to find the interquartile range ( IQR ) . The interquartile range is the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile . In our case the IQR = 87 - 52 = 35 . The IQR is a very useful measurement . It is useful because it is less influenced by extreme values , it limits the range to the middle 50 % of the values.35 is the interquartile rangeplease review these pages .",0

"Who ran the fastest forty ever at the combine ? A couple of my guesses would be Deion , Darrell Green , maybe even Mike Vick . Also , who do you think ran the fastest forty ever ... .not just at the combine . There is no official world record for 40 yards.The shortest distance that the IAAF , track and field 's international governing body , recognizes for world-record purposes is an indoor 50 meters , or about 54 yards . It is 5.56 seconds and it was set by Canadian sprinter Donovan Bailey in 1996 . There is also a world record for 60 meters -- 6.39 seconds by American Maurice Greene in 1998.But it is another Canadian , Ben Johnson , who is believed to have run 40 yards faster than any human in history . Johnson is best known for injecting copious amounts of steroids and winning the 100 meters at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul in 9.79 seconds , only to have his gold medal and world record stripped after failing a post-race drug test.Timing officials have since broken down that famed race into 10-meter increments , and Johnson was so preposterously fast that he went through 50 meters in 5.52 seconds and 60 meters in 6.37 -- both under the current world records at those distances . He went through 40 yards that day in 4.38 seconds.He was running in spikes . . . on a warm afternoon perfectly suited for sprinting . . . with a slight tailwind . . . with years of training from arguably track 's top coach , Charlie Francis . . . with Carl Lewis and six others of the fastest men on the planet chasing him . . . with 69,000 people roaring at Seoul 's Olympic Stadium . . . with hundreds of millions of people watching on TV . . . with the ultimate prize in sports , an Olympic gold medal , at stake.And , as we learned later , with muscles built with the assistance of the anabolic steroid stanazolol.Four-point-three-eight seconds.Then again , maybe Ben Johnson is n't the fastest 40-yard man in the world.Maybe half the NFL is faster.o o oIt can be the most important few hours of a football player 's career . It is the day NFL scouts come to campus to determine whether prospects have what it takes to play at the next level.Players are measured to the quarter-inch . They 're weighed to the half-pound . They do a vertical jump and a standing broad jump . They see how many times they can bench-press 225 pounds . They do a 20-yard shuttle drill and something called a three-cone drill . They are put through a short workout specific to their position.But it is something else that commands everyone 's attention , something else that interrupts the businesslike atmosphere of players shuffling from one station to the next . Something else that causes scouts and spectators to snap to attention.The 40-yard dash.It is the day 's shortest event , and the most critical . No other statistic carries more influence for an NFL prospect , no single number has more impact on his draft fortunes . It 's not called Pro Scouting Day or Pro Prospect Day or Pro Workout Day . The sign taped to the weight-room door at San Diego State on March 19 says : `` Pro Timing Day . `` Or as local football agent David Caravantes puts it : `` There 's football speed and there 's 40 speed , and the scouts will all tell you they understand that and game film is the most important thing . But how many defensive backs who ran a 4.6 are left on the draft board ahead of guys who ran 4.3 ? `` I 'll give you another example . There 's this DB who was originally projected as a first-rounder . But he did n't run the 40 that fast -- something like 4.6 instead of in the 4.4s -- and now they 're talking about him slipping to the second round . Well , he 's looking at a minimum $ 4 million signing bonus if he goes in the first round and only about $ 1.6 million if he goes in the middle of the second round . `` You do the math . `` The players are inside the SDSU weight room being measured and weighed .

"I cant pay for college how do i make more $ with only high school ? You are n't going to be making a lot of money with just a high school degree unless you have some new invention or idea that will revolutionize the world.There are a lot of grants and scholarships out there that will pay for your college as long as you do well while you are in college so that they continue to give you funding.Actually the poorer you are the more free money you will get . If you have done well in high school the easier it is to get funding . You can also get scholarships from all over the place . There are a lot of places to look on the internet for scholarships and the college you pick can also assist you in finding scholarships.At the very least there are student loans that will pay for your college and you have to pay those back when you have completed college , but it is well worth going to college than not going .",0

"Why does carbon form so many compounds ? There are lots of reasons why there are large number of organic compounds .I ’ m giving U few of them.Catenation : The tendency of an element to form chains of identical atoms is called catenation . This tendency is observed in the case of non-metals showing covalency of two or more . However , this property is maximum in carbon as it can combine with other carbon atoms by single , double or triple covalent bonds . The bonding can be extended to form long open chain ( straight or branched ) or closed ones . Catenation property depends upon the value of bond energy which is maximum in the case of carbon . Bond : C-C Si-Si S-S P-P N-N O-OBond energy : 83 54 54 50 39 35 ( approximately ) ( kcal/mol ) The stability or the strength of the bond decreases as the bond energy decreases . Hence , the tendency of catenation decreases in the following manner ; C > Si ~ S > P > N > OTendency to combine with other non-metals : Carbon has the ability to form strong covalent bonds with many other atoms such as H , O , S , N , Cl , Br , I , etc . The C-C bond energy is approximately equals to the magnitude of bond energies between carbon and various other atoms.Bond C-C C-H C-O C-Cl C-N C-BrBond energy 83.0 97.0 86.0 81.0 73.0 68.0 ( approximately ) ( kcal/mol ) Isomerism is one of the reason also .",0

It is a period of 40 days when Catholics remember the 40 days Jesus fasted in the desert and his ultimate sacrifice at the end of Lent , Good Friday . Marti Gras ( french for Fat Tuesday ) has traditionally become the time for celebration as a last big fling before Lent arrives and people try to restrict themselves more . Also , during Lent , Catholics are supposed to avoid meat other than fish on fridays . On Ash Wednesday , Catholics go to a church service during which the entire congregation processes up to have the priest place ashes on their forehead as a reminder that `` of dust we were made and to dust we shall return '' and our own mortalities .",0

There is too much movie out there that depict this phenom , is n't it ? So how we can sure that this is not possible to be legal in the future ? Hi there , You are absolutely right . It is likely that Human Cloning will be accepted in the future . Just think of it ... Would n't it be wonderful to clone persons like Einstein , Socrates , and other great people who have influenced this world ? But I think there must be restrictions on whom to clone .

"nursing care plan who had post op TAH-BSO ? Are you a nursing student with lack of resources ? Anyone who has had this medical procedure needs to carefully follow her doctor 's advice and report any signs or symptoms which could indicate complications.I had it done . Other than report anything which seems abnormal ( and do n't let strange things shock the nurse or whoever , get a serious response in the rare event it does happen- such as passing gas or stool vaginally ) . Things I found helpful was support the abdomenal area with a folded blanket or pillow when getting up or coughing or sitting in a chair even . Once you go on a regular diet be sure to get lots of fluids , eat foods that give bulk to your stool without the extra gas and walk as much as your doctor allows you to without over doing it . It is very important to avoid constipation which can stretch your colon into a pouch . That pouch could cause problems for years to come . Just let your doctor know if constipation does become an issue . Get your rest and push yourself a bit more each day as you are able to tolerate it . The healing process needs time , but you will get there . If you are a nursing student , I would strongly suggest you invest in a care plan book with information that you need to know in order to provide the proper care to your patients . Good luck .",0

"May I Know which Organ Produces Blood PLasma ? I need it for school homework before 2 Febuary plz ! ! ! ! ! ! ! No organ produces Blood Plasma , it is a product of several organs or one could say the body . It consists of ( mostly ) water , salts ( electrolytes ) , and proteins ( albumin and antibodies being the majority ) . All the water , salts , and proteins ultimately are derived from the GI tract ; i.e. , what you eat . The water and salts are regulated by the renal system . Albumin is produced by the liver ( and it is in the majority for plasma protein ) and antibodies are a product of the immune system . There is also a balance of proteins and water within the vasculature ( intravascular space ) and without ( extravascular space ) . So , there is always an influx/efflux balance between your tissues and the vasculature depending on the osmostic pressure ( mostly ) and mechanical pressure . This is all in one giant balance or homeostasis most of the time . Hence , why it 's a good idea to see plasma as a total body product.I just read the above answers .

"why some people are gay ? I wish I could say I read Phillips answer , but I could n't maintain focus . So , risking repeating elements of his analysis , I 'm going to give this question a stab , but with a biological/evoluationary bent.Evolutionary arguments have been offered for male homosexuality . For example , Symons ( 1979 ) argues that homosexuality results from a meme that takes advantage of the inborn male propensity to find sexual variety interesting . Normally this propensity would be adaptive because it would encourage males to attempt sexual relations with many women , which would result in more offspring . But a meme could parasitize this propensity , redirecting sexual interest to non-adaptive objects , as in fetishism or homosexuality . Epigenetic arguments have been inspired by work on pre-natal hormones . Dîrner and his colleagues ( cited in LeVay 1994 ) link stress during pregnancy to hormonal effects on the fetus that would lead to homosexuality . This could be part of a mother 's adaptive reproductive strategy . That is , in times of stress , when it is difficult to raise children , it may be adaptive to have some homosexual children who could help their siblings raise offspring instead of having offspring of their own.Memic and epigenetic arguments may explain some aspects of homosexuality , such as the cultural variations in practices or identities , or specific behaviors of homosexuals ( femininity for example ) . However , the biological studies of homosexuality , together with the extraordinary cross-cultural similarities of exclusive homosexuals ( Whitam 1983 ) suggest that some aspects of homosexuality ( e.g . orientation ) are at least partly determined by genes.The basic problem for genetic explanations of homosexuality is to account for how a gene that does not lead to offspring could survive the pressures of natural selection . One possibility is that a maladaptive gene for homosexuality might re-occur repeatedly in a population if it results from the frequent mutation of a gene that is normally adaptive . However , people with maladaptive genes rarely exceed 1 % of the population , while male homosexuality apparently occurs much more frequently ( Whitam and Mathy 1986 ; Gadpaille 1980 ; Diamond 1993 ) . Another possibility is that a recessive gene for homosexuality might have advantages that allow it to pass on to future generations . For example , homosexuals could directly help their relatives ( who share the recessive gene ) raise more children . This `` kin selection '' hypothesis predicts more homosexuality in those societies where homosexuals could most help their relatives ( for example , in endogamous societies where homosexuals would live nearby ) . Nevertheless , cross-cultural research shows that this is not the case ( Werner 1979 ) . Another possibility is that a homosexual gene itself , when combined with non-homosexual genes , may provide reproductive advantages . This latter scenario is sometimes known as the `` heterozygous '' hypothesis , although it is really about any type of gene combination ( LeVay 1994 ; Sommer 1990 ) . The heterozygous argument suggests that homosexuality results from genes for submissive behavior . An animal possessing only submissive genes would fail to reproduce for lack of trying . But an animal possessing only genes for dominance would also fail to reproduce because it would get killed for taking too many risks . It is the `` heterozygous '' males , who would most likely pass on their genes . By the genetic laws of probability , this would leave every generation with a certain percentage of individuals at the extremes . For example , if each of a pair of chromosomes had only one `` homosexual '' locus with only two possible alleles ( one for dominance and one for submissiveness ) this would leave a heterozygous couple with 25 % of their offspring homozygous for submissiveness , 50 % heterozygous , and 25 % homozygous for dominance . If , however , homosexuality were the result of the interaction of five ge",0
"How did Dinosaurs died ? So much of them around the world . How could all of them die in one sweep ? Why did all of the remaining dinosaurs die out suddenly at the end of the Cretaceous period ? There is a short answer and a long answer to this question . 2 Here is the short answer . No one knows for sure . 3 Here is the long answer . There are a number of theories . Some are scientific , and some are ridiculous . Most scientists believe in one or two main ones , but no one knows for sure . 4 The reason no one knows for sure is because the whole thing happened about 65 million years ago . No one was around to see or hear what was going on back then , and no one was around to keep records . 5 What we do know comes mainly from fossil records . Scientists study the fossils themselves , and they study the rock in which the fossils are found . Fossil records have n't given us definite proof for any one theory . This is because there are some problems with fossil records . For one thing , most fossil evidence of dinosaurs has been found in North America . We do n't know as much about dinosaur activity on other parts of the earth . Another problem is that it is very hard to date fossils . Dating fossils means determining how old they are . 6 One really interesting thing about the big dinosaur question is that scientists from many different fields are working to solve the problem . Astronomers , physicists , geologists , paleontologists , ecologists , chemists , geologists and others are all gathering evidence , experimenting , and researching to try to solve the puzzle . 7 The most popular theory is called the Alvarez Hypothesis . This hypothesis says that , 65 million years ago , a big asteroid hit the earth . This asteroid crash scattered dust high up into the atmosphere . It blocked much of the sunlight and caused the earth to become cooler . The crash also started huge fires , high winds , and violent storms that killed some of the dinosaurs . The lack of sunlight and warmth caused many plants to die . This shortage of plants for food caused the rest of the dinosaurs to die out . 8 The second most popular theory says that activity on the earth itself caused the extinction . As the supercontinent of Pangaea was breaking up , movement of the earth 's giant land plates caused volcanoes to erupt and the climate to change . These changes affected the earth 's atmosphere and temperature , and the dinosaurs died out from the cold or from lack of plants to eat . 9 Other theories suggest that dinosaurs became so big that they could n't move , or that there were too many dinosaurs and they ate up all of the food .",0

"I ve a very severe short sightedness which affects just an eye and doctors say glasses wo n't help . pls advice The doctor says the use of a glasses is out of the question since just one eye is affected and a thick lens according 2 him will affect d other eye and moreso i will ve a multiple vision Well , I do n't know the specifics of your problem , but I can offer a bit of an explanation of what your doctor said . Glasses would n't help you because the lenses for each eye would be dramatically different . Since you 're very near-sighted in the one eye , you would need a very strong lens that would ultimately make the image on your retina much smaller than the image on your other retina . If these two images are very different sizes , your brain ca n't put them together into one image and you see double . If both of your eyes can be corrected to 20/20 vision , I would ask your doctor ( or another doctor , if you 'd like a second opinion ) if LASIK is an option for you . This could possibly bring your very near-sighted eye close enough to the other eye so that your brain would be able to make a single image .",0

"Why are so many blacks calling each other the N-word when they hate it so much ? Seems like a double standard. ? Even the mayor of New Orleans called it a `` chocolate '' city . From my perspective , it has nothing to do with any one person or group finding a term `` offensive . '' It has everything to do with wanting POWER.One form or POWER is the `` double standard , '' in which one group of people can engage in some activity or speech which another group can not . There have been double standards since the dawn of time , and to this day , you will hear women complain about the double-standards about men 's sexual behavior and their general assertiveness as compared to that of women . A newer incarnation of the double standard is political correctness , in which one group of people attempt to control and limit the words or thoughts of another.When one group can effectively limit the ability of of another to do the same , the first group `` feels '' a sense of control or power . I say `` feels '' because any such quest for power , based in the desire to forbid another person from saying a particular 6-letter word is a misguided and inconsequential exertion of power . it really changes nothing ( at least in the short term ) . About the only thing it accomplishes is inflicting a sense of guilt on the intended target . If you 're motivated by guilt , it has worked . In the scheme of things , it 's minor . You can choose to fight it if you want , but to do so involves incurring the wrath of a politcally-correct society , who has accepted , for whatever reason , the argument from the messenger that this restriction should be enforced , not legally , but socially , via scorn , derision and ostracization . That may mean losing friends , losing your job , or quite possibly losing points on Yahoo Answers ( or even your entire account ) .So that 's the way I see it . And If the people who are trying to control the speech , be they black or female , or whatever , really look at it objectively , they ca n't help but admit that there 's a grasp for a modicum of power involved .",0

"i need to know phisical chemical properties of sodium thiocyanate ? from the link below , which includes a lot more information : Cyanic acid ( also called fulminic acid ) is an unstable ( explosive ) , poisonous , volatile , clear liquid with the structure of H-O-C=N ( the oxoacid formed from the pseudohalogen cyanide ) , which readily polymerizes to cyamelide and fulminic acid . Cyanuric acid ( also called pyrolithic acid ) , white monoclinic crystal with the structure of [ HOC ( NCOH ) 2N ] , is the compound of polymerized cyanic acid . Cyanic acid hydrolyses to ammonia and carbon dioxide in water . Its salts and esters are cyanates ( or called fulminates ) . Esters of normal cyanic acid are not known . There is another isomeric cyanic acid with the structure of H-N=C=O , which is called isocyanic acid . Its salts and esters are isocyanates . Cyanates ( or Isocyanates ) are used in the manufacturing pharmaceuticals , pesticides , textile softener , lubricants and industrial disinfectants through the conversion to polycyclic compounds ( such as hydantoins and imidazolons ) They are used as plastic additives and as heat treatment salt formulations for metals . Thiocyanate is a salt or ester of thiocyanic acid ( HSCN ) . Aqueous solutions of thiocyanic acid , also called sulfocyanic acid , are very strong acids of the equilibrium mixture of thiocyanic and isothiocyanic . Thiocyanates are bonded through the sulfur ( s ) with the structure R-S-C¡ÕN or the isomeric R-N=C=S ( isothiocyanates ) . Thiocyanates are bonded through the sulfur ( s ) which replace for the oxygen ( O ) atom . Thiocyanates are the sulfur analog of isocyanates . Organic as well as metallic thiocyanates [ CuSCN , Ca ( SCN ) 2 , NaSCN , KSCN ] are very versatile compounds . They have wide range of applications including manufacturing industrial chemicals , pharmaceuticals and pesticides . It is used in freezing solutions , fabric dyeing , electroplating , steel pickling , printing , and corrosion inhibitor against acid gases . It is used in photography industry as a stabilizer or accelerator .",0
"Explain how spectral observations ( red shift ) have led to the theory of the big bang. ? im in 10th garde and i need a detailed answerthank you Actually Einstein predicted the Big Bang before Hubble found the first observational evidence.Einstein found that in his theory of General Relativity that the universe as a whole should be either expanding or contracting . He did n't like this so he added an extra term the `` cosmological constant '' to balance the equations and have a universe that was not expanding or contracting . That sort of static universe was what was expected in those days.Meanwhile , Edmund Hubble began making observations in the 1920s from the Mt Wilson Observatory of distant `` nebulae . '' He had discovered previosuly that many of this faint blobs , previously thought to be gas clouds , were in fact galaxies like our own Milky Way . This was a big surprise since previosuly the Milky Way was the only galaxy , or what they called at the time , an `` island universe . `` So , it was natural for Hubble to look at the spectra of some of these distant galaxies . What he found was that , except for a couple of very nearby galaxies like M-31 the Andromeda Galaxy , all the other galaxies had shifted spectra . That is , these other galaxies has spectra which were redshifted , indicating that they were moving away from us.Further he found that the fainter galaxies ( which on average are farther away ) had the largest redshifts . This lead to the famous `` Hubble 's Law '' that says that the observed redshift is proportional to the distance a galaxy is from us.Einstein found out about Hubble 's discovery and realized what it meant - the whole universe is expanding . Although naively it looks like everything is moving away from us , all of space is expanding , so that an observor in any galaxy would detect the same thing - that every galaxy is moving away from them.The usual analogy is to think of rasins in rasin bread . As the bread rises all the dough ( space ) expands , so the distance between all rasins ( galaxies ) grows . Thus from any one rasin ( galaxy ) all the rest look like they are moving away.Einstein realized that his `` cosmological constant '' was unneccessary . He famously called it his `` greatest blunder '' and that he could have officially predicted the expansion of the universe before Hubble confirmed it with observations . ( And in fact , before Hubble 's discovery , other scientists like Willem de Sitter and Alexander Friedmann used the equantions of General Relativity to calculate an expanding universe . ) At that point it was realized that if space is expanding that in the past it must have been all bunched up in one spot . Just before Hubble Georges Lemaître realized this and thought that at first there was some sort of `` primaval atom '' from which everything else came from.Fred Hoyle did n't like Lemaitre 's idea at all , not the least of which was because Lemaitre insisted that God started the whole thing . Hoyle developed a rival theory the Steady State universe , and dismissed the other type of ideas as a `` hot big bang . '' Of course Hoyle 's term , meant as a put-down , became the offical name . ( Hoyle 's Steady State Theory was a serious rival to the Big Bang until the 1960s and the discovery of the microwave background . ) It was n't until 1948 that the modern aspects of the Big Bang were proposed by George Gamow and Ralph Alpher . These guys showed that from an initial explosion of compressed everything one would get the correct mixture of hydrogen and helium and other trace elements observed in the whole universe . That is , if one starts from a hot subatomic , compressed mixture and lets it go , it will recombine into the right ratio of atoms . ( Right being the ration actually observed . ) And so it goes from there , to much more observational evidence for the Big Bang , as well as lots of theoretical progress . At the moment we know that the old cyclical idea , that the universe expands and then contracts , is wrong . In fact the universe seems to be accelerating , tha",0
"is super conductor becoming a reality ? Superconductors are a reality .

"Why do my feet smell so bad ? The main reason some people 's feet ( or more precisely , some people 's socks and shoes ) smell worse than other people 's is that some people sweat more than other people . This is just one of the many variable physiological qualities of human beings . This is also why sometimes your feet smell much worse than at other times -- it all has to do with how much you sweat.So , since foot odor is caused by bacteria digesting sweat , there are two main ways to reduce the stink . You can : * decrease the amount of bacteria on your feet * decrease the amount of sweat that collects on your feet and in your shoes Reducing the level of bacteria is really a matter of cleanliness . To control the bacteria population on you feet , you should : * wash your feet with strong anti-bacterial soap * wear clean socks * do n't wear the same shoes everyday - give a pair of shoes 24 hours or more to air out before wearing them again To reduce the amount of sweat that collects in your shoes , you should : * wear well-ventilated shoes instead of very constrictive shoes , such as boots * always wear socks , preferably made of cotton or other absorbent materials that absorb a lot of the sweat so the bacteria ca n't feed on it * change your socks a few times a day * buy some absorbent Odor-Eater type shoe inserts * apply an antiperspirant to your feet If your foot odor is really bad and these solutions do n't help much , then you should see a doctor . There are a number of prescription drugs that can treat serious foot odor , some by killing bacteria and some by reducing foot sweat .",0

"what is the function of stipules ? wha is the importance of stipules ? There are a number of interesting functions demonstrated for stipules of certain plant species.Also protection of emerging leaves . 1 . Stipules that are green may be leaf-like ( Examples : flowering quince , a geranium , and a sycamore ) , linear , thread-like , or reduced to minute scales , thereby requiring a hand lens to see . Plant biologists have assumed that green stipules are photosynthetic , but ecophysiologists generally have not determined how significant green stipules may be as temporary or persistent photosynthetic structures . Anatomical reports on photosynthetic stipules are exceedingly rare , so that we know little about the presence of stomates and the nature of the mesophyll in stipules . 2 . If hardened with lignin , a stipule may become modified as a spine , i.e. , a stipular spine . In many species , one stipular spine or a pair of stipular spines may be observed at each node , e.g. , among legumes , and for legumes , the stipular spine is the typical type of shoot armature ( Examples : coral tree , Chloroleucon , and a mimosa ) . Obviously , stipular spines were effective in their specific native habitat for many of these cases as an adaptation to reduce predation by vertebrate herbivores . Very large , hollow stipular spines in certain species of bull acacia ( Acacia , Family Mimosaceae ) serve as homes for ants , which defend the plant from all other herbivores . Stipular spines are extremely important forms of shoot armature for the succulent euphorbs ( Family Euphorbiaceae ; examples : crown-of-thorns , young stipular spines , and old stipular spines ) , most species of which occur in thorny scrub and woodland as well as desert habitats in Africa and southern Asia . Stipular spines also are present on certain climbers . 3 . In many groups of plants , stipules are short-lived , nonphotosynthetic structures that abscise before the leaf is fully expanded ( a legume ) . Such stipules tend to be nongreen , often hyaline ( an elm ) , off-white ( ramie ) , yellow , or brownish , but there are some remarkable cases where the stipule is brilliantly colored , especially with anthocyanins , red to purple vacuolar pigments ( Talauma hodgsonii ) . A nongreen stipule probably can be regarded as vestigial , lacking any function for the mature leaf and shoot but perhaps protecting the young leaf while it is at the growing tip . 4 . Sometimes stipules and stipels have evolved as extrafloral nectaries , utilized to nourish mutualistic ants , or other types of glands . 5 . In Smilax , a lianaceous monocotyledon , the stipule may develop as a tendril . 6 . For whatever function , corky stipules are known from certain dryland shrubs , for example , the species of creosote bush ( Larrea young stipules of L. tridentata and older stipules in L. nitida ) in New World deserts and the tough-leaved evergreen species of Ceanothus in California chaparral .",0

"CAN ANYBODY CLARIFY ? If a person suffered from amnesia and then was cured would they remember that they forgot ? It is hard to say.The underlying cause of amnesia is critical to answer this question.If you are talking a traumatic event to the brain , then the memories could be permanetly lost . The physical structure of the brain could have been damaged beyond repair and the information contained there would be lost.Sometimes , the area is just injured and takes time to heal . In this case , over time the memories would begin to come back as the brain reroutes synapses to accommodate the injury.If it was a psychological amensia , then it may or may not come back depending on how the person can cope with the experience . In this case , there is usually very little physical brain involvment.In general , in a highly stressfulevent , adrenalize and stres hormones cause memory to be faulty at best . So in an crisis people rarely recollect events in the most accurate manner.For a whole lot of unsubsantiated opinion , see the Wikipedia entry : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmnesiaOr for Types of amnesia : http : //ahsmail.uwaterloo.ca/kin356/amnesia/amnesia2.htmlhttp : //www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php ? newsid=9673For a better reference check out http : //news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/a-b/167771.stm",0

"what are the seven wonders of the world ? This gets asked daily ... .The 7 wonders of the ancient world : * The Great Pyramid of Giza It is the one and only Ancient Wonder which does not require a description by early historians and poets . It is the one and only Ancient Wonder that does not need speculations concerning its appearance , size , and shape . It is the oldest , yet it is the only surviving of the Seven Ancient Wonders . It is the Great Pyramid of Giza . * The Hanging Gardens of Babylon Some stories indicate the Hanging Gardens towered hundreds of feet into the air , but archaeological explorations indicate a more modest , but still impressive , height . * The Statue of Zeus at Olympia This is a statue of the God in whose honor the Ancient Olympic games were held . It was located on the land that gave its very name to the Olympics . At the time of the games , wars stopped , and athletes came from Asia Minor , Syria , Egypt , and Sicily to celebrate the Olympics and to worship their king of Gods : Zeus . * The Colossus of Rhodes The island of Rhodes was an important economic centre in the ancient world . It is located off the southwestern tip of Asia Minor where the Aegean Sea meets the Mediterranean . The capitol city , also named Rhodes , was built in 408 B.C * The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus Eight hundred years after its destruction , the magnificent Temple of Artemis at Ephesus , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , had been completely forgotten by the people of the town that had once held it in such pride… * The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus is the burial place of an ancient king . Yet the Mausoleum is different - so different from the Pyramid that it earned its reputation - and a spot within the list - for other reasons . Geographically , it is closer to the Temple of Artemis ... And it was the beauty of the tomb rather than its size that fascinated its visitors for years . * The Pharos of Alexandria ( The Lighthouse of Alexandria ) Of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , only one had a practical use in addition to its architectural elegance : The Lighthouse of Alexandria . For sailors , it ensured a safe return to the Great Harbor . For architects , it meant even more : it was the tallest building on Earth . And for scientists , it was the mysterious mirror that fascinated them most ... The mirror which reflection could be seen more than 50 km ( 35 miles ) off-shore.Of those , opnly the Pyramids remain today.There are more modern wonders : * Great Pyramid of Giza* Great Wall of China* Taj Mahal* Serengeti Migration* Galapagos Islands* Grand Canyon* Machu PicchuModern world : * Channel Tunnel* CN Tower* Empire State Building* Golden Gate Bridge* Itaipu Dam* Netherlands ' Tidal Defences* Panama CanalNatural wonders : * Grand Canyon* Great Barrier Reef* Harbor of Rio de Janeiro* Mount Everest* Northern Lights* Paricutín volcano* Victoria FallsUnderwater wonders : PalauBelize Barrier ReefGreat Barrier ReefDeep-Sea VentsGalapagos IslandsLake BaikalNorthern Red Sea",0

"*Ali versus Tyson* Who would win ? This is a theoretical question ( of course Tyson would win today ) . If both men were in their prime at the peak of their success and squared off who would win ? Mike Tyson in his prime was a monster . With his power and skill combined , you 'd think he was unbeatable . He knew how to bob and weave right under an opponent 's punches and come back with vicious combos to the head and body.However , I do n't think any heavyweight boxer ever could outbox Ali . Muhammad Ali knew how to use the ring and could use his reach advantage to keep Tyson at the perfect distance to land punches while avoiding being hit himself . Not that I do n't think Ali could n't take Tyson 's punches , but those body shots would have worn him down a bit by the later rounds.Overall , I say an unanimous decision victory for Ali , though not a very impressive one .",0

In areas where there are no human interests , natural phenomena do not result in natural disasters.A cyclone is the rotation of a volume of air about an area of low atmospheric pressure . Cyclones are responsible for a wide variety of different meteorological phenomena such as tropical cyclones and tornadoes . Because of this , most weather forecasters avoid using the term cyclone without a qualifying term.An earthquake is a sudden and sometimes catastrophic movement of a part of the Earth 's surface . Earthquakes result from the dynamic release of elastic strain energy that radiates seismic waves . Earthquakes typically result from the movement of faults , planar zones of deformation within the Earth 's upper crust . Most earthquakes are tectonic , but they also occur in volcanic regions and as the result of a number of anthropogenic sources , such as reservoir induced seismicity , mining and the removal or injection of fluids into the crust.A tsunami is a series of waves generated when water in a lake or the sea is rapidly displaced on a massive scale . Earthquakes , landslides , volcanic eruptions and large meteorite impacts all have the potential to generate a tsunami . The effects of a tsunami can range from unnoticeable to devastating .",0

"What is the best treatment for canker sores ? Any way to promote healing or maybe reduce the pain ? Canker sores usually go away without any treatment . For pain relief , you can try taking ibuprofen ( brand name : Advil ) or acetaminophen ( brand name : Tylenol ) . Other medicines , such as Anbesol , Oragel , Orabase and Zilactin-B , might keep your canker sores from becoming irritated by eating , drinking or brushing your teeth . You put these medicines right on the sore.You can also mix equal amounts of Milk of Magnesia and Benadryl Allergy liquid . After it 's mixed , you can swish a teaspoonful in your mouth for about 1 minute and then spit it out . If you do this every 4 to 6 hours , your canker sores may hurt less.Some people think that sucking on zinc lozenges , taking vitamin C or vitamin B complex , using a sage-and-chamomile mouthwash or taking a lysine supplement helps their canker sores heal faster .",0

"why gals have boobs ? Well… “ gals , ” ( as you call them ) have breast mainly for two reasons:1 ) They are necessary to provide nourishment to their offspring ( children ) just as all other female animals in nature do . Before the invention and convenience of bottles and breast formula , breast milk was the only possible food for newborns to consume . The child 's body structure was not yet developed enough for the breakdown and distribution of vitamins , minerals , etc from solid food yet , so breast milk provided them with the needed nutrients from what the mother was eating to develop properly.2 ) The other reason coincides with the first . Females have breast as an aesthetically attractive feature to attract males . In the natural process of things , females are the force behind our survival , ( as a human race ) , and just like all other animals , they have inborn “ assets ” ( trying to be tactful here ) that assist them in acquiring a mating partner .",0

"What is the best way to get better abdominal muscles ? First and foremost , stay away from any ab machine.For the upper abs , focus on crunches which effectively work the abdominals better than sit-ups or any machine on the market.For the lower abs , keep in mind there is very little muscle tissue there so decreasing levels of body fat is the most effective way to bring out the best in this area . Hanging leg raises , v-situps and reverse curls are among some of the best exercise for this region . Always make sure your pelvis curls up to maximize lower abdominal contraction during these exercises.As far as fat loss and getting ripped goes , cardio , cardio , cardio . In the morning , on an empty stomach at about 70-80 % of your maximum heart rate for about 30-45 minutes . This combined with a common sense diet will quickly shed body fat so you can actually see those abs you 've developed . I would encourage you to seek the advice and guidance of a personal trainer in your area for further education on these principles .

"Definitions ? please ! ? Please describe the following and how the 're usedResource-Oil -Natural Gas-Coal-Water-Wood- In the context of your question , A resource is a source of material or energy that may be consumed , changed , or dispersed to the point it is no longer easily usable . Examples would be copper ore , oxygen in the atmosphere , helium gas taken from oil wells , water , sand , or even soil . Anything we do consumes or utilizes some sort of resource . Breathing uses oxygen from the air . Copper is used for wiring and piping . Helium is used for scientific research and birthday balloons . Sand is used to make concrete . Water is used for drinking , irrigation , and generating hydroelectric power . Soil is used for growing crops . None of these are exhaustive lists , just examples . Oil : Oil is a mixture of organic compounds extracted from the earth by drilling . It is created from organic materials deposited in sedimentary rock that are altered by heat , pressure , and biotic processes to create it . Oil is used to make gasoline , diesel , airplane fuel , plastic , shampoo , rubber , antihistamines , and many other products . Natural gas : It is an organic gas that is also extracted from the earth by drilling . It is generated by a similar process to that for oil generation . It is used to heat homes , make fertilizer , and some plastics . Water : Water is found in many forms , but mostly as either fresh or saltwater . Fresh water is used for drinking , irrigation , etc . Saltwater is not as useful directly to man , but is an essential part of our environment as the oceans both support food supplies and have a large effect on the climate . Wood : Wood comes from living organisms- trees . Wood can be used for building many things , including houses . It is used for fuel and is the primary source of fuel in some parts of the world .",0

"How do you bind a vampire or a werewolf ? Aside from holy water , garlic , etc. , what do the myths say ? If werewolves can be killed with a silver bullet , with what material do you capture them alive ? Do plain metal chains work ? Or do they have to be made of certain materials ? The Slavs ( from around the year 300 ) believed that vampires were afraid of silver ( but could n't be killed with it ) and that one could kill them by cutting their head off and placing it between their legs , or by stabbing them with a wooden stake in the heart . During the Middle Ages , the myth transformed a bit . People used holy water , wooden stake , and cross to kill a vampire ( we can see the influence of the Christianity here ) . If people suspected that a dead person has turned into a vampire , they would dig them out and stick a stake into the heart . This was n't meant to kill the vampire but to bind it to the grave . Serbs believed that every single drop of blood had to be destroyed or else the vampire would still be `` alive '' ( they were more or less living corpses , but you get my point ) so they used to burn the vampire after that . Then butterflies would fly out of the vampire and people had to kill each one of them . Garlic can only scare the vampire because of its strong and unpleasant smell . In order to stop the vampire 's visits at night , people would hang garlic near every hole in the house ( for example keyhole , chimney , windows ... , because people believed that the vampire could enter the house even through the smallest hole ) . One could also throw some seeds before the vampire , since they had to stop and count them all . I 'm not really sure how they used to capture them . I know vampires could be captured by stealing that cloth they had over them in the grave , but I have seen this only in vampire stories . But in reality , people were just killing them and they were probably too scared to just capture them ( that 'd be pointless , would n't it ) . Although in Asia there were some kinds of vampires which people used to capture and then keep them in wooden cages and feed them eggs : P I have n't heard of any captured werewolves either . If you want to investigate a bit , try reading some legends and old beliefs from the Balkans ; I promise you 'll find it very interesting !",0

"can i have a child if i have crohns and what are the risk ? can i have achid if I have crohns and what are the risk ? Most women with Crohn 's disease are able to deliver healthy , full-term babies ; however , many people have questions about the impact Crohn 's disease will have on a pregnancy . Women who have Crohn 's disease may be concerned about whether or not they have the physical capacity to carry a pregnancy to term , while men with Crohn 's disease may worry whether medication has affected the viability of their sperm.Will we be able to conceive a baby ? Women with an active case of Crohn 's disease may have difficulty conceiving . Men who use sulfasalazine , a commonly used drug to treat Crohn 's disease , may become temporarily infertile because the sulfa compound can decrease sperm production . If a man is trying to father a child , he should ask his physician about 5-ASA medications which can treat Crohn 's disease without risking fertility . Women with Crohn ’ s disease who are planning to become pregnant should consult a doctor.How can Crohn 's disease affect my pregnancy ? While most women with Crohn 's disease are able to carry a full-term pregnancy and deliver a healthy baby , it is important for you to know that your disease may affect your pregnancy in the following ways : A cesarean section may be required for some women who have Crohn 's disease with complications , including abscesses or fistulas of the rectum or vagina.If a woman is experiencing an active bout of Crohn 's disease during pregnancy she has a 2 to 3 times increased risk of miscarriage , delivering the baby prematurely , or stillbirth.If a woman has active Crohn 's disease at the time of conception , the disease usually runs its course in a similar way to the pattern that was experienced before pregnancy.If a woman is experiencing active Crohn 's disease prior to a pregnancy , she may notice that the symptoms of her disease worsen right after becoming pregnant and during the first 3 months of the pregnancy . The disease may also intensify right after the delivery of her baby . It 's important to remember that every pregnancy is different . There is no evidence showing that if you experience severe symptoms during your pregnancy , subsequent pregnancies will also be difficult.Should I change my diet now that I am pregnant ? It is important for all pregnant women to eat a healthy and well-balanced diet . As a woman with Crohn 's disease , in addition to eating a standard diet recommended during pregnancy , your obstetrician and gastroenterologist may also recommend some special foods , vitamins , and minerals . If your Crohn 's disease is being treated with sulfasalazine , it is important that your diet be supplemented with folic acid , since this is an essential nutrient in preventing certain birth defects.Are medications for Crohn 's disease safe to take during my pregnancy ? All women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant should avoid taking any unnecessary medications . However , if you are experiencing active Crohn 's disease , it may be necessary for you to be treated with medication.If you ’ re a pregnant woman and considering drug therapy , you should speak with both your gastroenterologist and your obstetrician , so that each healthcare provider is well informed about current health issues when recommending treatment options.Are any diagnostic tests safe during pregnancy ? All pregnant women should avoid having X-rays , especially during the first 12 weeks , unless it is absolutely necessary . Presently , MRIs are sometimes used , but more information is needed . The following tests may also be used for pregnant women who may have Crohn 's disease for the management of their disease : Abdominal ultrasoundSigmoidoscopyRectal biopsyUpper endoscopyColonoscopyWill previous surgery for Crohn 's disease affect my pregnancy ? There is no evidence that a bowel resection due to Crohn 's disease affects a woman 's pregnancy . The opposite actually",0

"What is the best diet pill for weight loss ? Good question . I will answer by first saying that diet pills are a fraud . Any pill that says you can lose weight by taking it and doing nothing else is wrong.Losing weight is not losing weight if you put it back on . That ’ s what diet pills do , why do you think there is a new popular one every few months.Now if you wonder if there are any good supplements and my answer is yes.There are some supplements that you can take that can enhance a very healthy diet and fitness program and help you to stay committed to it . 7 Keto is an awesome metabolic enhancing compound that helps to reduce body weight and body fat by giving you more of a hormone that tells your thyroid to increase your metabolism . You may say wow , that ’ s what I need . No , the 7-Keto is all you need , not the other stuff . Yes but no , see the body can only take so much of it at a time before its eliminated by the blood and the rest becomes expensive urine . So you cant just take it alone , it must be part of a plan.Hoodia appears to affect the brain by making the stomach feel full and reducing the desire to eat . Offers safe , caffeine-free , non-stimulant weight management support . It also may help in metabolizing fats.Multivitamins - help you maintain the muscle that you have by providing nutrients your cells need . Understand if you don ’ t put enough nutrients in your body , you will lose muscle because your body will eat the muscle for those nutrients.These supplements should be part of an overall lifestyle change , to a healthier one.There are 5 most important things that must go together in any workout program . These are part of changing your complete lifestyle to one that is healthier . They also help you to naturally optimize your metabolism . The faster your metabolism the better your body uses your food for energy , instead of storing it as fat . I put them in the order of importance.1 . Eat more . Yes eat more . More meals that is . It is best to eat a small meal every 3-4 hours . The meal should be just large enough to where you are not hungry , as opposed to eating you are full . There is a difference . Eating 1 or 2 meals a day slows your metabolism down . You should have at least 4-6 meals a day . For most people , your food should be balanced between carbs proteins and fats in a 50-25-25 ratio . Throughout your day you should maintain this ratio 2 . Drink more water . Most of us don ’ t have enough water . This means our bodies are dehydrated . Two things a dehydrated body has trouble doing , one is releasing water . In order to lose fat you must be able to release water , because fat cells in your body are composed of mostly water . A dehydrated body can not build very well . Muscle tone indicates a constant building state in your body . If your body isn ’ t building that means it is losing muscle and it ’ s never good to lose muscle that slows your metabolism and makes you look flabby.3 . Maintain a balanced workout regimen of cardio and resistance ( weights ) . Cardio is good for fat burning and it ’ s easy to do and to progress yourself . Resistance is a little harder because it ’ s not as easy to know what to do . If weights aren ’ t your thing then try Yoga or Pilates . Both are very effective resistance and core training and can help you maintain lean muscle and increase your overall metabolism.4 . Smart supplementation of your diet is your best solution to making sure you get the nutrients your food doesn ’ t give you . I mentioned 7-Keto , Hoodia , and a multivitamin plus cleanse formulas , as well as detox formulas are awesome for eliminating toxins we take into our bodies without knowing.5 . Sleep is a very important part of any healthy lifestyle regimen . When we sleep our bodies and minds refresh themselves and allow us to function at an optimal level . Sleeping allows muscles to rebuild themselves and when they do that , it speeds your metabolism.You may ask why I gave you this long list instead of just telling you what exercises",0

"As a Christian , how do you find balance between ... . ( see the details ) ? In my life , God has put a large number of persons in my life from a vast array of Christian Cults ... some whom I know and love very much . However , I find it very difficult to deal with this group of people . I accept people of separate belief systems without this challenge . Mostly , because Christian cults are preaching something that parallels Christian beliefs , but unfortunately is still wrong . I feel the sense of urgency to debunk what they are saying so as to prevent the young and impressionable ( in the Faith , etc ) from falling in their trap and being lost . Yet , Jesus tells us not to throw the Gospel at these people to be trampled upon . Where is the balance in this ? Anyone found a useful text or exercise on this ? Obviously Prayer and reading the Word come first ! Any particular scriptures you find helpful ? Anyone else had to deal much with these troubles ? I would love to hear from Schneb on this if anyone has him on speed dial . : -p People mean well ( though they do harm ) when they approach potential converts to Christianity by , abrasively , reminding them of their sinful standard of living.In the beginning of witnessing such 'ministering , ' my reaction was vexation of spirit because Jesus was never harsh with hurting people . The woman caught in adultery was not condemned by Jesus.When people surrounded her to carry out the brutal punishment of death by stoning , I can only imagine the fear of having a crowd of people on a mission to kill me for bad judgment ... for a bad call ... for a bad ( correctable ) choice . I can also imagine her relief to hear the noise of the crowd diminish as they listened to a lone , quiet voice of hope ( gently calling attention to their times of bad judgment ) and how they escaped punishment.True believers have to be that lone voice of hope , ( that balance ) to potential new converts subjected to the noise of those who do not minister in meekness . Paul stated in I Timothy 2:24 `` And the servant of the Lord must not strive ; but be gentle unto all men , apt to teach , patient , :25 In meekness instructing those who oppose themselves ; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth ; :26 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil , who are taken captive by him at his will . `` Therefore , as a Christian , when my thoughts lean toward harsh rebuke of those who mean well ( but do harm in their zealous ministry ) , I understand they need more instruction on how to minister in meekness . Lifting them in prayer and supplication to God ( that they become more sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit ) grants me peace from the torment of a vexed spirit .",0

We didnt perform any oral sex though last night but we have in the past few weeks . I just wanted to know , if it 's possible that I caught anything ( even though she was a virgin ) . STD or HIV ? one last note : A girl performed oral sex on me last december ( early december ) . Does that influence anything ? Thank you in advance If your girl is a virgin and she has not been infected by any STD by sharing needles or bad blood transfusion you 're not going to catch anything from her.You can receive an STD by Salival transmission so if the girl who went down on you has an STD you may have received it.Remember that life is an STD . If you 're having unprotected vaginal sex you need to make sure you are at a point in your life where you 'll be able to support a child . If you 're not then you should take every precaution against pregnancy . Remember that the only method that is 100 % effective is abstinence ( well and oral I guess ) .",0

"How do you start looking for Venture Capital Funding ? For an online company , located in a small rural area , that has been in business for over 5 years , how does one go about attracting venture capital funds and investors ? Venture Capital is just another name for private investor . There are some private investor groups but they are not well advertised . Typically a venture capitalist does not engage in the business of private investing because there is usually no or very little return on the investment . They expect to get their money back at best . That 's why it is hard to find them , it 's not a business . However , there are some organizations that provide business resources , councilling , consulting , advice , and these are usually staffed by successful business people . The chamber of commerce in your city and the state will provide you with local information . Often , those groups will point you in the right direction for fund raising . Another resource is to join a country club and/or a golf club where business executives tend to favor . Networking is key to many aspects of business success .

"What happenes if you default on a 401K loan ? If you fail to pay your 401k loan , then you are taxed on it as if you would have taken a regular distribution . ( Tax + Penalty for early distribution ) .The amount that you owe is deducted from your total 401k amount.For example . If you take a 401k loan for $ 1000 , and you have $ 3000 in your 401k and you quit your job , then the $ 1000 is deducted from your $ 3000 leaving you with a $ 2000 401k total.The $ 1000 is also treated like a `` distribution '' . In other words , it 's treated like an early withdrawal . So at the end of the year , you owe a 43 % penalty on the $ 1000 , or $ 430 in taxes . ( 33 % income tax [ or whatever your income tax rate is ] , 10 % penalty ) .Further more , since that $ 1000 is treated like regular income , it may push you into a higher tax bracket .",0

"shouldnt some1 apologize to their father if they said dat they arent their father nomore ? my b/f is in some shit withj his father bcus 1 day he and his father went to the store and started arguing and his father threw a shopping cart at his bad knee and he punched his father in the face that was his reaction . another day which was new years day they seen each other but they didnt bother to tell each other happy new years to each other and now hes sayin that his father can kiss his ass but now hes sayin that he regrets sayin all that stuff to him bcus he forgot thathis father has a heart problem shouldnt he apologize ? bcus i tell him to stop sayin all those mean things to his father bcus he only has 1 but he dont wan na listen to nobody . but theres more he cusses out his grandmother but ill te ; ll you about that 2morrow i have to go to cheerleading practice tryouts . peace babygirl it 's easy just to say the right thing to do is to apologize , which it is , but it 's not that easy for someone with an abusive father like that . this all goes much deeper than any outsider looking in would see . so you can encourage him to say he 's sorry , but as long as his Dad 's not gon na change it may not do any good for their relationship . But deffinately encourage him to apologize . like you said , you only have one dad , and he could lose him at any time .",0

"What is the real % of possibilities of getting aids from oral sex in case there are no obvious wounds ? The risk of becoming infected with HIV through unprotected ( without a condom ) oral sex is lower than that of unprotected anal or vaginal sex . However , a lower-risk activity will increase in risk when it is done often enough . The Options Project found that 7.8 % ( 8 of 102 ) of recently infected men who have sex with men in San Francisco were probably infected through oral sex . Nearly half ( 3 of 8 ) of these cases reported oral problems , including occasional bleeding gums . Almost all ( 7 of 8 ) of these men reported to have had oral contact with pre-semen or semen.The risk of oral sex transmission ( 8 % ) in this study is higher than many researchers had previously thought or found in other studies . More media attention appeared to be placed on this particular study , probably because of the higher number of study participants . There appears to be evidence that higher-risk activities ( anal sex ) among men who have sex with men is decreasing while lower-risk activities ( oral sex ) among these men is increasing . Oral sex has always been considered a lower-risk activity but is certainly not risk free .",0

"What is everything you know about the VIETNAM WAR. ? i need everything and anything you know or may come across . thanks . Basically , it was a failure ( like today 's war in Iraq ) and many American soldiers ' lives were lost.The Vietnam War or Second Indochina War 1 was a conflict between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( DRVN , or North Vietnam ) , allied with the National Liberation Front ( NLF , or `` Viet Cong '' ) against the Republic of Vietnam ( RVN , or South Vietnam ) , and its allies — notably the United States military in support of the South , with US combat troops involved from shortly after the Korean War until the official withdrawal in 1975.After France 's attempted recolonization of Indochina was defeated in 1954 by the Viet Minh at the battle of Điện Biên Phủ , an agreement to temporarily partition the country in two with a de-militarized zone ( DMZ ) was reached at the Geneva Conference ( 1954 ) . The `` Vietnam War '' ostensibly began as a civil war between feuding governments . Being Western-oriented and far less popular than Hồ Chí Minh 's northern rebellion , the South Vietnam government fought largely to maintain its governing status within the partitioned entity , rather than to `` unify the country '' as was the goal of the North . Fighting began in 1957 and with U.S. and Soviet-Chinese involvement would steadily escalate and spill over into the neighboring Indochinese countries of Cambodia and Laos.The Geneva partition was not a natural division of Vietnam and was not intended to create two separate countries . But the South government , with the support of the United States , blocked the Geneva scheduled elections for reunification . In the context of the Cold War , and with the recent Korean War as a precedent , the U.S. had feared that a reunified Vietnam would elect a Communist government under the popular Hồ Chí Minh . South Vietnam and its Western allies portrayed the conflict as based in a principled opposition to communism —to deter the expansion of Soviet-based control throughout Southeast Asia , and to set the tone for any likely future superpower conflicts . The North Vietnamese government and its Southern dissident allies ( NLF ) viewed the war as a struggle to reunite the country and to repel a foreign aggressor —a virtual continuation of the earlier war for independence against the French.After fifteen years of protracted fighting and massive civilian and military casualties , major direct U.S. involvement ended with the signing of the Paris Peace Accords in 1973 . Fighting between Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) forces against the dominant combined People 's Army of Vietnam ( PAVN ) and NLF forces would soon bring an end to the RVN and the war . With the Northern victory , the country was unified as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam ( SRV ) with a communist-controlled government based in the new capital Hanoi.This is just a brief summary . For more information on the Vietnam War , go to : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War",0

"An ounce of high grade pot can have a street value higher than an ounce of gold . Why not legalize and tax ? It is less harmful than liquor and tobbacco . I could not possibly agree more with you . People are so reluctant to legalize marijuana because it has such a bad reputation . Of course , it gets that reputation because it is illegal and people pass judgment on it based solely on that fact . If you stop looking at the actual legality of it and just think about it morally it is a vice no worse than many others that americans find perfectly acceptable . Anything can be abused . People abuse alcohol , cigarettes , fast food , gambling and countless things which are perfectly legal and socially acceptable , but somehow so many people think smoking weed is just wrong.I can hardly see how continuing to make it illegal will benefit anyone . It only allows drug dealers to set the standards of production/regulation etc . all the while evading taxes . Making it illegal probably does not really curtail the use of the drug either . Did prohibition curtail the use of alcohol ? nope . did it increase crime ? yes.Legalize it and regulate it . Everyone wins . The potheads wo n't have to worry about getting locked up . The government can make some more cash . And we wo n't continue to whaste our time prosecuting potheads and enforcing rediculous laws that combat marijuana use at the expense of taxpayer 's dollars.aside from these reasons , weed just is n't that bad . It is not physically addictive ( as is alcohol/tobacco ) , it does not have the reputation of making people violent/abusive ( as does alcohol ) , it is not as closely associated with recklessness ( as is alcohol ) and when was the last time you threw up or had a hangover from smoking some weed ? never.Legalize it ! !",0

"how to concentrate a UV light to a coherent light ? this question does n't make sense ( it 's incoherent HAH ! sorry.. corny joke . ) light from a light bulb is called incoherent light because it 's made up of many different waves . waves as you know have a property called phase , which tells you where along the wave-front you are at a given position and time . incoherent light is a mixture of light waves with random phases.coherent light on the other hand , is used to describe light where all of the waves have the same phase - so the waves peak and trough at exactly the same time and position . coherent light is much more intense than incoherent light because all of the phase fronts add up constructively , and so you end up with a very large amplitude wave.so , if you `` concentrate '' UV light , by using a lens or some other sort of focusing device , it will be more intense than the spread-out light , but it wo n't be coherent . the only way to get coherent light is at the source - for instance , an excimer laser can be tuned to emit in the ultraviolet , and the light will be coherent . there is no ( known ) way to convert incoherent light into coherent light , though that 's not to say it 's impossible - such a thing just has n't been invented .",0

"Why do people not help others as a matter of course ? If I meet someone , and they need help of some kind , I do everything in my power to help them . Others will say 'I 'm too busy , ' or 'That 's their problem ' . What has happened to the world ? It has sadly become far too focused on itself . If you need more proof , just take a look around at the number of people engaged in a cell phone conversation in public.It seems to me our entire culture has turned in on itself , making it ever more convenient to separate ourselves from the world . Technology has become a double-edged sword , providing us with amazing new ways to be more productive and organized , but often at the expense of human interaction . Communicaton and entertainment devices provide us with amazing mobility , but our Blackberrys and iPods only further cut us off from one another.Of course , technology is n't the whole problem . Our culture has also become incredibly jaded and disenfranchised , always expecting the worst from others and usually getting it . We use childish , egotistical athletes as role models , making life all about `` getting paid '' . Our fascination with celebrity has become an obsession -- just check out the ratings for `` reality '' shows . And our domestic and international political views are too often shaped by sound bites and media talking heads . Apparently it 's just easier to agree with someone than figure it out yourself.I do n't believe it has to be like this . Our technological advancements do n't have to come with a price that devalues our very existence . And we do not just have to accept that the world with all its troubles is simply beyond redemption . We simply have to want to be involved in the lives of others . How do we do that ? Parents have to care more about their kids ' relationships with others ( not to mention their own ) than they do about making sure they 're doing the right things . We have to educate on how to use technology to collaborate , instead of to isolate . We have to look harder for our heroes . Let 's face it -- the one thing 9/11 taught Americans was who they really were . In short , we all have to love ourselves and life and be obsessed about them less .",0

"Which is the first bank in the world ? Probably religious temples . Jesus tried to deal with them , but they 're still here .

Their owners justly felt that temples were the safest places to store their gold as they were constantly attended , well built and were sacred , thus detering would-be thieves . There are extant records of loans from the 18th Century BC in Babylon that were made by temple priests to merchants . ''",0
"Is LeBron James the next Michael Jordan ? Both number 23 ... Well , the thing that made Jordan great was not his skills . Yes he was a great player ( possibly one of the top two along with Wilt Chamberlain ) , he was a complete player . He could do everything excellently . He scored 30 points per game , grabbed over 5 boards , 3-4 assits , 2-3 steals , and even one season averaged a block per game . He was an all-around excellent player . There are other players even in his era who had just as many skills and were just as talented with natural ability . Scottie Pippen I think had more natural potential as was more graceful . Certainly Dominique Wlikens was more powerful.The thing that made Jordan great was his intelligence and his primacy ; his ability to get up for a game and take it to the next level . He thrived on pressure . He could get into another players head and totally shut them down from the inside out . When the game was on the line he took the game to another emotional level that had so much stress and pressure to it that every other opposing player was crushed by it and all his teammates fed off of it . Jordan 's natural talent was limited . He was n't even picked for his high school team the first time around . Lebron only went to high school . He is not mentally the same player as Jordan , and he never will be .",0

Ok , I 'm a boy , but hope this will give you a hint . For Valentine , chocolate is a must . If that is not enough , accompany the chocolate with other things , like wine , candy , or cards . You can even give an overkill expensive chocolate , like a branded-brandy-chocolate.Actually , it will be better if you make the chocolate by yourself ( you better make it delicious ) , but I think boy just ca n't do it . If you can , however , make it ( and make it sweet , as sweet as your love ) ! ! Btw , do n't make it sweet if you know that your GF really HATES sweet ^_^ ...

"Why US try to develop a democratic power in IRAQ when they will never be a democratic nation ? Who is to say that IRAQ will not be a democratic nation . Even the USSR was democratic in the truest sense and meaning of the word , the people could vote , problem was there was only one person they could vote for.Oil has NOTHING to do with the war in IRAQ . I wo n't even get into why but the war would be in Saudi Arabia where the oil reserves are over twice the size of Iraq.We need to look back in history to see what has happened and the future looks bright for IRAQ . Success in Central America , Liberia , Korea , the new Russia , the slavic regions , and others have formed some type of democracy.The `` democracy '' that other countries enjoy are definately not the same as ours , but even a Monarchy like Morocco has a democratic government.Success in IRAQ will indeed depend on whether democracy becomes the new form of government when America finally does pull out or if there will be political chaos and insergency.Time will only tell.To correct a couple of the other writers above me ... The United States is NOT a democratic country , it is a Federal Republic . If indeed we were a true democracy Gore would be president not George Bush ( Gore won more of the popular vote but less of the electoral vote ) . So to say the US is the most democratic country in the world is absurd . Correct me if I am wrong but there is no country in the world that is truely democratic .",0

"how do you get rid of pregnancy nausea ? Cinnamon tea , an old herbal remedy may help and it does not cost much to try it if you like and can drink cinnamon tea . Steep 2 � tablespoon cinnamon bark or powder in boiling water for ten minutes . Strain , add honey to taste and drink � cup three times a day before meals . You may also buy herbal cinnamon tea bags available at most supermarket.Pregnancy is such an exciting time in life , but for some it is marred by the discomfort of morning sickness or nausea . This is most unpleasant at best and if severe , dehydration can cause multiple problems . None of this is necessary as there is an effective way to relieve the nausea with Myofascial Trigger Point Therapy ( Applied pressure to trigger points in a muscle area ) .Although it has not been proven , the ongoing theory is that hormonal changes trigger spasm in the Pyloric Sphincter ( the muscle surrounding the opening that leaves the stomach ) . Because Myofascial Trigger Point Therapy can relieve muscle spasms of all sorts , it can also relieve the Pyloric Sphincter spasm causing morning sickness , known in the medical field as Hyperemesis Gravidarum . The nausea can start about the 4th week of pregnancy up until the 12th week and for some into the 2nd trimester.However , I have discovered an easy method to eliminate morning sickness . During this stage , the trigger points in the Pyloric Sphincter area are very tender , usually painful and just too uncomfortable to put pressure on one self ; therefore you will need a friend or your husband to help you . You may feel nauseated right afterwards but do not feel discouraged there will be relief a bit later . You may need to repeat this every 3 hours if the nausea returns . If the trigger points are too tender to repeat every 3 hours , repeat every 6 hours . This way you can at least get some food and fluids down to maintain good nutrition.If the nausea is severe , try eating only food , ( omitting liquids ) at meal times and take your fluids between meals . Milk just brought to the boil and then refrigerated is quite pleasant and a good food source.Let me explain why it works and how I discovered it . I am a Registered Nurse and have worked many years in the anti-partum unit at a good size hospital in Orange County . This unit treats patients with difficult pregnancies . One of the common problems is dehydration due to severe nausea called Hyperemesis Gravidarum . Most doctors prescribe intravenous fluids and medication for nausea . This does not always work and the nausea and vomiting often continues which puts the patient in a starvation situation forcing the treating doctor to order Hyper alimentation fluid . A complete nutritional fluid given intravenously that costs approximately $ 500 a bag and is given over a twenty-four hour period . The patient is still nauseated and vomiting but is fed nutritionally and may need this feeding for 2 to 3 weeks and sometimes more.Now I found that if I used an easy method of helping the pregnant mom and taught her husband how to help his wife , when she was first admitted and given some intravenous fluid she would go home in a day or two . However if I was not on duty and and the patient had been started on the Hyper alimentation fluid , my method did not seem effective . The patient would still suffer nausea although she would receive adequate nutrition.So if you are pregnant , fear nausea and want to make sure you feel good all the time and not have to go through all this hospital suffering , you may want to print this health tip . Have your husband help with the procedure even before you experience nausea , just as a preventative measure.NOTE : This procedure may also bring some very quick relief from gastric problems when they are caused by spasm of the Pyloric Sphincter.FOLLOW THIS EASY METHOD : Xiphoid Process.gif ( 7811 bytes ) 1 ) Have the mother lie flat on her back with her helper to one side.2 ) Start two inches below the Xiphoid Process which is the bottom tip of the S",0

"Best way to get into Voice Over work ? Where in the name of heaven do I find job postings for voice over work ? It seems to be a very insular community . Is the only `` in '' through taking high-priced classes ? Maybe I do n't know the best way , but my father is a Voice Actor , and is very successful . He offers great work shops in the L.A. area and often takes serious aspiring voice actors under his wing . I 've noticed that in his field there are some tricks . 1 . Of course you have to have a good agent . He works with a well known agency . 2 . You have to understand the trends of the business . When I was younger , he worked on a lot of cartoons like Duck Tales , Gummi Bears , Bearnstien Bears , Snorks , and a bunch of other ones . But these days , the younger voices seem to be a trend . He has had to tailor his work in a new way to get into the right realm of voice acting again . Good thing he has a great agent . 3 . This is the most important in my opinion . You have to be honest and HARD WORKING . I noticed that a lot of people in entertainment are ego-centric . They wo n't take a job unless it has a great image attached to it . When my father got his job , he took any and every job he could get . The side product was that he became extremely good at it . He has more practice than anybody , and he now bears the nick-name `` one-take Brian '' to most of his collegues in Hollywood . So when a commercial is done and they need to lay the VO tracks on the video ... he 's the man they call in crunch time because they know he 'll get it done fast . He saves sound engineers money on reduced studio time too . So I guess hard work and integrity pay off in a business where there 's a lot of less honest and less hard working people . It 's a great business and he loves it . It 's very lucrative for him too . However , I 've seen a lot of people fail at it . Get out there.. make demos , get your name known , practice your trade , and take what you can get . I hope it works out . If you live in the L.A. area and are interested in a good contact or his workshops , contact me . He has a good repetoire of well known roles and he knows most of the famous Voice Actors out there from Jim Cummings to Gary Owens .",0

"can someone explain the cell cycle to me in english please ... . ? my bio teacher makes no sense at alll ... . The cell cycle , or cell division cycle , is the cycle of events in a eukaryotic cell from one cell division to the next . It consists of interphase , mitosis , and usually cell division . The cell cycle is regulated by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases . Leland H. Hartwell , R. Timothy Hunt , and Paul M. Nurse won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of these central molecules in the regulation of the cell cycle.The phases of the cell cycle are : The G0 phase is a period in the cell cycle where cells exist in a quiescent state . The G1 phase is the first growth phase . S phase , during which the DNA is replicated , where S stands for the Synthesis of DNA . G2 phase is the second growth phase , also the preparation phase for the cell . M phase or mitosis and cytokinesis , the actual division of the cell into two daughter cells . A surveillance system , so-called `` checkpoints '' , monitor the cell for DNA damage and failure to perform critical processes . Checkpoints can block progression through the phases of the cell cycle if certain conditions are not met . For instance , there is a checkpoint which monitors DNA replication and keeps cells from proceeding to mitosis before DNA replication is completed . Similarly , the spindle checkpoint blocks the transition from metaphase to anaphase within mitosis if not all chromosomes are attached to the mitotic spindle.If this system senses a problem , a network of signaling molecules instructs the cell to stop dividing . They can let the cell know whether to repair the damage or initiate programmed cell death , a form of which is called apoptosis . Programmed cell death ensures that the damaged cell is not further propagated . For example , a certain protein , called p53 , acts to accept signals provoked by DNA damage . It responds by stimulating the production of inhibitory proteins that then halt the DNA replication process . Without proper p53 function , DNA damage can accumulate unchecked . A direct consequence is that the damaged gene progresses into a cancerous state . Today , defects in p53 are associated with a variety of cancers , including some breast and colon cancers.Some cells , such as neurons , never divide once they become locked in a G0 phase . However , recent data has shown that neurons undergoing cell death re-enter the cell cycle . Addition of cell cycle inhibitors prevent this type cell death called apoptosis .",0

"Alabama and education for children with pdd-nos / Autism ? I assume you are asking about what education is available for children with the disorder in Alabama . I am not familiar with Alabama 's resources but as a parent of a profoundly mentally challenged child , I will tell you what I do know . The best place to start is ask your pediatrician about resources . The mental health facility is a very good place to start . Depending on the child 's age , your area may have something available like First Steps , which is an early intervention service for children with developmental delays available for children up to 3 years old . First Steps was wonderful for my daughter . After she turned 3 , we were referred to a state-run facility that basically gave us a case manager and helped to identify the special needs for our child but after 3 years with them , we still have not been able to actually RECEIVE services because the waiting list is so long , then they go through freezes . I hope your state is not as backed up as ours is . As far as education , public schools are required to provide an education to special needs children , per the Americans with Disabilities Act . The special needs child is given an IEP ( individualed education plan ) so that the child is taught what is appropriate for his/her abilities . The parent 's involvement and input in the IEP is very important . If you do not agree with the IEP , you can change it . Individuals with Disabilities Education Act : The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) ( formerly called P.L . 94-142 or the Education for all Handicapped Children Act of 1975 ) requires public schools to make available to all eligible children with disabilities a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment appropriate to their individual needs.IDEA requires public school systems to develop appropriate Individualized Education Programs ( IEP 's ) for each child . The specific special education and related services outlined in each IEP reflect the individualized needs of each student.IDEA also mandates that particular procedures be followed in the development of the IEP . Each student 's IEP must be developed by a team of knowledgeable persons and must be at least reviewed annually . The team includes the child 's teacher ; the parents , subject to certain limited exceptions ; the child , if determined appropriate ; an agency representative who is qualified to provide or supervise the provision of special education ; and other individuals at the parents ' or agency 's discretion.If parents disagree with the proposed IEP , they can request a due process hearing and a review from the State educational agency if applicable in that state . They also can appeal the State agency 's decision to State or Federal court . For more information , contact : Office of Special Education ProgramsOffice of Special Education and Rehabilitative ServicesU.S . Department of Education400 Maryland Avenue , S.W.Washington , D.C. 20202-7100I hope this helps . I know how hard it is with a special needs child and I wish you the best .

Can you insert a minidisc into an Imac G5 ? Depends on what you call a minidisc .

"how can you really really lose your baby fat ? i am 180 pds and 5ft3ins taller that is to much weight on me after i had my 4 kids i blew up try tabooWHAT to eat for losing weight• Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables , especially NC ( negative calorie ) food . * Print these lists . They will be your ... `` Bible '' , from now on ! * Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads . Also ognion + garlic . * Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits ( whenever possible , of course ) * If you really want a book , then check this out : The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook ( Win95/98 only ) . Read more about this e-book here.• Eat fish , chicken , beef , pork . ( preferences are in this order ) * If you are a vegetarian , then ignore this ! * Avoid fat meat• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day . Do n't EVER exclude bread from your diet ! • Snacks between meals ( if needed ) : apples , oranges , grepfruits and other NC fruits* Do n't cheat ... NO cookies , chips , candies , brownies etc ! * EVEN if they have `` low fat '' indication ... They might have low fat , yet they can have lots of CALORIES ! ! ! • About rice , potatoes , beans , [ xxx ] nuts , pastry , pasta ... you know ! * Do n't eat too much of those , at least during the first weeks of the diet . I 'm not a low carb addict , but I 've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities , especially when associated with other foods . * If you like them a lot , try and eat them like one meal . A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch ( never dinner ! ) , followed by a nice big apple . These rich starch foods are not good for dinner ! * At dinner time , chose mainly large mixed veggies salads ... with fish , lean meat or cheese ( if you are not a vegetarian ) . if u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it . no salt no nothing just plain . u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound . i heard that from a weight loss tape . the best drink is water or gatorade . thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo . if u want a macine . run with dumbells on a treadmill . u could do the rocky workout . but thats a new story . u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs1 ) It is not just the amount you eat , but what you eat . Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start . And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.2 ) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day . Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored . The other half of the time use weights , or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle `` burn '' . A gym is also an option , but I do n't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.3 ) Sleep well . To bed earlier and up earlier . Exercise in the morning when you wake up , not in the evening before bed . 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.4 ) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time . A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.That is a good place to start ... if you see good results , keep it up and modify to fit you ... if it does not , see a doctor AND a trainer Keep working out , drink water a lot , eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities , vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice , fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours , minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important , your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hoursthe most important thing is you do n't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you wantyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.comgood luck",0

He knows that , and worked miracles such as that to offer evidence of His true Nature.Heck , He tried to TALK and REASON with them and they still ran Him out of town on a rail ( or cross ! ) Some people still do n't believe in miracles because `` they ca n't be proven .

Biological classifications , however , aim at establishing natural groups ( i.e. , groups that reflect the genealogy or descent of the organisms ) .Systematics is sometimes used with the same meaning as taxonomy , but it is a broader concept that comprises the scientific study of the types and diversity of organisms and their interelationships ; other definitions are `` the science of biological classification '' or `` the science of organismal diversity '' .",0

"Which is the fastest computer in the world ? Well , there are three perspectives to your question , which are as follows : ( 1 ) A super computer ( 2 ) A desktop computer ( 3 ) Anything in a general sense that can compute.For the third perspective , The fastest computer in the world is much faster than the desktop in front of you , and it is sitting right on top of your shoulders ! The human brain is an amazing computing device and the fastest processor available right now . In supercomputers , the BlueGene/L - eServer Blue Gene Solution stationed at DOE/NNSA/LLNL at Livermore in California is ruling the world . It has , hold on your breath , 131072 processors , each processor with an individual performance of 2.8 GigaFlops ( PowerPC 440 700 MHz ) . It has a main memory of 32768 GB and is 3 times more powerful in processing than its immediate competitor ( Also by IBM ) . Surprisingly , its still in expansion phase . Blue Gene is an IBM Research project dedicated to exploring the frontiers in supercomputing : in computer architecture , in the software required to program and control massively parallel systems , and in the use of computation to advance our understanding of important biological processes such as protein folding.As for the fastest desktop configuration , it keeps changing every now and then . An interesting fact to note , Intel had come up with 4GHz chip , but could not commercialize it because of the excessive heating which could damage the chip . Hope to see such a chip soon . As on 6th January 2006 , Xi MTower 64 AGE-SLI is considered to be the fastest desktop Computer .

In particular , it focuses on the methodologies , techniques and tools that are the foundation of complex Web application development and which support their design , development , evolution , and evaluation . It is a relatively a new discipline.Web application development has certain characteristics that make it different from traditional software , information system , or computer application development.Web engineering is multidisciplinary and encompasses contributions from diverse areas : systems analysis and design , software engineering , hypermedia/hypertext engineering , requirements engineering , human-computer interaction , user interface , information engineering , information indexing and retrieval , testing , modelling and simulation , project management , and graphic design and presentation.Web engineering is not a clone or not a subset of software engineering , although both involve programming and software development . While Web Engineering uses software engineering principles , it encompasses new approaches , methodologies , tools , techniques , and guidelines to meet the unique requirements of Web-based.Main topics of Web engineering include , but are not limited to , the following areas : * Business Processes for Applications on the Web * CASE Tools for Web Applications * Code Generation for Web Applications * Collaborative Web Development * Conceptual Modelling of Web Applications ( aka .

"Which is the world 's oldest religion ? ? The world 's oldest religion , atleast chronologically from a historic perspective is Hinduism ( Sanatana Dharma ) . However , please keep in mind that everyone of every religion considers their religion to not be 'new ' . Christianity is seen as a fulfillment of prophecies based in Judaism . Baha'i is based upon prophecies in Islam . So as far as Judaism , Christianity , Islam , and Baha'i , if you ask a member of this religion they can each point backwards through the Abrahamic traditions to how each 'fulfilled ' other areas , thus keeping them within the same line . THe same can be said of Buddhism , Jainism , Sikhism , etc . So when asking this question it is best to be aware of what exactly you are wanting to know . As one Christian I know said `` Jesus was a part of God in the begining , thus Christianity is the oldest religion because Jesus was always a part of God , but it is young if you only compare it from a historic chronological perspective . '' I think that is well said.Thus from a Historice Chronological Perspective from oldest to youngest the religions go : HinduismZoroastrianismJudaismJainismBuddhismTaoismConfucismShintoChristianityIslamSikhismBaha'iNeoPaganism*Please note that many in the NeoPagan movement claim direct connection to the Pagan past and often direct it to a specific ancient culture/civilization , but not all . Some state that theirs is a new religion based upon a revitalization of ancient religions , but not the ancient religions themselves . So one has to be careful in this area , too . Native American beliefs and Shamanism are not listed , nor did I name Unitarian-Universalism , Rastafarianism , etc . I mainly listed major world religions . ( UUs do not necessarily view themselves as a religion in itself , but rather an approach to religion with many in a UU congregation holding a wide variety of beliefs from many of the worlds religions . There are some UU , though , who would claim that as their religion so no offense to those who do ) .",0

"What 's the difference in modulo and remainders ? What 's the difference between the remainder and modulo in programming ? I know some languages use modulo while others use % . Remainder and modulo are really the same concept mathematically .

( 4 is divisible by 2 and is the largest whole number that is less than or equal to 5 ) .5 / 2 remainder is 1.5 modulo 2 is 1.5 % 2 is 1.One way of expressing this in some programming languages is : a = 5 , b = 2remainder = b * ( ( a / b ) - int ( a / b ) ) remainder = 2 * ( ( 5 / 2 ) - int ( 5 / 2 ) ) remainder = 2 * ( ( 2.5 ) - int ( 2.5 ) ) remainder = 2 * ( ( 2.5 ) - ( 2 ) ) remainder = 2 * ( 0.5 ) remainder = 1",0

"What exactly do stem cells do ? I 've come across a product that claims to promote the release of adult stem cells : what would be the benefit of that ? Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that can , under the right conditions , turn into any other kind of cell . They are of particular interest to scientists in that they may provide a means to replace damaged cells that the body can not naturally replaced ( in the spinal chord , for example ) . Stem cells are often talked about ( not inacurately ) in the context of curing numerous degenerative neurological conditions ( Parkinsons , Altzeimers , ALS , etc . ) as well as other conditions that can be traced to the malfunction of a particular type of cell ( they could be used , for example , to replace insuline-sectreteing cells in type I diabetes ) .Although I have not heard of a product like the one you mentioned , I would be inclined to say it does absolutely nothing . Stem cells are only useful if they can be made to differentiate and become a specific type the specific type of cell that is needed , where that type of cell is needed . Flooding the body with stem cells will not make that happen . My best guess is that it is an attempt to profit off the wide-spread association of the term `` stem cell '' with curing uncurable diseases and , by extention , with improved health in general .",0
"Has anyone heard of the `` sleep cure '' ? Supposedly it 's a means to lose a fair amount of weight over the course of a few days . You 're sedated and you wake up days later having lost 8-10 pounds . Real , or just some fictional fantasy that keeps cropping up in various books ? Sounds like some serious wishful thinking to me , combined with some misinterpreted observation.If you weigh yourself right before bed and then first thing in the morning , you will find that you 've lost a couple of pounds overnight . However , you 'll find by that evening that the weight is back.Makes it look like the best way to lose weight is to sleep , eh ? But it 's just water weight . You go to bed hydrated , you wake up dehydrated . Bummer.Sleeping for a few days may net you more weight loss , but some of that will be a loss in muscle ton , which will result in making it even harder to lose more weight and a good probability of gaining more weight than you lost.The best way to lose weight is to stop trying to lose weight . Instead , concentrate on improving your health . Yeah , yeah , exercise and eat right . * There 's a lot of details missing in those four words , but the gist is that any attempt to lose weight that does n't involve those activities are just ways of screwing your health for looks . The reason that I say stop trying to lose weight ? Weight is too complex a system to control reliably and any method that involves looking at a scale regularly will have a very good chance of just frustrating you to the point of giving up .",0

This object , opens up a connection to a Web server , transmits and receives data , then calls back the javascript on the page which was used to invoke it.What this means is that changes on the client side can communicate with the server , then dynamically update the client user interface without having to request a new Web page from the server.While this slightly complicates developing Web applications that use AJAX technologies ( which , by the way , is just a name given to the various technologies employed to use this methodology ) , it makes for a very smooth user experience since they are not constantly refreshing Web pages.AJAX applications give an appearance of a 'thick client ' application while still being a 'thin client ' ( i.e . application that runs in a Web browser . ) However , it is important to note that network communication is still going on in the background while the application is being used .",0
"why in dry cell , cathode is marked '+ ' while in car battery anode is marked '+ ' ? Polarity of electricity was specified long ago by Benjamin Frankline before there was a practical means of detecting electrons . He could have tossed a coin to specify + or - . The thought was that electricity would flow ( like water ) from + ( high ) to - ( low ) . Unfortunately it was discovered that electrons actually flow from - to + in an external wire , but it was too late and we live with convention now . In a way it really does n't matter as long as all circuit designers agree on the convention since we can not see electrons ; unless you are designing a vacuum tube ( etc . ) where electrons must physically flow from a heated element that boils them off to a grounded plate that collects them . Cathode is normally the negative pole .",0
"How do I know if my childs imagination is too extensive ? She is 3yrs old and has several imaginary friends , insists we feed her dolls our food at meals , and she is constantly making up stories about when she was older or a baby . I 'm beginning to think she 's losing touch with reality . While having an active imagination is no crime and certainly should n't alarm you as a parent , you might consider what these friends provide for your daughter . It seems like she has experienced some instability in life right now and if she is feeling detached from her father , then she may be concerned that you , her mother might also unexpectedly leave or disappear . She is only 3 and is limited on her ability to communicate and understand these abandoning feelings and may have created an abundance of imaginary friends because she knows she can count on them not leaving . She may not be able to say , `` Mommy , are you going to leave too ? '' But she can create a fantasy of dolls and imaginary friends that support and validate her feelings . So while I would n't say that you should seek clinical therapy for your 3 year old , I would suggest that a sincere heart to heart with your daughter , and some invested mommy time , you could really help your daughter reconnect to the real supports in her life , you ! Suggestion : Find a way to validate her feelings . Having a drawing party ! Allow her to draw , and invite her imaginary friends to draw also . Sit at a table that is age appropriate for her ( or sit on the floor ) and allow her to describe to you the drawings of all the friends , as well as her own drawing . You might suggest to her drawing a few pictures . Maybe one of `` our new house '' . Have another drawing of `` our family '' , and her school/friends , room or house . You will learn a lot from her and it will allow her practice in expressing her feelings to you , her mom , rather than dolls and friends . Find age appropriate ways of bonding with your daughter . I would love to hear what you try and how it turns out ! Good Luck ! emailjacquisoon @ yahoo.com",0

"how to computer work ? Here 's the simple version : Computers haveA brain ( CPU or central processing unit ) Memory StoragePeripheralsThe CPU is like an air traffic controller controlling all your requests and running all your programs.The Memory holds the programs - including your OS ( windows etc . ) and data temporarily for the CPU to access.Storage such as a hard disk drive holds information when it is too large or inconvenient to place in memory and when the computer is shut down.Peripherals : Keyboard , mouse , monitor , printer are what the computer uses to interact with the Human.The CPU manages all your interactions : running programs , copying files , surfing the web . It uses the resources it needs ( peripherals , memory , storage etc . ) to fulfill those requests . Imagine you have a private chef , who is locked in his own kitchen . You make a request to him . He produces the food and uses his resources , pots , pans ingredients , recipes etc . He 's like your CPU.It goes much further than that , but I hope that helps .",0

"Is drinking coffee bad for you ? Here are some of the benefits and risk of drinking coffee.BenefitsCoffee increases the effectiveness of pain killers—especially migraine medications—and can rid some people of asthma . Some of the beneficial effects may be restricted to one sex , for instance it has been shown to reduce the occurrence of gallstones and gallbladder disease in men . Coffee intake may reduce one 's risk of diabetes mellitus type 2 by up to half . While this was originally noticed in patients who consumed high amounts ( 7 cups a day ) , the relationship was later shown to be linear ( Salazar-Martinez 2004 ) .Coffee can also reduce the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver and prevent colon and bladder cancers . Coffee can reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma , a variety of liver cancer ( Inoue , 2005 ) . Also , coffee reduces the incidence of heart disease , though whether this is simply because it rids the blood of excess fat or because of its stimulant effect is unknown . At the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Washington , D.C. , on August 28 , 2005 , chemist Joe Vinson of the University of Scranton presented his analysis showing that for Americans , who as a whole do not consume large quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables , coffee represents by far the largest source of valuable antioxidants in the diet . [ 4 ] Coffee contains the anticancer compound methylpyridinium . This compound is not present in significant amounts in other food materials . Methylpyridinium is not present in raw coffee beans but is formed during the roasting process from trigonellin , which is common in raw coffee beans . It is present in both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee , and even in instant coffee . 6Coffee is also a powerful stimulant for peristalsis and is sometimes considered to prevent constipation ; it is also a diuretic.Many people drink coffee for its ability to increase short term recall and increase IQ . It also changes the metabolism of a person so that their body burns a higher proportion of lipids to carbohydrates , which can help athletes avoid muscle fatigue.Some of these health effects are realized by as little as 4 cups a day ( 24 U.S. fl oz , 700 mL ) , but others occur at 5 or more cups a day ( 32 U.S. fl oz or 0.95 L or more ) .Some controversy over these effects exists , since by its nature coffee consumption is associated with other behavioral variables . Therefore it has been variously suggested that the cognitive effects of caffeine are limited to those who have not developed a tolerance , or to those who have developed a tolerance and are caffeine-deprived.Practitioners in alternative medicine often recommend coffee enemas for `` cleansing of the colon '' due to its stimulus of peristalsis , although mainstream medicine has not proved any benefits of the practice.RisksMany notable effects of coffee are related to its caffeine content.Many coffee drinkers are familiar with `` coffee jitters '' , a nervous condition that occurs when one has had too much caffeine . Coffee can also increase blood pressure among those with high blood pressure , but follow-up studies showed that coffee still decreased the risk of dying from heart disease in the aggregate . Coffee can also cause insomnia in some , while paradoxically it helps a few sleep more soundly . It can also cause anxiety and irritability , in some with excessive coffee consumption , and some as a withdrawal symptom . There are also gender-specific effects , in some PMS sufferers it increases the symptoms , and it can reduce fertility in women , also it may increase the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women , and there may be risks to a fetus if a pregnant woman drinks 8 or more cups a day ( 48 U.S. fl oz or 1.4 L or more ) .A February 2003 Danish study of 18,478 women linked heavy coffee consumption during pregnancy to significantly increased risk of stillbirths ( but no significantly increased risk of infant death in the first year ) . `` The results",0

"What is an alpha male ? An alpha male or alpha female is the individual in the community whom the others follow and defer to . Humans and their nearest species-relatives , the chimpanzees , show deference to the alpha of the community by ritualized gestures such as bowing , allowing the alpha to walk first in a procession , or standing aside when the alpha challenges . Canines also show deference to the alpha pair in their pack , by allowing them to be the first to eat and , usually , the only pair to mate . Wolves are a well known example of this.The status of alpha is generally achieved by means of superior physical prowess . However in certain highly-social species such as the Bonobo apes , the alpha can use more indirect methods ( such as political alliances ) to oust the ruling alpha and take his/her place .",0

If you want to do this with her , lay out the ground rules in advance , get involved in a local swinger 's group , and realize that if she enjoys sex with somebody else , the odds of her leaving you are much , much higher if you swing because you are allowing her to 'shop around ' , so to speak . Most likely you want to do this so you can have sex with other women and are n't thinking about how jealous you could be if you see your wife enjoying sex with somebody else instead of you . She might also realize how unsatisfied she is by you and your marriage will suffer , especially when the other guy is much more experienced with pleasuring a woman and gives her orgasm after orgasm . Your odds of picking up various STDs will also increase . Remember that a condom will not protect against all of them , such as genital warts , and you could both end up unlucky recipients of STDs that you 'll carry the rest of your lives .

Im in iraq and now ive got probs . it will play 2d but not 3d games . thanks a bunch Hi , First , you have to check if your Direct X version is support by the game , most recent game need DirectX 9.0c which can be found at http : //www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/default.aspxIf you do n't have the most recent version , go download and install it . Even if you have the recent version , you can try reinstall it if the game does not work . You can also try to install the newest graphic card driver from your card manufacturer , in your case it is Intel [ http : //www.intel.com ] .Lastly , you can run a diagnostic check on your graphic card and see if the 3D rendering is working , if it did not , it 's time to get a new card.Hope these solve your problems.Best regards , Siau",0

"What if you are wrong ? Like the song says , What if you are wrong and Christ is the son of God who has died for you and is the only way to the Father . Are you be willing to take that risk without at least searching for the truth ? Is your eternity worth looking into ? But I am not wrong , unless you think the Bible is wrong ! And if the Bible is not wrong , then you should examine your beliefs , and you will come to the conclusion you should convert to Judaism.The place i look to see what i should believe , and to check against to see if other beliefs are wrong is the Bible , the Hebrew Scriptures , and when i check i check in the original Hebrew.Here is what it says , in contrast to Christianity : : : The Christian understanding is that the Messiah , Jesus , died for the sins of the people . The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin.But we are taught in our Torah that no one can die for the sins of another . In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this : Deuteronomy 24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death forthe fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin ( eesh b'chet-o yumatu ) .In Exodus 32:30-35 , Moses tries to offer himself to atone for the sins of the people . To be written out of Gd 's book , means to be written out of the Book of Life , which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People . Gd 's response is No , it does not work that way , each man dies for his own sin : Exodus 32:30-35 And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses said unto the people , Ye have sinned a great sin : and now I will go up unto the Etrnl ; perhaps I shall make an atonement for your sin . And Moses returned unto the Etrnl , and said , Oh , this people have sinned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold . Yet now , if thou wilt forgive their sin -- ; and if not , blot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written . And the Etrnl said unto Moses , Whosoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book . The whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea , that no one can die for someone else 's sin . Further , this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for Gd 's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd will forgive us.So , the Bible is clear , no one can die for the sins of another , and this means that Jesus can not die for anyone else 's sins.Christians also believe that one needs a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin , that one who does not have such a blood sacrifice will die in their sins , and go to hell , except for the sacrifice of Jesus.This , too , is UnBiblical . The Bible describes blood sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin in the Book of Leviticus . But it is in Leviticus itself , in the middle of the discussion of the sin sacrifices , that we are taught that we do not need a blood sacrifice to be forgiven for our sins . Offering a blood sacrifice was an expensive thing to do for the family offering the animal . Was forgiveness then , to be only for the rich ? No , because if one could not afford a blood sacrifice then one who sins could bring flour , which has no blood and no life as their sacrifice , and Gd forgave them ! Leviticus 5:11-13 ; But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering ; he shall put no oil upon it , neither shall he put any frankincense thereon : for it is a sin offering.Furthermore , read the Book of Jonah . In Jonah , the People of Ninevah do three things in order to be forgiven by Gd . They fast , they pray for forgiveness , and they stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgave them ! This is exactly what we do on Yom Kippur , we fast , we pray for forgiveness , and , hopefully , we stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good , and Gd forgives us . And what book do we read on Yom Kippur afternoon ? The Book of Jonah ! Jonah 3:7-10 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Ninevah , by the decree of the King and his noble",0

I have dated club owners of well known downtown clubs in Houston , and many other successfull business men . I am curently dating a pro baseball player.I was the type of girl that went for the looks right off the bat , only because i had to be physically attracted to a guy if I was going to date him . But since then I learned a very good lesson while dating all of those men . Looks are not everything . At least there not to me anymore . I now look at the guy in the inside . If you have a good sense of humor and your just a really positive person YOU WILL ATTRACT THE RIGHT TYPE OF GIRLS . That a good guy like you should want . A good honest decent girl who wants a man that has a heart and a good head on his shoulders . you need to stop looking at what you dont have and focus on what you do have , all of your good qualities . I love a guy that is confident and knows that what he has to offer a lady is more then just looks . Appearence is not everything . Good luck in finding that girl and keep me posted .

"whats the origin of HIV/AIDS ? It is now generally accepted that HIV is a descendant of a Simian Immunodeficiency Virus because certain strains of SIVs bear a very close resemblance to HIV-1 and HIV-2 , the two types of HIV.HIV-2 for example corresponds to SIVsm , a strain of the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus found in the sooty mangabey ( also known as the green monkey ) , which is indigenous to western Africa.The more virulent strain of HIV , namely HIV-1 , was until recently more difficult to place . Until 1999 , the closest counterpart that had been identified was SIVcpz , the SIV found in chimpanzees . However , this virus still had certain significant differences from HIV.It has been known for a long time that certain viruses can pass between species . Indeed , the very fact that chimpanzees obtained SIV from two other species of ape shows just how easily this crossover can occur . As animals ourselves , we are just as susceptible . When a viral transfer between animals and humans takes place , it is known as zoonosis.Below are some of the most common theories about how this 'zoonosis ' took place , and how SIV became HIV in humans : The 'Hunter ' Theory The most commonly accepted theory is that of the 'hunter ' . In this scenario , SIVcpz was transferred to humans as a result of chimps being killed and eaten or their blood getting into cuts or wounds on the hunter . Normally the hunter 's body would have fought off SIV , but on a few occasions it adapted itself within its new human host and become HIV-1 . The fact that there were several different early strains of HIV , each with a slightly different genetic make-up ( the most common of which was HIV-1 group M ) , would support this theory : every time it passed from a chimpanzee to a man , it would have developed in a slightly different way within his body , and thus produced a slightly different strain.An article published in The Lancet in 20043 , also shows how retroviral transfer from primates to hunters is still occurring even today . In a sample of 1099 individuals in Cameroon , they discovered to ten ( 1 % ) were infected with SFV ( Simian Foamy Virus ) , an illness which , like SIV , was previously thought only to infect primates . All these infections were believed to have been acquired through the butchering and consumption of monkey and ape meat . Discoveries such as this have lead to calls for an outright ban on bushmeat hunting to prevent simian viruses being passed to humans.The Oral Polio Vaccine ( OPV ) theory Could production of the oral polio vaccine have contributed to the spread of HIV ? Some other rather controversial theories have contended that HIV was transferred iatrogenically ( i.e . via medical experiments ) . One particularly well-publicised idea is that polio vaccines played a role in the transfer.In his book , The River , the journalist Edward Hooper suggested that HIV could be traced to the testing of an oral polio vaccine called Chat , given to about a million people in the Belgian Congo , Ruanda and Urundi in the late 1950s . To be reproduced , live polio vaccine needs to be cultivated in living tissue , and Hooper 's belief is that Chat was grown in kidney cells taken from local chimps infected with SIVcmz . This , he claims , would have resulted in the contamination of the vaccine with chimp SIV , and a large number of people subsequently becoming infected with HIV-1.However , in February 2000 the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia ( one of the original places that developed the Chat vaccine ) announced that it had discovered in its stores a phial of polio vaccine that had been used as part of the program . The vaccine was subsequently analysed and in April 2001 it was announced4 that no trace had been found of either HIV or chimpanzee SIV . A second analysis5 confirmed that only macaque monkey kidney cells , which can not be infected with SIV or HIV , were used to make Chat . While this is just one phial of many , most have taken its existence to mean that the OPV vacc",0

"what is a brake lining ? Brake linings are composed of a relatively soft but tough and heat-resistant material with a high coefficient of dynamic friction ( and ideally an identical coefficient of static friction ) typically mounted to a solid metal backing using high-temperature adhesives or rivets . The complete assembly ( including lining and backing ) is then often called a brake pad or brake shoe . In this view of an automobile disc brake , the brake pad is the black material held by the red metal component ( the brake caliper ) . The brake lining is that part of the brake pad which actually contacts the metal rotor when the brake is engaged.Using a typical bicycle brake as an example , the backing would be the metal shell which provides mechanical support , and the lining would be the rubbery portion which contacts the rims when the brakes are applied . In most modern vehicular applications the system is conceptually identical , except the rims would be replaced with solid steel ( or sometimes exotic metal ) rotors . Furthermore , a metal tang is usually incorporated into the pad assembly . The tang contacts the rotors when the linings are worn out , causing an annoying noise designed to alert the motorist that brake servicing is required.Since the lining is the portion of the braking system which converts the vehicle 's kinetic energy into heat , the lining must be capable of surviving high temperatures without excessive wear ( leading to frequent replacement ) or outgassing ( which causes brake fade , a decrease in the stopping power of the brake ) . Due to its suitability , asbestos is often a component in brake linings ; as a result , brake dust should never be inhaled",0

"Are Space and Time continuous or are them quantized ? There are two major theories of modern physics : Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity . Both work well , with QM being applicable to atomic and smaller sizes , and GR to large ( Solar size , galaxy size , etc . ) things.The major question in physics today is : how do we combine QM and GR so that they are two aspects of one larger theory . This postulated theory is usually called a Unified Theory or Theory of Everything or something like that . String theories are attempts to do this ( so far all are still incomplete ) .The major difference between QM and GR is that nn QM energy comes in discrete levels ( all way to small for us to notice ) . However in GR space-time is continious . So it is not instantly clear whether space-time is continous or quantized in a unified theory.For consistency between these space quantization would have to be on extremely small scales . This would almost certain occur ( if it did ) at distances called the Planck length , which is ~ 10^-33 cm . ( This is about one billion trillion times smaller than an atomic nucleus . ) Quantization of time would then be the interval for light to cross this distance , about 10^-43 seconds . It is because of a lack of a unified theory that physicists ca n't say anything about the conditions of the universe before 10^-43 seconds after the Big Bang . ( Of course that is still pretty good . ) The short answer is : no one knows , but the scale of quantization would have to be much , much smaller than any known elementary particle .",0

"What is lake-effect snow ? Lake effect snow is also know as a snowsquall . It is produced in the winter when cold winds move across long expanses of warmer lake water , picking up water vapor which freezes and is deposited on the lee shores . This effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic effect of higher elevations on the downwind shores . This uplifting can produce narrow , but very intense bands of precipitation , which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow per hour . The areas affected by lake effect snow are called snowbelts.Cold winds in the winter typically prevail from the west-southwest to the northwest in the North Temperate Zone , producing the most dramatic lake effect snow falls on the northeast to south east shores of the Great Lakes . This lake effect produces a significant difference between the snow fall on the eastern and western shores of the Great Lakes . If the air temperature is not low enough to keep the precipitation frozen , it falls as lake effect rain.To can read a detailed article on Lake Snow Effect , Variables Contributing to Lake Effect Snow and Areas Hit By Lake Effect Snow and much more at the following articles : ( 1 ) http : //www.noaa.gov/questions/question_011602.html ( 2 ) http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_effect_snow ( 3 ) http : //www.usatoday.com/weather/tg/wlakeeff/wlakeeff.htm ( 4 ) http : //www.comet.ucar.edu/class/smfaculty/byrd/ ( 5 ) http : //www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap10/lake_effect_snow.html",0

"what causes hiccups ? Hiccups are gulping sounds caused by involuntary spasms of the diaphragm . The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen and helps with breathing . Hiccups can be triggered if you eat too much or too fast , consume very hot or cold foods and beverages , or drink carbonated beverages . Other causes include cold showers , entering or leaving a hot or cold room , sudden excitement , and stress . Hiccups are not a serious medical condition and usually disappear on their own within a few minutes . If they last longer than 24 hours , hiccups may be a sign of another condition or injury . You should see your health care provider if you experience prolonged hiccuping . Home remedies are usually the primary treatment for hiccups , although no one is really sure how well they work . Hiccup home remedies include sneezing , being suddenly frightened , holding your breath , gargling , drinking pineapple juice , drinking water rapidly , sipping ice water , or swallowing dry granulated sugar . These activities may help by altering breathing patterns .",0

Granted there has been many incidents with hispanics they are just trying to feed there family like many of us . You 're assuming that we are actually helping Iraq .

More often than not , the other countries end up worse off than before.Allowing unlimited Mexicans to enter the U.S. is not going to help Mexico or Mexicans . It will simply depress the already depressed economy in the border areas , and in metropolitan areas farther north.Nor will having the U.S. just throw money at Mexico help for more than a very short time . It may feed people for a short time , but it wo n't improve the economy . Mexico is poor because it is poor in natural resources , especially in arable land . The only way to improve the economy is to either improve the natural resources available or find ways of providing valuable goods services to entities outside of Mexico so that money is flowing into the country .",0

"How far will the Cincinnati Bengals go this football season ? This really all depends on how well the Cincinnati Bengals handle the pressure of the playoffs and how well the defense plays . Cincinnati Bengals rank 11th in total rushing yards , 6th in total passing yards and 4th in total Offense yards . Making them among the best offensive teams in the NFL today and the team is still young and learning how to work with each other.On the other hand the defense has been a nightmare . Only good thing going for the defense is the fumbles recovered and interceptions they have made this year , which plays a big role in why they are where they are now . The defense has allowed a total 1522 rushing yards , allowed 2735 passing yards and are ranked 24th in the NFL overall in yards allowed.In order to get to the SuperBowl the defense must step up and make the big plays , there is no room for error in the playoffs . I think they can get the 2nd seed in the AFC , with games left with only one team that has a winning record and good team . The other two games are against the coachless Lions and the Bills who are both no where near the playoffs . I like the Cincinnati Bengals chances of going to the SuperBowl and winning it , just do n't bet on it , unless the defense comes to play .",0

"What the mean of Valentines Day to a mankind ... ? is worth it ... ? Valentine 's Day falls on February 14 , and is the traditional day on which lovers in certain cultures let each other know about their love , commonly by sending Valentine 's cards , which are often anonymous . The history of Valentine 's day can be traced back to an obscure Catholic Church feast day , said to be in honor of Saint Valentine , are discussed below . The day 's associations with romantic love arrived after the High Middle Ages , during which the concept of romantic love was formulated.The day is now most closely associated with the mutual exchange of love notes in the form of `` valentines . '' Modern Valentine symbols include the heart-shaped outline and the figure of the winged Cupid . Starting in the 19th century , the practice of hand writing notes has largely given way to the exchange of mass-produced greeting cards . The Greeting Card Association estimates that , world-wide , approximately one billion valentine cards are sent each year , making the day the second largest card-sending holiday of the year behind Christmas . The association also estimates that women purchase approximately 85 percent of all valentines",0

"Instant Fire - Just Add Water ? I thought of this out of the blue and I was wondering if it would actually work ( in priciple ... I realize that there are a lot of engineering hurdles to overcome ) .Take powdered potasium and powdered magnesium . Add a little water . The water and potasium will react , producing heat and hydrogen . The heat will ignite the hydrogen which , in turn will will ignite the magnesium ... instant fireWill this actually work ? MistWing SilverTail adding water to potassium already causes it to explode . you are correct - the reaction releases hydrogen and forms an oxide of potassium , and the considerably exothermic nature of the reaction generates enough heat to ignite the hydrogen gas . so , mixing water and potassium solid typically causes a big-time explosion - just like mixing water and sodium.as for the powdered magnesium in there - i suspect that the explosion would scatter it , and it might ignite - the ignition temperature for magnesium metal is 450 C - so you 'd probably end up with white-hot burning magnesium shrapnel flying everywhere ! so , if you 're ever thinking about making a nasty bomb , sounds like a good way to do it .",0

"I have a Buddhist question : are there any Buddhist solar adorations ? What are they ? I am certainly aware that there are `` solar '' aspects to all of the great spiritual teachings . For example , the Bible speaks of `` the Sun of Righteousness '' in Malachi & of a Davidic solar vision in Psalms 19 . The Hindu Gayatri mantra is solar ( a SPIRITUAL , internal Sun , not the one in the sky - this also has to do w/the passage of the seasons , marking time ) . The ancient Egyptians were certainly into our shining orb , not sure about Islam yet.My question is , what is the Buddhist contribution ? I know they believe that all spiritual entities are mere forms of `` Buddha consciousness '' , a primordial essence beyond time & space that is STILL not a `` God '' - that 's another form ! I ca n't find this on any of the Buddhist links I 've checked . Sorry for asking something so hard . The phrase Sun of Enlightenment is one ( see reference below ) . Look up references to the Sun-faced Buddha . This is another solar reference.Unlike many religions which attempted to swallow pagan worshippers , Buddhism accepted no outside dogma or symbols except as they enhanced the concept of the Path to Enlightenment . Many in the West have a very hard time understanding what this means .",0

"What is a post-masters graduate certificate ? I have found a school that offers a post-masters graduate certificate . They say it is almost as good as a PHD . Any suggestions The post-masters graduate certificate is a degree level that is intermediate between the masters degree and the doctorate . It became popular in education careers where promotions or job grades depended in part on educational level . They recognized this `` sixth year '' degree level as one year of study beyond the master 's degree . You also sometimes see it referred to as a `` specialist 's '' degree because some of the early post-masters degrees were Educational Specialist ( Ed.S . ) degrees . Other common names are Certificate of Advanced Study or Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study . The utility of the post-masters certificate depends on what field you are in and why you want the degree . Some fields of study have the specialist level as the entering level for certification or licensure ( school psychology , for example ) , in which case you would find it vital . Some fields ( counseling , for example ) might have the level of training required for licensure at the equivalent of the post-masters certificate level ( 60 semester hours ) in which case having the certificate would be an advantage if you want to get licensed . Some fields allow you to specialize after taking a post masters certificate ( i.e . Infant Mental Health Nursing ) in which case the certificate is very useful . On the other hand , some fields really require a doctorate ( most college teaching , for example ) in which case the post-masters certificate , while good to have , wo n't fulfil the occupational requirement.I think the post-masters certificate is nice if you are working toward continuing education as it can help you make a more systematic study in your area of interest , and it appears that you have met a more unified goal than just taking courses.Hope this helps .",0

"i need info on thighroid cancer . My sister has this cancer and is getting the runaround from the doctor ? Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer . Thyroid cancer is a cancerous tumor or growth located within the thyroid gland . Thyroid cancer is one of the few cancers that has increased in incidence rates over the past several years . Its incidence has increased by about 3 % per 100,000 people per year . The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 25,690 new cases of thyroid cancer in the U.S. in 2005 . Of these new cases , about 19,190 will occur in women and about 6,500 will occur in men . About 1,490 people ( 860 women and 630 men ) will die of thyroid cancer in 2005 . Many patients , especially in the early stages of thyroid cancer , do not experience symptoms . However , as the cancer develops , symptoms can include a lump or nodule in the front of the neck , hoarseness or difficulty speaking , swollen lymph nodes , difficulty swallowing or breathing , and pain in the throat or neck . There are several types of thyroid cancer : papillary , follicular , medullary , anaplastic , and variants . Papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas are referred to as well-differentiated thyroid cancer and account for 80–90 % of all thyroid cancers . Variants include tall cell , insular , columnar , and Hurthle cell . Their treatment and management are similar . If detected early , most papillary and follicular thyroid cancer can be treated successfully.Medullary thyroid carcinoma ( MTC ) accounts for 5-10 % of all thyroid cancers.Medullary cancer is easier to treat and control if found before it spreads to other parts of the body . There are two types of medullary thyroid cancer : sporadic and familial . Genetic testing ( of the RET proto-oncogene should be performed in all patients with MTC to determine whether there are genetic changes that predict the development of MTC . In individuals with these genetic changes , removal of the thyroid during childhood has a high probability of being curative.Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is the least common and accounts for only 1–2 % of all thyroid cancer . This type is difficult to control and treat because it is a very aggressive type of thyroid cancer.Treatments for thyroid cancer include surgery , radioactive iodine treatment , external beam radiation therapy , and chemotherapy . In most cases , patients undergo surgery to remove most of the thyroid gland , and are treated with thyroid hormone replacement therapy . For those with papillary and follicular thyroid cancer , the dose of thyroid hormone replacement is usually high enough to suppress thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) well below the range that is normal for someone not diagnosed with thyroid cancer , to help prevent the growth of cancer cells while providing essential thyroid hormone to the body . Factors associated with thyroid cancer include a family history of thyroid cancer , gender ( women have a higher incidence of thyroid cancer ) , age ( the majority of cases occur in people over 40 , although thyroid cancer affects all age groups from children through seniors ) , and prior exposure of the thyroid gland to radiation . While the prognosis for most thyroid cancer patients is very good , the rate of recurrence can be up to 30 % , and recurrences can occur even decades after the initial diagnosis . Therefore , it is important that patients get regular follow-up examinations to detect whether the cancer has re-emerged . Monitoring should continue throughout the patient ’ s lifetime . Periodic follow-up examinations can include a review of the medical history together with selected blood tests appropriate for the type of cancer and stage of treatment ( TSH , thyroglobulin , CEA , and calcitonin levels ) , physical examination , and imaging techniques ( ultrasound , radioiodine whole body scan , chest X-ray , CT , MRI , PET , and other tests ) .",0

"Why is Ram for Dell computers so expensive it is called Rambus ram . ddr ram is cheap in comparison to rambus ? excerpt : Samsung Electronics , the world 's largest maker of computer memory chips , pleaded guilty Wednesday to a charge it participated in a worldwide price-fixing conspiracy that damaged competition and raised PC prices.Prosecutors said Samsung , which is based in Seoul , South Korea , and other companies conspired in e-mails , telephone calls and in-person meetings to fix the price of chips used in personal computers and other electronic devices.The outcome of the investigation also is expected to help fuel a private antitrust case filed by Rambus Inc. , which licensed a memory technology that had been embraced by Intel Corp. , the world 's largest maker of the microprocessor brains of computers.In 1996 , Intel chose Rambus technology to help speed up systems running its then-upcoming Pentium 4.But the chip makers did not want to pay Rambus royalties . DRAM prices fell sharply - so much so that Intel agreed to support non-Rambus technology in the fall of 2001.Shortly after that , DRAM prices nearly quadrupled .",0

"What are the roots of the words in Esperanto ? The grammar itself is extremely easy , although it could have been easier . vocabulary from Romance and Germanic languages ; phonology from Slavic languages As a constructed language , Esperanto is not genealogically related to any ethnic language . Esperanto can be described as `` a language lexically predominantly romanic , morphologically intensively agglutinative and to a certain degree isolating in character '' The phonology , grammar , vocabulary , and semantics are based on the western Indo-European languages . The phonemic inventory is essentially Slavic , as is much of the semantics , while the vocabulary derives primarily from the Romance languages , with a lesser contribution from Germanic . Pragmatics and other aspects of the language not specified by Zamenhof 's original documents were influenced by the native languages of early speakers , primarily Russian , Polish , German , and French.Typologically , Esperanto has prepositions and a pragmatic word order that by default is Subject Verb Object and Adjective Noun . New words are formed through extensive prefixing and suffixing.Esperanto is written with a modified version of the Latin alphabet , including six letters with diacritics : ĉ , ĝ , ĥ , ĵ , ŝ and ŭ ( that is , c , g , h , j , s circumflex , and u breve ) . The alphabet does not include the letters q , w , x , y except in unassimilated foreign names .",0

"Does anyone know anything about Linus Pauling any written work ? ? ? Pauling , Linus Carl ( 1901-1994 ) , American chemist and physicist , whose investigations into the structure of molecules led to discoveries of how chemicals bond.Pauling was born in Portland , Oregon , on February 28 , 1901 , and educated at Oregon State College and the California Institute of Technology . He began to apply his insights into quantum physics as Professor of Chemistry at the institute , where from 1927 to 1964 he made many of his discoveries . By devising techniques such as X-ray and electron diffraction , he was able to calculate interatomic distances and the angles between chemical bonds.During the 1930s Pauling introduced concepts that helped reveal the bonding forces of molecules . The Nature of the Chemical Bond , the result of these investigations , has been a major influence on scientific thinking since it was published in 1939 . Pauling also investigated the atomic structure of proteins , including haemoglobin , and discovered that cell deformity in sickle-cell anaemia is caused by a genetic defect that influences the production of haemoglobin . He was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work . In later years Pauling fought ardently against nuclear weapons testing , warning the public of the biological dangers of radioactive fallout , and presented a petition to the United Nations in 1958 signed by over 11,000 other scientists . In 1962 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , becoming the second person , after Marie Curie , to win two Nobel Prizes.Throughout his scientific career , Pauling followed his creative hunches , no matter how controversial they were . In 1970 , for example , he advocated large doses of vitamin C to treat the common cold—a belief , however , that few medical authorities have endorsed .",0

"Are you a Calvinist or an Armenian ? Explain why and back up your position with Bible verse please ? Please only serious answers . Calvinist . [ Arminians ] ... say that the Augustinian tradition subordinates the love of God to the will of God ... But this is not what distinguishes the Augustinian tradition from the Arminian tradition . The distinction is between intensive and extensive love , between an intensive love that saves its loved ones , and an extensive love that loves everyone in general and saves no one in particular . Or if you really wish to cast this in terms of willpower , it 's the distinction between divine willpower and human willpower . Or , to put the two together , does God will the salvation of everyone with a weak-willed , ineffectual love , or does God love his loved ones with a resolute will that gets the job done ? The God of Calvin is the good shepherd , who names and numbers his sheep , who saves the lost sheep and fends off the wolf . The God of Wesley is the hireling , who knows not the flock by name and number , who lets the sheep go astray and be eaten by the wolf . Which is more loving , I ask ? - Steve HaysJohn 10:7-9 ( NKJV ) Then Jesus said to them again , `` Most assuredly , I say to you , I am the door of the sheep . [ 8 ] All who ever came before Me are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not hear them . [ 9 ] I am the door . If anyone enters by Me , he will be saved , and will go in and out and find pasture . John 6:44 ( NKJV ) No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him ; and I will raise him up at the last day . John 6:45 ( NKJV ) It is written in the prophets , 'And they shall all be taught by God . ' Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me . John 15:16 ( NKJV ) You did not choose Me , but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit , and that your fruit should remain , that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you . Ephes . 1:4-5 ( NKJV ) just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love , [ 5 ] having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself , according to the good pleasure of His will , Romans 8:29-30 ( NKJV ) For whom He foreknew , He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son , that He might be the firstborn among many brethren .

"give 1safety precaution should be taken when celestine is heated with carbon in a lab and reason ? Celestine is sometimes used to produce a red color in fireworks . Charcoal ( carbon ) is also used in pyrotechnics . Charcoal from soft woods , such as grape vine or willow , is good for fast-burning compositions like black powder , whereas charcoal from hard woods like pine are used to create long-lasting spark effects . In any laboratory setting proper personal protection equipment should be employed . I recommend using safety glasses , a laboratory coat , full length pants and latex/polyethylene gloves . You should n't wear open toed shoes and loose articles of clothing that could snag . In cases were an explosion is possible , proper shielding is required . A fume hood is also required if hazardous fumes are expected.Also , if you are resorting to using an online forum to recieve answers to potentially dangerous reactions , you obviously do not know what you are doing and should gently place down your little pyrotechnics and slowly back away .",0

"what does center do really ? i 'm new to this sport but i like it very much.can anybody teach me a little Typically , the center is the tallest man on the floor . Traditional centers stay close to the basket on offense , where they can use their size to get good shots because they are so close . Often these are dunks , layups , put backs ( shots off of a rebound ) , or hook shots . They 're also expected to be the best rebounders , since they are taller than everyone else.On defense , centers again stay close to the basket because if a guard or forward gets around the person defending them , the center can still slide over and block or alter the shot ( since presumably , he is taller than the player trying to shoot ) . They are again expected to rebound.Non-traditional centers , particularly those from foreign countries ( no idea why ) , move farther from the basket to shoot . Some , like China 's Wang Zhu-Zhu , are actually good three point shooters . Having a center like this is sometimes considered an advantage , since traditional centers are not used to guarding a player far from the basket .",0

"Has anyone lived in India ? What was your experience ? I want to visit but India is so vast and has so many appealing areas , that I would n't know where to begin ? Any advice ? it depends on what you want to do and see . I would n't say that I lived there , but I was there for 5 months . The longest period of time i was in one place was 2 months . Honestly i do n't even know where to begin describing what it was like . it was without a doubt a very positive , but sometimes stressful , experience . I think that everybody should travel to india at least once . I traveled only in the north , so that is the only area i can really give advice on . For the south i heard that Kerala , Hampi , and Pondicherry were the places to see , but I could n't tell you if that is true . To start with let me say that traveling in india is not as daunting as it seems . i started out with a program , but stayed on after its end when i realized that i would be able to get around on my own . unless you have about a year , you will probably not see everything , so do n't worry about seeing everything . You can probably get by just fine with only english , but it never hurts to know a little hindi or whatever the local language is , if only to see the shock on people 's faces . lol . The cost is very cheap , you can easily get by on $ 10 a day ( room , board , insurance , food , and maybe transportation ) .

"what is an interrupt ? There is a good summary of what an interrupt is at the sources listed below . Cutting and pasting the content from one link : A signal informing a program that an event has occurred . When a program receives an interrupt signal , it takes a specified action ( which can be to ignore the signal ) . Interrupt signals can cause a program to suspend itself temporarily to service the interrupt . Interrupt signals can come from a variety of sources . For example , every keystroke generates an interrupt signal . Interrupts can also be generated by other devices , such as a printer , to indicate that some event has occurred . These are called hardware interrupts . Interrupt signals initiated by programs are called software interrupts . A software interrupt is also called a trap or an exception . PCs support 256 types of software interrupts and 15 hardware interrupts . Each type of software interrupt is associated with an interrupt handler -- a routine that takes control when the interrupt occurs . For example , when you press a key on your keyboard , this triggers a specific interrupt handler . The complete list of interrupts and associated interrupt handlers is stored in a table called the interrupt vector table , which resides in the first 1 K of addressable memory .",0

"Is it common for the surgical pen ( attatched to a broken leg ) to poke thru the skin ? My cat recently broke her back right femur in 5 seperate splinters and had to have a surgical pen adhered to the bone with wires . How common is it for it to shift up and actually pierce thru the skin ? Does this happen often in the mediacl industry , in humans or animals ? What could have caused it ? It can . Some procedures ( with humans ) require either external braces that are acually attatched to the bone via pins and screws . Some are temporary screws that are left sticking out of the bone that eventually may protrude through the skin . The doctors do n't make them flush with the surface of the bone because that makes it easier to remove them . However , the inside of bones is sterile .

"Why do people every six minutes have to ask which came first the chicken or the egg ? The answer is always the egg . Thats the correct answer anyway . 1 ) Because they can ? : ^ ) 2 ) Because they like to stir up debates between creationists and evolutionists.3 ) Because they think it is an unanswerable riddle when it isn't.It is an interesting question but people really do n't think it through enough to show just how interesting it is . How you answer the question reflects on your belief system , your powers of deductive reasoning , and/or your sense of humor.If you subscribe to evolution ( as I do ) , then it 's very simple -- eggs existed long before chickens ever did . Fish lay eggs . Amphibians lay eggs . Reptiles lay eggs . Dinosaurs layed eggs . Prototypical birds layed eggs . Early mammals layed eggs . ( Even current mammals called monotremes lay eggs ) . So obviously eggs came before chickens by this line of reasoning.Following evolutionary theory , genetics , and the development of embryos , one might argue that again , the egg came before the chicken because the first chicken is a genetic mutation of two chicken like parents . So , from this line of reasoning , you might , again argue the egg if you are talking about first chicken relative to the egg . For the first chicken had to develop inside the egg as the offspring of two chicken-like parents.But then I realized `` Hey , how did the first zygotic chicken ( fertilized ovum ) get inside the egg in the first place ? '' If the ovum was inside an egg shell with yoke and rooster sperm is added afterward , then the egg comes first . But what if the the ovum is fertilized first , then encased in an egg shell ? Then would not the zygotic chicken come before the egg ? A quick look on Wikipedia for bird reproduction indicates that the eggs are fertilized with sperm during the descent from the ovaries through the cloaca . If this is the case , then , again , the egg comes before the chicken.So , I forgot to add one reason people ask this question every six minutes:4 ) Because they have too much time on their hands . : ^ )",0

To wit ... - Be skeptical of anything you receive in e-mail that was not solicited , especially if it has an attachment.- Think twice before downloading that freeware.- Avoid Kazaa and the like.- Do review website certificates to satisfy yourself that the site you 're heading for is really the site you wanted to go to.- Make sure you download and install every security patch your OS vendor provides .

"what do you know about SOURASHTRA ? Sourashtra ( alternate names and spellings : Palkar , Sowrashtra , Saurashtra , Saurashtri , Patnuli ) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in parts of the Southern Indian State of Tamil Nadu . The Ethnologue puts the number of speakers at 310,000 ( 1997 IMA ) , although the actual number could be double this figure or even more.ClassificationSourashtra is a Indo-Aryan language belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family.Geographical DistributionThe speakers of the Sourashtra language , known as Sourashtrians , maintain a predominant presence in Madurai , a city in the southern part of Tamil Nadu . Though official figures are hard to come by , it is believed that the Sourashtra population makes up for about one-third of the city 's total population . They are present in significant numbers in the cities of Dindigul , Paramakudi , Erode , Palani , Rajapalayam , Nilakottai , Salem , Thanjavur , Trichy , Kumbakonam , Thiruvarur and Kottar ( Nagercoil ) . A sizable number is also found in Chennai , Bangalore and other parts of India , but this presence is largely due to small-scale migrations in the last few decades from one of the aforesaid traditional Sourashtrian settlements.It is also believed that Sourashtra speakers exist , albeit in small numbers , in other southern states such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka . However , in the absence of any reliable facts to substantiate this claim , this remains a speculation at best.HistoryThough there is little historical evidence available to support the argument that the Sourashtrians lived in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat in Western India , folklore , and recent linguistic and genetic researches have been able to establish that this region was indeed once the habitat of the Sourashtrians . However , their language has more similarities with Marathi and Konkani , both Indo-Aryan languages of Western India , than it does with Modern Gujarati , the language of present-day Gujarat . Linguists have been able to explain why it is so : Both Sourashtra and Gujarati branched off from a common parent , and have since taken completely different paths to modernity . Gujarati came under the influence of Persian , Arabic , many tribal languages and Hindi , whereas Sourashtra , taking off from Gujarat before it had made any Muslim contact , was influenced by Marathi , Konkani , Kannada , Telugu , and finally , Tamil . It has been acknowledged that Persian and Arabic have had only limited influence on Marathi and Konkani , and this is why they still retain a good amount of vocabulary and grammar derived from Sanskrit , as compared to other daughter languages of Sanskrit . It is possible that the vocabulary and grammar shared between Modern Sourashtra and Marathi is what was originally derived from Sanskrit.The southward flight of the Sourashtrians seems to have been triggered by the frequent Muslim invasions of their homeland and the instability caused by it . No details are available as to whether it was a mass-migration and when it took place . They found the safe haven they were looking for in the Vijayanagar Kingdom , with its capital at Hampi in present-day Karnataka , which was then expanding southwards . They , whose traditional occupation was weaving , were able to impress upon the Emperor with their weaving skills , and soon were elevated to the position of Royal Weavers . Telugu and Kannada were the court languages , though other languages such as Sanskrit and Tamil were also in use . It was during this period that Sourashtra started absorbing Telugu and Kannada words into its lexicon.Vijayanagar rulers had the practice of appointing Governors , known as Nayaks , to manage far-flung regions of the empire . When Madurai and Thanjavur were annexed to the empire , Governors were appointed to administer the new territories . It is believed that a part of the Sourashtra community moved to Madurai and Thanjavur to serve the Governors . ****Hey why di they suspend you from yahoo*****",0

"printable lesson revelation 12 : ? REVELATION 12:1-1712:1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven ; a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and upon her head a crown of twelve stars : 12:2 And she being with child cried , travailing in birth , and pained to be delivered . 12:3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven ; and behold a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crowns upon his heads . 12:4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child as soon as it was born . 12:5 And she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron : and her child was caught up unto God , and to his throne . 12:6 And the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared of God , that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days . 12:7 And there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels fought against the dragon ; and the dragon fought and his angels , 12:8 And prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more in heaven . 12:9 And the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the Devil , and Satan , which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him . 12:10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , Now is come salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power of his Christ : for the accuser of our brethren is cast down , which accused them before our God day and night . 12:11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb , and by the word of their testimony ; and they loved not their lives unto the death . 12:12 Therefore rejoice , ye heavens , and ye that dwell in them . Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea ! for the devil is come down unto you , having great wrath , because he knoweth that he hath but a short time . 12:13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth , he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child . 12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle , that she might fly into the wilderness , into her place , where she is nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent . 12:15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood . 12:16 And the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth . 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman , and went to make war with the remnant of her seed , which keep the commandments of God , and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .",0

"what are the solutions for female hair lossing ? The most common type of hair loss seen in women is androgenetic alopecia , also known as female pattern alopecia . Alopecia means baldness , but just as in men , it does not have to be complete hair loss . This is seen as hair thinning predominantly over the top and front of the head . It affects approximately one-third of all susceptible women , but is most commonly seen after menopause Female pattern hair loss may begin as early as puberty . In these cases if there are signs of hormone imbalance , such as excess facial or body hair , a hormone evaluation should be done . Hormonal changes are a common cause of female hair loss . Many women do not realize that hair loss can occur after pregnancy or following discontinuation of birth control pills . It may also follow any sudden physical or psychological stress to the body . These types of hair loss are `` Telogen Effluvium '' and are usually temporary . It is important to remember that this hair loss may be delayed by up to three months following the change . Up to 8 months will be required for regrowth to be fully achieved.Treatment often starts with Rogaine ( topical minoxidil 2 % ) . Rogaine is the only FDA approved medication currently available for female pattern hair loss . The other hair loss medication , Propecia , just does n't work in women at all . Aldactone ( spironolactone ) pills help many women , especially whose hair loss starts before menopause but takes many months . Hormone replacement pills , such as Prempro , plus Aldactone are better after menopause . Experienced hair transplant surgeons can often achieve excellent results in women with the new follicular unit and minigraft techniques . You have to be a qualified candidate and have realistic expectations .",0

"do u people think ice age will come back agein ? I have an MS in paleoclimatology , and I have to say that it is one of the most fascinating topics Ive ever delved into . It 's also amusing to see non-scientist 's responses here and on other message boards ! If you wanted to ask a scientist , you would have to define what you mean when you say `` ice age . '' There are varying degrees of `` ice ages . '' For brevity sake , I will assume you mean the relatively cold periods that last approximately 100,000 years that have dominated global climate for the last 2 million years . Contrary to popular belief , there are periods during the `` ice ages '' that are almost as warm as today.Based on paleoclimate evidence that suggest the ice ages have come and gone at least six times in the last 2 million years , the probability is that it will occur again.The difficult and possibly dramatic question is : when ? Seeing as though the last `` ice age '' generally ended about 12,000 years ago ( this is debatable , since there is no one date where everywhere across the globe it suddenly became warm ) , and the average interglacial is 10,000 years , we are overdue.Consider the widely accepted hypothesis that `` global warming '' -- whether it be natural , human-induced , or a combination -- can ultimately ( Ill spare you the details ) lead to an ice age . Melting polar sea ice , indicator species dying off in the tropics , large disintigrations of ice shelves in the Antarctic , estimations that global sea level may rise 4 inches in the next 100 years , `` wild '' weather in many parts of the US ... are these all tell-tale signs that we have already begun down the road to the next glacial period ? ! ? ! ? New-ish data suggest that past climates have changed rapidly -- like someone else mentioned either in this thread or another similar one -- several degrees Celsius in a matter of decades or less ! The great ice sheets that once reached as far south as Long Island and Iowa wont reappear for tens of thousands of years , but it could get chilly across much of the country real quick ! And possibly as soon as 2020 !",0

"Have i screwed myself over ? If i slacked off for the first two years of highschool and failed a lot of classes , but now in my third year am making A 's and B 's have i screwed myself out of going to a good college like a University ? Not necessarily . Many colleges look at both your overall gpa and your last two years gpa . So , hopefully you will do very well this year and next year . Remember that you only have two more semesters to get grades before most applications are due ( you have this spring 's grades and next fall 's grades ) so it is critical that you do well . Remember , that gpa is one very important factor in admissions , but most colleges also want you to have high SAT or ACT scores , so you need to prepare for doing well on this test . You can study for it , and I like to have people study for it by buying a bunch of practice tests and taking a practice test a week for 8-12 weeks . Take a test , score it , and then look up every item you got wrong . Then repeat . You should see your scores improving.Finally , colleges really do want to see that you have some significant interests within and outside of school . So , you also need to show that you have leadership potential , or talent , or community impact . Clubs , hobbies , and community service can all be a part . Finally , you really need to be able to do a good personal statement . It probably would be helpful to address your poor grades , why you had them and what you learned about yourself so that you could turn it around . Be able to address your values and why you and the school you are applying to are a good match . Hang in there , do well , and remember that college applications are multifaceted .",0

"Where can I find an inexpensive but accurate hygrometer ? I want to be able to calibrate it and I need to spend under $ 50 . Nice question , most people unless they are weather buffs or cigar afficianados do n't know about hygrometers.Hygrometers measure relative humidity , or how damp or dry the air is.There are digital and analog hygrometers.Calibration ( adjusting for accuracy ) of both is difficult for various reasons . To calibrate a hygrometer means you need an accurate reference which provides accurate relative humidities over a range of air temperatures and pressures . It is not enough to calibrate a hygrometer at just one point . Most analog ( dial ) hygrometers only allow you to set one point by twiddling the fixed dial until the needle is pointing to the current moisture level.Most inexpensive digital hygrometers do not have calibration controls . The next price level up only allow you to set offset and scale - this is so-called `` linear calibration '' and it is not much better really.Depending on what you are measuring , one of the easiest ways to make your own accurate hygrometer is with two accurate but inexpensive lab thermometers . See the link on how to make a wet bulb hygrometer.Cheap hygrometers are easy to find on auction sites like ebay or yahoo , and using Googles Froogle search .",0

"Where do Muslims and Buddists stand on abortion ? bismillahir rahmanir raheem . I will answer this to the best of my ability and knowledge and Allah knows best . First of all , pre Islamic Arabs did not kill ALL of the girl infants otherwise there would have been no more Arabs . But female infanticide did exist and was generally an economic concern more than anything , and had nothing to do with `` bad omens '' , it says in the Quran `` Kill not your children for fear of want '' . Prophet Muhammad ( SAW ) put an end to that practice of female infanticide . But to answer your question , there is no concensus today amongst learned people , male and female but the predominant opinion is that Abortion is not allowed unless a physician says it is necessary to save the life of the mother . This is because our lives and bodies are not our own . They are gifts to us from our creator and only our creator has the right to take them away . But while we have them they are in our care and we are responsible for that . For instance , smoking has been shown to be harmful and the concensus opinion is that it is not allowed because of that . Taking a human life is the ultimate action in this way and it includes the taking of the human life that is growing in the mother 's womb . Children also are considered to be a gift from Allah ( SWT ) and we are not allowed to kill them before or after they leave the mother 's womb . A second , minority opinion , says that since the soul does not enter the body until 40 days after conception therefore abortion is legal for the first 40 days . This opinion is an extreme minority.Salim",0

"How did language start ? Especially the English language.. who define the ABCDE ... . Language predates the alphabet . The origins of Language are lost to the mists of time . The alphabet as we know it was developed by the Phonecians about 3000 years ago , and modified first by the Greeks , and then the Romans for their own languages before we adopted it from the Romans.The origins of the English language specifically date to sometime after 1066 when Willam the Conqueror became King of England . The commoners spoke something related to the ancestor language of Dutch while the nobility spoke French . We kept the grammar of the native Anglo-Saxon tongue while adding huge amounts of French vocabulary.The result is recognizably English , while still sounding very different from what we speak today . It 's not until Shakespear 's time that Modern English emerged .",0

"what impcat of personal computers does it have on correspondence ? Personal computers introduced a more efficient form of asynchronous communication . Synchronous communication is when both parties are talking , communicating at the same time . This is like a chat room , or a telephone conversation . The difficulty that this can cause arises with the different time zones , schedule conflicts , etc.Asychronous communication is when both parties need not be present , thereby eliminating the difficulty of time zones and other scheduling difficulties . Prior to personal computers being used for correspondence , mail was used . Because of the delays between writing a message , a letter , and the recipient getting the letter , this was not very efficient . The telegraph sped up the process a bit , but could be expensive , and did not allow for long and detailed messages . Fax machines helped speed up the process , but , for a long time , you needed specialized and expensive equipment . E-mail introduced a very fast , and inexpensive , means of asynchronous communication , and because personal computers are becoming more and more common , more people are able to use the process .",0

"How to handle school treating your kid badly ? My son is always being corrected for things from other teachers for things even if otherkids are involed they don ` t get corrected for it only my son does.This is not fair to him and is making him not want to go to school .

If it comes down to the word of your child vs. the school 's , it is a good bet that the school is correct . There are counseling opportunities that your son could use in his school to help him with the issues that he is dealing with , which may be manifesting in the form of poor behavior .",0

"Learning english and need help with phrases ! ! ? Please help me with any of these questions！They are talking about horse racing.①man says : “ So I was wondering if maybe you needed some horses looking after．Pretty anxious to train again ” this man has a brokendown horse and he talks to , once was , his owner ( you ) . Does he means he is selling his horse and himself ? ②I 'm asking a job , I 'd even be willing to ... Cut my fee ? Does he mean it would be ok to have low payment if he get a job ? ③Yeah , I think I 'm gon na have to go with the second rule of horse racing . Never beat a dead horse.What is the second rule mean ? 1 . He appears to be asking the man if he needs someone to look after his horses . He is suggesting that he would like to do take this job as he is keen to get back into training horses which is what he has done before.2 . Yes . He is saying that he would be willing to accept less money than normal to do the job.3 . Beat a dead horse ( actually the real expression is - Flog a dead horse ) is an expression which means to do something which has no point because it is already settled . For example , if a child asked his mother for something and she said NO and would not change her mind , then to keep asking can be described as - Beating ( Flogging ) a dead horse . In your example it possibly is referring to the pointlessness of asking for work when none is on offer . But it is also meant to be funny in this case because the subject is actually about horses : - ) The expression probably comes from the pointlessness of beating a horse ( to make it work harder ) if it is dead ! !",0

Soluble fiber is very good at lowering cholesterol as it binds the bile ( a digestive agent ) & causes you to excrete it . The body makes more bile ( to replace that which was lost - if it was n't lost , the body tends to recycle bile ) from cholesterol . You 'll find soluble fiber in foods such as apples , oranges & oatmeal . Insoluble fiber is also good for your heart , so eat high fiber foods like beans & veggies . Sodium does not affect your cholesterol level , but it can affect heart health so it 's best to keep it to a minimum . A little exercize , such as walking for 30 minutes 3 times a week , will also work wonders . If you eat a Whte bread , try to switch to something like Nature 's Own White Wheat , which has lots of fibre . Try & drink fat-free or 1 % milk instead of whole milk .

So American English is n't really the standard for everyone ( although it is for many if they have economic or cultural ties to the United States ) .As for how the standard evolved , there have always been standards . In general , the dialect of whoever 's in power is considered the standard , because people want to be like that powerful group . Americans who are trying to speak Standard American English do so because they think it will give them social power . What 's interesting , though , is that Standard American English is just agreed upon as the standard by many Americans even though it does n't belong to a particular region.The Founding Fathers spoke a dialect that is different from either American dialects or British dialects today . They were British , but in the meantime English has evolved in both places .",0

Do you use the standard normal prob . chart for this , how do you figure it , Im so confused .

In other words : P ( Z > 1 ) = 1 - P ( Z < 1 ) P ( Z > 1 ) = 1 - 0.841345 = .158655Almost 16 % of infants have birthweights above 125 oz .",0

"which is a good album to start on the beatles ? i 've loved all of the beatles songs i 've heard so far and want to buy an album , but there 's so many and they 're all good ! which do i start with ?

It serves as a good survey.If you think you will eventually get all their albums maybe you do n't want a greatest hits album like `` One . '' In that case I 'd think about what period Beatles you like the best and pick one of the following : `` Meet The Beatles '' ( very early ) ; `` Rubber Soul '' ( middle peroid , where things start to get more complicated ; `` Abbey Road '' ( late Beatles -- mix of stuff . ) In some ways Sgt . Pepper is considered their best , but much of that is beacuse of its historical significance , its psychedelia , and its sort-of theme album status -- all of which I think are less important today than at the time .

"how do i score a 750+ + score for the GMAT ? Which courses , books etc should I use ? The GMAT is essentially a glorified SAT - all the stuff in there you definitely learned pre-college . I 've never been a big proponent of the GMAT classes because I feel you can get everything out of the book . The class is n't going to teach you some random formula you do n't already know . Both the books and classes essentially spell out what format of questions will be asked in each section . Then they drill you on that format repeatedly until solving for that type of equation or that grammatical structure is second nature no matter what weird way they ask it on the test . I would recommend getting one of the books , Kaplan is pretty much the industry standard . Read it all the way through . Then take every practice test in the book , then save a few bucks and go hang out in the bookstore and take a half a dozen practice tests in other GMAT prep books .

"does muscle really weigh more than fat ? my daughter and i have a debate on this ? yes muscles weigh more than fat here is why ... .Muscle weighs more than fat because muscle cells that compose muscle are denser than fat cells . Why is this ? Because fat cell cytoplasm contains mostly oils ( lipids ) , whereas muscle cell cytoplasm contains mostly contractile proteins ( myosin and actin ) suspended in an aqueous ( watery ) environment . Lipids in general are less dense than water . You can prove this by mixing salad oil with water in a bottle and shaking it . Eventually , the oil will separate from the water and float to the top to form a lighter layer floating on top of the water . This lowered density of lipids make fatty tissue less heavy than muscle .",0

"IS the freezing of water exothermic ? The guy above me does n't know what he 's talking about . He 's confused . Think about it : to freeze water , you need to take energy away from the water , right ? ( You lower the temperature , which is the same thing as taking energy away . Imagine sucking energy away from water to make it freeze . ) So , by definition , freezing water is exothermic . It gives off energy . Conversely , the melting of water is endothermic ; you need to give ice energy in order for it to melt . I know it can get confusing because when you touch ice , it 's cold , so you might think that freezing is endothermic , but it 's not . If you think about it , ice in your hand is taking away energy from your hand in order for it to melt ( that 's why it feels cold ) , so melting is endothermic , making freezing exothermic .",0

"HOw do El Ninos warm water 's affect the weather. ? needs to be at least 80 words long okay , now that enough time has gone by to keep you from just copying this onto your homework : ( at least that 's what I read in when you say ..needs to be 80 words.. ) I quote : '' Because El Niño 's warm pool feeds thunderstorms above , it creates increased rainfall across the east-central and eastern Pacific Ocean.In South America , the effects of El Niño are direct and stronger than in North America . An El Niño is associated with warm and very wet summers ( December-February ) along the coasts of northern Peru and Ecuador , causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme . The effects during the months of February , March and April may become critical . Southern Brazil and northern Argentina also experience wetter than normal conditions but mainly during the spring and early summer . Central Chile receives a mild winter with large rainfall , and the Peruvian-Bolivian Altiplano is sometimes exposed to unusual winter snowfall events . Drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the Amazon River Basin , Colombia and Central America.Direct effects of El Niño resulting in drier conditions occur in Indonesia , increasing forest fires , in the Philippines , and northern Australia . Drier than normal conditions are also generally observed in Queensland , inland Victoria , inland New South Wales and eastern Tasmania during June-August.West of the Antarctic Peninsula , the Ross , Bellingshausen , and Amundsen Sea sectors have more sea ice during El Niño . The latter two and the Weddell Sea also become warmer and have higher atmospheric pressure.In North America , typically , winters are warmer than normal in the upper Midwest states and Canada , while central and southern California , northwest Mexico and the southeastern U.S. , are wetter than normal . Summer is wetter in the intermountain regions of the U.S . The Pacific Northwest states , on the other hand , tend to be drier during an El Niño . During a La Niña , by contrast , the Midwestern U.S. tends to be drier than normal . El Niño is also associated with decreased hurricane activity in the Atlantic.Finally , East Africa , including Kenya , Tanzania and the White Nile basin , experiences in the long rains from March to May wetter than normal conditions . There also are drier than normal conditions from December to February in south-central Africa , mainly in Zambia , Zimbabwe , Mozambique and Botswana '' source : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_nino",0

"What should I eat or not eat to help prevent a herpes outbreak ? Lysine is one of numerous amino acids that the body needs for growth and tissue repair . It is classified as one of the nine `` essential '' amino acids because you need to get it from outside sources such as foods or supplements -- in other words the body ca n't make it on its own . Researchers are exploring the value of lysine supplementation and the consumption of lysine-rich foods for lowering cholesterol , improving athletic performance , and enhancing recovery after surgery.Some nutritionally oriented physicians and dentists recommend taking lysine during an outbreak of canker sores to speed healing . The exact cause of these tiny but quite painful mouth ulcers is unclear , but most research indicates that a virus is responsible . However , there have been almost no clinical trials using lysine as a remedy for canker sores.The most promising application of lysine is its use in managing and preventing painful and unsightly herpes sores caused by the herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) .Specifically , lysine may help to : # Prevent and relieve cold sores ( herpes ) . Exciting research over the past several decades suggests that lysine may be helpful in controlling herpes simplex-related infections . There are two types of this virus : type 1 , which typically causes cold sores or fever blisters around the mouth , and type 2 , which tends to cause genital sores . However , both forms can cause eruptions around the mouth or on the genitals . Once infected with the virus , you have it permanently . It may lie dormant , but it does n't go away . Outbreaks are usually painful and unsightly , as well as contagious.A few years ago , researchers discovered that in order to grow ( replicate ) , the herpes virus needs arginine , another common amino acid . ( Foods high in arginine include chocolate , peanuts , almonds , seeds , cereal grains , gelatin , and raisins . ) Lysine competes with arginine for absorption and entry into tissue cells . And when lysine is present , it inhibits the growth of HSV by knocking out arginine.This makes a diet high in lysine and low in arginine a useful tool in managing HSV infections . In a recent study , participants consumed large amounts of lysine ( about 1 gram three times each day ) while restricting food sources of arginine . A significant number of participants ( 74 % ) noticed an improvement in their HSV infections and a decrease in the number of outbreaks.-As a side note , broccoli is also one of the better vegetable to help your body in keeping outbreaks at bay .",0

Our solar system- the Sun , planets , Kuiper belt and Oort cloud , everything orbiting the sun even many times further than the orbit of Pluto- is thought to have condensed from a vast cloud of interstellar gas some billions of years ago when that cloud was shocked or squeezed by a supernova explosion . The dust and grains that condensed out of the cooling solar gas aggregated to form larger fragments of rock . Chondritic meteorites are basically just such collections of grains and fragments that have been compacted together to form a larger piece of rock and eventually small planetary bodies . Such bodies are termed planetesimals when they become roughly as large as asteroids ( several kilometres to a few hundred kilometres in dimension ) . The larger they grow , the greater the gravitational attraction that the planetesimals exert and hence the more effectively they sweep up additional particles and rock fragments while circling the Sun . ( Britannica CD ) Because that initial shockwave came from a particular direction and because the cloud was not of uniform density , the particles had a net rotation around their center of gravity . Humans subsequently identified that direction as `` counterclockwise as viewed from above the north pole of the sun '' . As the bodies of the solar system grew by accretion , particles swept up from different distances from the center of gravity ( the sun ) had different orbital velocities . Analogously , water swirling down a drain moves slower further and faster closer to the center . Galileo and Newton showed that rotational energy is conserved : The sun and planets ‘ inherited ' their spin from the orbits of their constituent particles , so to speak . Today , some five billion years later , all that rotational energy is still conserved in the rotations and revolutions of the bodies of the solar system . Our solar system is not unchanging , though . Because of gravitational interactions between moons and their planets , between the planets , meteors and comets themselves and interactions between the solar wind and the magnetospheres of the planets , rotational energy is still be ‘ traded ' back and forth : Mercury orbits in a 3:2 resonance with its rotation , our day is getting longer while the moon only shows one face towards us , the rings of the gas giants are temporary phenomena , ... But that 's another story.In other words , An act of GOD",0

Gypsum - gauzes , look like white , rigid leafs and I think that you can buy them also from the drugstore.Now , let me describe you the procedure : 1 . You will put some vaseline in the face of the doll , just a small amount.We need this , because when you will finish your artistic work , it will be easier for you to separate the mask from the doll.2 . Then you will put the first gauze in the water just for a second ; now place this gauze in the face of the doll and continue doing the same thing with the other gauzes.You have to create at least 4 or 5 layers of these special gauzes . 3 .

"How can I start a prison ministry in my church and have it remain safe for children ? Your church should already have guidelines of who should be allowed to be near the children . My church has a background check done on all people that want to work with the children . We also have teams of two workers per each class . We try to have more women than men work with the children.After classes are done , it is the parents responsibility to keep an eye on their children . We return their children directly to the parent and do n't just let the children loose to roam the church grounds.With rules and guidelines in place , a prison ministry should be fine . Pedophiles are required to let the town they move to know about their background . You can check your local listings . They will have a picture of the person and the crime they have committed .

"Is Congenital heart disease sex linked ? Your question is heard to understand . Is it Sex linked ... as in whether it is male or female linked ? Nothing I have read would say that is is found nmore in one sex than another.Congenital means inborn or existing at birth . This is what I found on the site noted in the sources below : '' What causes congenital cardiovascular defects ? Congenital cardiovascular defects are present in about 1 percent of live births . They 're the most common congenital malformations in newborns . In most cases scientists do n't know why they occur . Sometimes a viral infection causes serious problems . German measles ( rubella ) is an example . If a woman contracts German measles while pregnant , it can interfere with how her baby 's heart develops or produce other malformations . Other viral diseases also may cause congenital defects.Heredity sometimes plays a role in congenital cardiovascular defects . More than one child in a family may have a congenital cardiovascular defect , but this rarely occurs . Certain conditions affecting multiple organs , such as Down 's syndrome , can involve the heart , too . Some prescription drugs and over-the-counter medicines , as well as alcohol and `` street '' drugs , may increase the risk of having a baby with a heart defect . Researchers are studying other factors . ''",0

I hope you do n't take this to be something of a cop-out answer . Light is itself an electromagnetic field that is carrying energy through space -- commonly called an electromagnetic wave or 'light ' . It is this wave that really makes things visible.Conversely , if you have no electromagnetic wave or one of an invisible wavelength , ( at least to the human eye ) then it wo n't bounce off of the object or if it does it wo n't be visible when it reaches you.The visible properties of an object are determined by how EM waves interact with the electrons near the surface of an object .

"what do you do for excessive mucus production ? I have excessive mucus production . I have two sinus surgerys , but the mucus was there befor the surgerys . It is so bad that it comes from my gums . I have a bad cough , it always produces a mouth full of mucus . It pockets in the back of my throat . It has gotten so bad that it disrupts my sleep . I take a cloth to bed each night to clean my mouth . If any one has ever had this problem , please let me know what you did for relife . I have spent a small fortune on doctors and medicine . As of now , no help . Thank you . I had the same problem , I could n't breathe through my nose because , my nose and mouth were constantly full of mucus and I was constantly spitting out this gunk . Sometimes , I would be choking and gagging in my sleep . A relative sent me a print-out of the side effects of the medication I was taking . It included breathing problems , mucus buildup , nodules ( which I now have exactly where my sinuses are ) and a lot of other dangerous side effects . I went off the med . and while I still have some mucus production it is no where near what it used to be . My doctor tried to get me to go back on the same med . even after I told him about the mucus problems it caused . He said it did n't do that . When I insisted that it did , he looked it up on his computer and then said `` if that happens again , you can always go off it '' . Needless to say , I refused to take it . Also , on one exam , the nurse told me I had polyps in my nose . She told me to see an ENT and have them removed ( surgically ) . I am glad I did n't . I just saw an M.D . on tv who said that when polyps in your nose are removed , they usually will come back . He said a safe non-surgical way to get rid of them is to use Nasonex twice a day and it is safe to do that . I think I 'll take his advice and try it . I do n't know why some doctors first advice is surgery especially if there is a non-surgical way to remedy a problem . I hope you find a solution to your problems .",0

"is buffy the vampire slayer postmodern ? if so why ? In a word , yes . The longer version is that BtVS is a piece of postmodern art because : '' In terms of popular culture and mass media , there has been a large push towards the postmodern tendency of `` bricolage , pastiche and intertextuality '' ( Altman , 1999:141 ) in recent years . In regards to BtVS , the series creator , Joss Whedon , has stated when he was forming the character of Buffy he thought of `` the little girl , the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed , in every horror movie . The idea of Buffy was to subvert that idea , that image , and create someone who was a hero where she had always been a victim . That element of surprise , that element of genre busting is very much at the heart of the series '' ( 2001 ) . The notion of `` genre busting '' is found in the postmodern mixing of horror , comedy and drama , and results in the playful deconstruction of genre conventions , forcing the audience to question their assumed knowledge of the 'rules ' of a particular genre , such as the formal repetitive structure of horror films ( Dika , 1987:87 ) '' Therefore , the primary reason why the show can be considered postmodern is that , from its very inception , the show was intended to flip and subvert the horror movie standard of the blonde girl being slain by the monster in the dark alley . BtVS also goes on to subvert standard readings of text and narrative by becoming extra-textual or outside of the text , by making transgressive allusions and references . Buffy 's postmodernism comprises not only self-awareness but also awareness of other shows , movies , books and anything else , including referring to Martha Stewart as a demon.Postmodernism also often defines itself by what it is not . In the case of Buffy , the show ( and its creator ) often defines itself by setting itself apart from something else . Thus , for instance , in Buffy many episodes , scenes or lines start with a cliché and then move on from it to subvert that cliché or exaggerate it in unconventional ways for dramatic purposes . This is demonstrated most clearly when a character questions a commonly used saying . For instance , in the season 2 episode , 'Lie to Me ' , Willow wonders why people say 'sticks out like a sore thumb ' : Xander : In no way do we stick out like sore thumbs . Willow : Okay , but do they really stick out ? Xander : What ? Willow : Sore thumbs . Do they stick out ? I mean , have you ever seen a thumb and gone , 'Wow ! That baby is sore ! ' Xander : You have too many thoughts.Another example is the show 's original conceit : the cliche that high school can be hell is given a postmodern twist by creating a show in which high school was literally on the mouth of hell .",0
"If jesus is Lord / God when he died on the cross who kept the universe in order ? Is the trinity false ? Excellent question . But unfortunately , I have yet to hear a good answer . God the Almighty Creator does n't even blink for a second , nonetheless die . If this were true and God died on the cross , then ALL existance would cease.Here 's what makes the trinity questionable : If you have a creature ( i.e . a created being ) , and a third of that creature dies while the other two-thirds are still alive , then that creature has n't really died . All parts would have to die for the creature to be considered dead . So if this applies to a created being , how can it not apply to the Creator ? If a third of God dies , but the other two-thirds are still alive , then that third did n't really die ; especially when he 's resurrected within a number of hours.The fact is that death in itself is a creation . Therefore the dimension of death can not be applied to an infinite entity which exists outside the realm of all creation . i.e . No creator , or any part of a creator , dies.What does that mean anyways ? What does it mean that a third of God has died ? ? ? This can only indicate that the trinity is not true ; it 's merely a pagan practice that has filtered down to blemish the noble message of Prophet Jesus ( peace be upon him ) . ( see link below ) For those who say angels , well who was sustaining the angels in God 's absence ? Did you really hear yourself say that ? ?",0

"how can i manually change an IRQ address for a pci card in WIN XP - it has to be possible ! ! ? i must address an add on PCI Paralell Port to IRQ 7 and DMA 3 in ECP Mode or this software that I have for my printer wont work .

I would not rely on being able to force XP to a specific IRQ - you never can be 100 % sure how PnP will act . However , I 've listed a couple suggestions . If you have already tried the following , I apologize in advance.In the Device Manager , select the printer port , and open it 's properties . Go to the Resources tab , and uncheck the `` Use autmatic settings '' checkbox . Change the `` Settings based on '' drop-down to `` Basic configuration n '' . Highlight the Interrupt Request option in the `` Resource settings '' list and click the Change button . Dial-in the IRQ you prefer . If the DMA option is provided as well , set it to 3 using the same process above.Otherwise , you may be able to force the IRQ and DMA in your system BIOS . If your BIOS has a Plug and Play configuration section , you can sometimes `` reserve '' specific IRQ 's and DMA 's for certain PCI slots . Please refer to your manufacturer 's specifications for details as there are several different BIOS options and I am not familiar with all of them .",0

"how are sedimentary rocks formed ? ? how are sedimentary rocks formed ? ? Sedimentary rocks can be divided into two major informal groups , referred to as clastics ( or siliciclastics ) and carbonates . Clastic rocks are formed by erosion of other rocks , igneous , metamorphic and sedimentary . These 'clasts ' can be mud , silt , sand , cobbles , or boulders , and are transported by wind , water , or gravity and accumulate where they eventually are buried and pressure and temperature subject them to diagenesis , the process that makes them from unconsolidated clasts to one rock mass . Shale , sandstone , and conglomerate are examples of clastics.Carbonates can work much differently since they form primarily in the oceans . Many carbonates are made from reefs and other living organisms that grow in the ocean . As these organisms die and leave behind their carbonate skeletons , rocks are formed . Other carbonates are formed from small grains called ooids , small balls that form by precipitating out of sea water , possibly with the help of bacteria or algae . Some ocean algae even form carbonate 'mud ' that eventually becomes hard rock . Another unusual group of sedimentary rocks are called evaporites . These are rocks like gypsum and rock salt that are deposited by evaporation of water in confined basins . The most fascinating part about sedimentary rocks is that they have a past , each one tells a story .",0

"How do I start the new Beta Yahoo Email ? This is what I found about Yahoo ! Mail Beta.====================================================Click on the below link to see how the Yahoo ! Email Beta looks like : http : //jeremy.zawodny.com/i/candygram-search.pngI 'm surprised that people are still emailing me to ask `` when are you gon na write something about the new Yahoo ! Mail ? `` I figured that with Walt Mossberg saying : I 've been comparing the new version of Yahoo Mail , which claims to be the leader in Web mail , with Gmail , the challenger Yahoo most fears . My verdict : The new Yahoo Mail is far superior to Gmail . Yahoo more closely matches the desktop experience most serious email users have come to expect ... .and PC Magazine saying : ... there 's no question that Yahoo ! is set to make a big leap forward with its new Web-based mail product . We 'll hold off on a rating until the official release or at least the full public beta , but from what we 've seen and tested so far , Yahoo ! 's competition may soon have some serious catching up to do ... .and the AP saying : Overall , I find Yahoo easier to use , and it 's quite impressive for a product that 's only weeks old . I expect even more features by the time a final version is released.Well , I figured that the cat was pretty well out of the bag : the new Yahoo ! Mail kicks a lot of ass . For lots of people out there , it 's going to be the first web-based replacement for Outlook or Outlook express they 've ever seen.And it 's got some serious `` WOW '' factor going for it . I still remember when Ethan turned on my access a few months ago . I was at home packing for my trip to Parowan when he gave me the URL . The interface loaded up and I just thought ... wow ! It was slower back then and has some bugs but it was already clear that it was going to move expectations up a level or two.Oh , and if you look at that screenshot , you 'll see that there are over 42,000 messages in my inbox . The product still works well with a big volume of mail.Now stop asking when I 'm gon na write about it ! : - ) BTW , It is a closed beta right now but that should change soon . In the meantime I 've asked the Yahoo ! Mail team if I could give out a few `` invites '' so faithful readers could try it out . No response yet , so no promises . But let me know if you think you could really use it ...",0

"sprained ankle ? I sprained my ankle training for a marathon during the summer & it still hurts to run . How come it 's taking so long to heal & are there any exercises I can do to help it along faster ? If an ankle sprain does not heal correctly , the joint may become unstable , resulting in a weakened and easily reinjured ankle . Proper initial care of your sprained ankle is critical . A compression wrap helps decrease swelling . If swelling is kept to a minimum , you will heal faster and get back on your feet sooner . Applying a compression wrap is easy and can be done at home . Elastic bandages are inexpensive and available at most drugstores . A protective brace can be worn over a compression wrap if you try to bear weight on your injured ankle . A compression wrap , such as an elastic ACE bandage , can hold the ankle in place and protect it from further injury . It also helps decrease swelling . A compression wrap should be worn for the first 24 to 36 hours.Also , try soaking it in hot water and epsom salts . I sprained both of mine playing football .",0

"What exactly is a black hole ? A blackhole is a collection of matter with gravity so immense that nothing can escape how strong the pull of it is unless when you are in it 's pull you can accelerate faster than the speed of light and beyond , thus the blackhole swallows up light as well.What happens is large masses collapse under their own weight . Think of a house of cards . The more you pile on , the greater the weight becomes until the cards on the bottom ca n't take the weight anymore . When the house of cards falls , the cards still exist but have lost their structure do to gravity.Now instead of a house of cards , replace that with an enormous sun that has tons of matter inside . The sun is teetering on the brink of collapsing as the matter inside grows and grows until eventually , like the house of cards , it falls down . Except since this is a sphere in space is is being pulled inward by it 's onw gravity , and not down like earth gravity , the sun does n't fall down , it falls IN.When this does happen the gravity does n't stop existing because the matter does n't either , it becomes smaller and the gravity grows as it pulls larger and larger amounts of matter into it 's core . Eventually it because so dense and so massive and so small that the gravity involved will not allow even Photons , or light particles , the fastest thing in the universe to pass through it.There ya have it !",0

"where did Billie Holiday go to school ? Sounds like school was a big part of her life , if any.Born Eleanora Fagan , she had a difficult childhood which affected her life and career . Much of Holiday 's childhood is clouded by conjecture and legend , some of it propagated by herself in her autobiography published in 1956 . She was born in Philadelphia but grew up in the Fells Point section of Baltimore . According to her autobiography , her house was the first on their street to have electricity . Her mother , Sadie Fagan , was just thirteen at the time of her birth ; her father Clarence Holiday , a jazz guitarist who would play for Fletcher Henderson , was fifteen . Billie Holiday 's parents married when she was three , but they soon divorced , leaving her to be raised largely by her mother and other relatives . A hardened and angry child , she dropped out of school at an early age and , allegedly , began working as a prostitute with her mother . This preceded her move to New York with her mother sometime in the early 1930s.There is controversy regarding Holiday 's paternity . This stems from a copy of her birth certificate in Baltimore archives that lists the father as a `` Frank DeViese '' . Some historians consider this an anomaly , probably inserted by a hospital or government worker ( See Donald Clarke , Billie Holiday : Wishing on the Moon , ISBN 0306811367 ) . Clarence Holiday accepted paternity , but was hardly a responsible father . In the rare times Billie did see him , she would shake him down for money by threatening to tell his then-girlfriend that Holiday was his daughter .",0

"Is it possible to continue to move forward and never reach a destination ? Example , if I draw a dot 10 spaces apart from each other , I begin at point A and move one full space towards point B ( now 9 full spaces away , but on every next move I take 1/2 of my previous move , i.e . after the next move point B is 8 1/2 spaces away . If I continue the movements at 1/2 increments of my proevious move , I am still moving forward but theoretically I never reach my destination which is a fixed point . Is that correct ? Does that mean that there are an infinite amount of numbers between 1 & 2 ? What you are describing is an infinite series using a decreasing geometric progression . The sum of such a series can be described by this proof : Let T = total distance traveled ( in spaces ) Then T = 1 + ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ... Also T - 1 = ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ... And if we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:2* ( T - 1 ) = 2* ( ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ... ) Multiplying through:2T - 2 = 1 + ( 1/2 ) + ( 1/4 ) + ( 1/8 ) + ( 1/16 ) ...

"Why is the color in a 50 year old movie so much better than in a new movie ? `` better '' is a very subjective term . Technicolor process films allowed for super-saturated colors to be seen in the final print . Currently there is n't any process similar to that in wide use . Technicolor used three strips of black and white film , each exposed through a filter ( red , green , blue ) to capture the original images . Then in a lab , each of the black and white strips were exposed against color film print stock with the same color filter . This process also led to occasional color mis-registration in some films where the lab work was rushed or done sloppily.Most modern films are shot on single-strips of negative with three dye layers of emulsion that are each sensitive to different color wavelengths . ( see the first link below ) A very popular film stock these days is Kodak 's 5279 `` vision 500T '' which has a very high ISO yet does n't get as grainy as previous high ISO films . ( see second link below ) Because films nowadays are shot on single-strip film , super-saturating colors requires post-processing for color-timing , such as digital intermediate processing ( see link 3 below for Discreet 's DI product info . ) Directors also like to have a lot of creative control over the look and feel of a film that is done through the color timing process ( see the 4th link , although the entry is incorrect as Pleasantville was the first film to be completely digitally color-graded in 1998 ) This can include adding hues or increasing or reducing contrast - good examples are in Cinderella Man and Lord of the Rings : ROTK",0
"Can there be a set which is the member of itself ? Please write the set.And show how . That is a very tricky concept.Let S be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves.Is S a member of S ?

"What will I have to pay in taxes on an annuity when I withdraw money at age 62 ? Annuities are investments . The portion of your withdrawal that represents your initial investment is withdrawn tax-free . All the earnings on your investment are taxed as ordinary income . This is summarized in IRS Tax Topic 410 ( first link below ) , and more fully detailed in IRS Publication 575 ( second link below ) .There 's no such thing as one-third is tax free , as another answer suggested.To give an over-simplified example : let 's say you invested $ 100,000 into an annuity . And now the annuity is worth $ 500,000 . The original $ 100,000 is returned to you tax-free , and the remaining $ 400,000 is taxable income . Annuities are designed to provide you income for life , and so you will be spreading your tax-free withdrawals over the entire period of your withdrawals.Spending an hour or so with a CPA should help you plan your retirement so that you minimize your taxes.All the best , William Pereztaxes.about.com",0

"Does anyone know anything about skydiving ? How about in Kansas ? There are actually five skydiving centers in Kansas ( see the United States Parachute Association web page http : //www.uspa.org/dz/states/KS.htm.I happen to be slightly bias , as I ’ m the Drop Zone Owner of one of the five ; Air Capital Drop Zone http : //www.aircapitaldropzone.com located 10 miles SE of Wichita Kansas.Basically there are two types of first jump ; Tandem , you ’ ll be attached with a Tandem Skydiving Instructor ( two people , one system ) . You ’ ll freefall from generally above 10,000 ’ down to between 5,000 ’ , and 6,000 ’ or approximately 30 seconds ( one mile at 120 mph ) . Round canopies are a thing of the past ; you ’ ll descend under a high performance rectangular wing ( ram air canopy ) to a soft landing . Cost generally ranges from the $ 170 range in Kansas , to $ 230 or so on the east or west coast.Solo , of which there are two forms being the old standard Static Line training method , and Accelerated Freefall ( AFF ) . For Static line you ’ ll have a 4 to 6 hour ground school , then you ’ ll jump from 4,000 ’ and your main parachute will start deployment as you fall away from the airplane . The “ accelerated ” in refers to the fact that you ’ ll freefall with a solo rig ( as opposed to tandem ) on your first jump . The ground training generally runs a couple of hours longer than the Static Line training , but you ’ ll exit from again above 10 ’ 000 ’ with two AFF instructors physically holding onto you for the freefall portion of your skydive . With both methods , once you ’ re under an open canopy , you ’ ll have assistance from the ground.There are methods which incorporate , and mix the methods . With “ Tandem Progressing ” you ’ ll be required to do a minimum of 3 tandem skydives , and then you ’ ll move into the AFF progression . The United States Parachute Association is the non government member association for skydiving in the US . You ’ re required to complete 25 freefalls to qualify for your first USPA license.Modern skydiving is very safe compared to its roots in the early days . Every skydiver is required to jump with two canopies ; a main and reserve . The main canopy malfunction rate is 1 in 1,000 +/- , and is generally related to the fact that they are cutting edge , high performance . The malfunction rate for reserves is in the range of wining the lottery . In the United States there are generally 20 to 30 skydiving fatalities ( of one million plus jumps ) , well in excess of 99 % of these fatalities are attributed to pilot error.MartinAC DZ",0

"How to test a prophet in the LAST DAYS - if he or she is true or a false ? See , i 'm newly converted and I read that GOD WILL POUR OUT HIS SPIRIT IN THE LAST DAYS on all flesh ? Is he gon na pour it on an unbeliever too ? since God says in `` ALL FLESH '' , your children will dream dreams and your daughters and sons will prophesy before the terrible day of God Almighty . So now , JESUS also made mention of FALSE PROPHETS . And our church has a prophet exclusively of their own.There has to be true prophets also in the Last DAYS as well with false prophets ... So which one is which ... ( Hope it 's OK i ask too many questions : ) hi.. First of all , I would like to congratulate you for choosing the way of Christ.I 'll try to answer your question to the best of my ability.I believe that when God speaks about All fleshin Joel 2:28 `` And i shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh ; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , your young men shall see visions . `` He meant the believers or someone who is being prepared for the Lord 's works.If you check sub chapters before that verse , God talks about A call to repentance and the land refreshed.The Lord obviously speaks about the people who repent and refreshed into the new creation in Christ ( believers ) .Thus , I conclude that All flesh , in Joel 2:28 , means All believersThat 's why it is important to always read at least a chapter or two before and after the verse.For the bible works as a whole ; we should avoid reading bible verses by chopping it individually . If we do that , there is a chance for us to take the verse out of the original context . And , yes there are still prophets appointed by God.and as it is true that there are true prophets , there are also false prophets/teachers.and your question is How we can tell the true from the false one , right ? there are 3 steps for us to know that a prophet is a false one or not:1 . God says `` My People perish from the lack of knowledge . '' It is very important for us to read the bible and pray everyday to build a sweet and intimate relationship with God . And also sharpen our knowledge about God 's characters.We know that Jesus has warned us about the false prophets/ messiahs in Matthew 24:24-28 . So , when there are news about messiahs that come to deliver us from sin , we knew that we have to be careful with those fake messiahs . We know in our heart that Jesus Christ is our only messiah that no one comes to the Father without going trough Him.2 . From reading the bible everyday and become more and more alert and sensitive to God 's voice , we knew that the true prophet sent by God will NEVER contradict the bible.So , when a teacher/prophets come to you and said that he is the messiah or something like you should divorce your husband , we know immediately that this prophet is a false teachers and should be avoided.Remember ! the bible is the ultimate guide that you should use to check whether a prophet is false or not.when they go against the bible , do n't waste your time.Pack your things and go.. Do n't bother listening to them.3 . What if the prophet looks and sounds fine for now ... but in the future , he will finally shown his true self . how do you know that he 's not going to trap you in his web of lies . For we know that the devil is cunning and deceitful.Well , go and look in matthew 7 : 15-20.It is okay and even recommended to test those people.Do n't accept them immediately just because they said they are prophets.Do n't be rude to them , but keep your Spiritual alert system on all the time.Test the fruits and the labors . For the things that came from the Lord always bring forth peace and goodness.Take whatever good and biblical inside . but , disregard the weird teachings . Keep alert and pray all the time for the Holy Spirit to reveal the truth to you about those prophets . Hopefully that helps , In jesus name , Amen",0

The Bible also says every good thing comes from God . So a spiritual gift is any good thing a person can have ( All we have is given to us by God ) . So that can include talents , skills and other blessings . For example a person with musical talent has a gift of music , a being good with children would also be a gift . God gives us all kinds of gifts and they can all be used for His glory if we allow them to . vs. 12-31 goes on to talk about these gifts . Any gift can apply here .",0

"What is the difference between a desktop and a workstation ? I am thinking about alienware , any suggestions. ? I need lots of computing power w/ the option of using for media/games . Systems about $ 1500 . There may have been a distinction between a desktop and a workstation in the past but there 's only a faint gray line that differentiates the two today . A workstation can do anything a consumer desktop can and vice versa . So essentially , they mean the same thing.If you ask Dell or Alienware , however , they 'll probably say workstations are for business and desktops are for consumers . For computer manufacturers , a workstation usually means some of the latest technology . They tend to have SATAII , beefier minimum RAM than deskops , and stronger processors for their `` base systems '' . Of course , you could always configure a base consumer desktop with all of that , so the distinction is moot.If you look carefully , though , there may be one or two small differences . Workstations may prefer to use more expensive ECC RAM . Their video cards may be ISV-certified and use `` workstation-level '' video graphic cores ( nVidia Quadro instead of GeForces , ATI FireGL instead of Radeons ) . And almost always , their starting configurations tend to use a CDROM ( cause , you know , why would you need a DVD burner for work ? ! ) .Again , all of this can be changed . You can buy a workstation with a DVD burner , you can stick in a GeForce 7800GTX , and most likely you can use non-ECC RAM ( check motherboard requirements first though ) .So if you 're an avid gamer and need a good media machine , something from Alienware should do just fine . Personally I would choose a no-frills basic model like Dell 's XPS400 or E510 , get memory from Crucial.com ( or a good local store ) , and buy the video card from NewEgg.com . I 'm not familiar with molecular modeling programs but I would ask around if they are multi-processor enabled applications ( which means can more than one processor be recognized by the program ) . If so , you may want to get a dual-core processor as the modeling program can take advantage of the extra core and help with the number crunching . If not , then choosing a regular single-core CPU would suit you fine and save some cash ( it would be money wasted as games do n't effectively use a second core ) . For RAM , ask around about your modeling program because it would be primarily your task . For games , you 'll want at least 1GB of RAM . For video cards , I would chose whatever your budget allows you . The Nvidia 6600/6800/7800 lines are really good right now and I would n't suggest any ATIs at the moment except for the top-of-the-line X850/X1800 .",0

"Why is the ocean blue ? It might sound like i 'm joking.. But i really need to know . Is it because it 's reflecting off the sky ? Water is faint blue . Although water appears clear in small quanities ( like a glass of water ) , the blue color becomes visible the more water we look through . Thus , deep lakes and seas are bluer than a shallow river.Other factors can affect the color we see : 1 . Particles and solutes can absorb light , as in tea or coffee . Green algae in rivers and streams often lend a blue-green color . The red sea has occasional blooms of red Trichodesmium erythraeum algae . 2 . Particles in water can scatter light . The Colorado river is often muddy red because of suspended reddish silt in the water . Some mountain lakes and streams with finely gound rock , such as glacial flour , are tourquise . Light scattering by suspended matter is required in order that the blue light produced by water 's absorption can return to the surface and be observed . Such scattering can also shift the spectrum of the emerging photons toward the green , a color often seen when water laden with suspended particles is observed . 3 . The surface of seas and lakes often reflect blue skylight , making them appear bluer . [ [ [ Montana reflection . ] ] ] The relative contribution of reflected skylight and the light scattered back from the depths is strongly dependent on observation angle .",0

"What is the metal from which penny coins are made of ?

( Note : In 1943 , the coin 's composition was changed to zinc-coated steel . This change was only for the year 1943 and was due to the critical use of copper for the war effort . However , a limited number of copper pennies were minted that year . You can read more about the rare , collectible 1943 copper penny in `` What 's So Special about the 1943 Copper Penny . '' ) * In 1962 , the cent 's tin content , which was quite small , was removed . That made the metal composition of the cent 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc . * The alloy remained 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc until 1982 , when the composition was changed to 97.5 percent zinc and 2.5 percent copper ( copper-plated zinc ) .

If they 're just some random person , why do you care what they think ? If you care about them , but they 're angry , they probably do n't mean it . # 3 : Take it in perspective . Just because you can improve on something does n't mean you 're not a great person. # 4 : Tell the person how you feel . Sometimes people do n't mean to be as harsh as they are , or assume that you 're not bothered .",0

It will be a word that you should have been studying in class.Ie. , Adaptation - mutations that give an organism an advantageMutation - alterations in genetic makeupEvolution - changes in organisms over time due to adaptationNatural Selection - conditions which select adaptationsI would go with adaptation , but no guarantees . The concept here is that as we take antibiotics we kill a lot of bacteria , but not all of them . The remaining few that survive are the `` tougher '' ones , at least ones that are n't affected as much by the antibiotics . These remaining bacteria may continue to grow in numbers . If they ever succeed in infecting more people , the antibiotics will now do nothing.P.S ... A lot of people think that bacteria randomly mutate until one of them becomes resistant . This is only part of the story . Antibiotics almost always originate from other bacteria , or some other organism trying to fend off bacteria . These antibiotics are not new , just new to medicine . Bacteria have been resisting these antibiotics for millions of years . Maybe not actively , but somewhere in their past it has probably been encountered . Yet another reason why a one-word answer just does n't cut it .",0

Not knowing the details , it is tough to answer , but there are various types of women out there , and for some , trust is everything . If you did enough to make her leave you , it must have been pretty bad . I would assume ( since I do n't know the circumstances ) that either there have always been trust issues , or that your infidelity ( of whichever type ) was long standing and ongoing , and so she felt betrayed . In both cases , I do n't know if there is anything you could do . If she left because of pure emotional reaction , you might have a chance , but if it was an intellectual decision , it is not likely to work . Emotion can be reasoned with - an overreaction can be dealt with , but logic is usually rock solid . You could offer therapy for you both , however if you are already 'divorced ' , it seems a little too final to try that . Apologies alone wo n't really get you anywhere . Not much of an answer , but without any details , it 's the best I 've got . My main advice though is to know when to give up . Some battles ca n't be won . At some point , you might have to just count your losses , consider this an expensive learning experience , and do n't make the same mistake next time .",0

"How people judge people ? do you judge people by looks , personality , way-of thinking ... Initially , people judge people by appearance and actions , because these are the first things that you can observe about someone . You can judge this up close or from a distance . People usually judge based on comparing another person to their own appearance , and how much the appearance differs from their own appearance.If someone takes the time to get to know someone , they will judge a person on `` deeper '' issues : intelligence , ways of spending time , ways of treating others , and beliefs . Of course , these again are perceived by the person that is doing the judging , and they 're usually compared to their own characteristics/beliefs.Should people judge people ? Yes , and no . It 's good to have standards that you expect of people , in terms of how you are treated , and standards of common decency . However , one should keep in mind that this world would be a boring place if we were all the same , and that everyone does not have the same experiences that you have . So , although judging is hard to avoid , you have to control what you do with your judgements . And it 's always good to reassess what you think of someone . Try to get to know people better .",0

"is carbohydrates good for building muscles ? well my friend IMHO I can answer you that pretty well . Carbs are the fuel for your muscle when you work out . The best carbs during the day are complex carbs like sweet potato and oatmeals , and veggies . When you are about to workout , during workout and right after finishing your training are simple carbs with fast digesting protein . Best bet is a combination ( 50:50 of glucose and dextrose ) and whey protein . If you really want to educate your self in proper nutrition for building muscle I recommend you google John Berardi website and www.burnthefat.com you will learn a lot and with time , will power and patience you will achieve an awesome body like I have done .

"why are banks for coins called piggy banks ? In Middle English , `` pygg '' referred to a type of clay used for making various household objects such as jars . People often saved money in kitchen pots and jars made of pygg , called `` pygg jars '' . By the 18th Century , the spelling of `` pygg '' had changed and the term `` pygg jar '' had evolved to `` pig bank . '' This name may have caught on because the pig banks were mostly used by children , and the pig is a child-friendly shape that is easy to fashion out of clay . The actual origin of the name bears no relation to the pig itself.What also helped to start the change from jar to pig was during the 18th century , an order of 200 `` pygg '' jars was sent for by a shop owner . The person on the receiving end of this letter did not understand and hand crafted 200 coin holders that were shaped like pigs . When this order was received they were shelved and sold very quickly . The new pig shaped coin holder became popular . Once the shop had run out of stock , they sent off for more pig-shaped coin holders .",0

"What is a worm , trojan ? and how is it different from a computer virus ? Trojan horse is a malicious program that is disguised as legitimate software.A Trojan horse program has a useful and desired function , or at least it has the appearance of having such . In most cases the program performs other , undesired functions , but not always . The useful , or seemingly useful , functions serve as camouflage for these undesired functions . The kind of undesired functions are not part of the definition of a Trojan Horse ; they can be of any kind.In practice , Trojan Horses in the wild often contain spying functions ( such as a packet sniffer ) or backdoor functions that allow a computer , unbeknownst to the owner , to be remotely controlled from the network , creating a `` zombie computer '' . Because Trojan horses often have these harmful functions , there often arises the misunderstanding that such functions define a Trojan Horse.The basic difference from computer viruses is : a Trojan horse is technically a normal computer program and does not possess the means to spread itself . Originally Trojan horses were not designed to spread themselves . They relied on fooling people to allow the program to perform actions that they would otherwise not have voluntarily performed . Trojans of recent times also contain functions and strategies that enable their spreading . This moves them closer to the definition of computer viruses , and it becomes difficult to clearly distinguish such mixed programs between Trojan horses and viruses .",0

Why does the same side of the moon always face us ? Our moon is locked in what is known as a geo-synchronous orbit . For millions of years the angular momentum has stablized the moon to provide very little loss of energy between earth and moon .

"What are the basic differences that separate Roman Catholicism and Protestantism ? I think a major difference is that Protestants believe that you can not get to heaven on your own merit , that you must confess your sins and trust in Jesus as God 's son who died as a sacrifice for your sins ; they believe that you can not avoid sin on your own , that you must rely on Jesus as a redeemer , but that you will want to do good works out of appreciation for God 's salvation through Jesus . I think that Roman Catholics believe that you must acknowledge that Jesus is God 's son , but also that you have to do good works to get to heaven.From what I understand , Protestants believe that you can/should directly ask Jesus to forgive your sins , while Roman Catholics believe that you can/should confess your sins to a priest , who will in turn be your `` intercessor '' to Jesus/God . Also , Protestants believe that only Jesus/God/Holy Spirit are holy and that the Virgin Mary ( Jesus ' mother ) or other `` saints '' are just regular people , saved by God 's grace/Jesus . Roman Catholics believe that the Virgin Mary and other `` saints '' are holy , and can be prayed to for miracles or forgiveness.For the most part , I think that Protestants believe that when you die , you will go to heaven or hell . Roman Catholics believe that you might go to purgatory ( where you are `` purged '' of your sins before you get into heaven ) . I think there 's also `` Limbo , '' which is a place where babies can go if they have n't been able to comprehend the choice between heaven and hell.There are , of course , a lot of different divisions within Protestant and Roman Catholic faiths , so a lot of these are generalizations , and will not necessarily apply to a Protesant or Roman Catholic person 's personal beliefs .",0

"Does conditioner damage hair ? Does regularly using conditioner contribute to alopecia ( receding harline ) ? *Noddling solemnly* While many disagree I have to say yes , chemicals ( even in conditioners and shampoos ) can damage hair . One should only wash their hair often enough to keep it clean . Daily doses can over do it , especially if you use the rinse and repeat method.Now I can not say if this is the cause of your problem , but beware products that contain alcohol or lauryl sulphate as they dry out hair and make it brittle.Most people routinely lose between 70 and 150 hairs from their scalp each day , mainly through washing , brushing , and combing.Scalp hair starts to thin when more hairs are lost through normal shedding than the scalp is able to renew . About 40 % of the density of scalp hair has to be lost before thinning of the hair becomes noticeable.Hair loss can be caused by : * Heredity . Most balding is caused by a genetic predisposition - in other words , it 's part of a person 's genetic makeup . This is called male pattern baldness , or hereditary balding or thinning . It is the most common cause of thinning hair . * Illness , certain physical conditions , or their treatments . This can include high fever , thyroid disease , childbirth , inadequate protein in the diet , iron deficiency , cancer treatments , the use of certain medications , and other causes.For more see http : //www.ehealthmd.com/library/hairloss/HL_whatis.htmlSome good alternatives are found here http : //www.answerbag.com/c_view.php/1654",0

'' [ 1 ] ) . These immigrants brought with them a very distinct style of English speaking , which was then combined with the African languages spoken by the African Americans who were at this time enslaved in the South . Over time this cultural and linguistic diversity combined with the South 's rural isolation , and longtime use and familiarity with the King James Version of the Bible in religious life , to produce a unique American dialect .",0

"How faithful is the modern Bible to the original texts ? Please give me real information , not dogma. ? Great question . Depends on what you mean by `` modern '' ?

"the refs ... ? Is anybody else tired of all these Seahawks fans complaining about the refs ? I mean most of their calls were the right calls .

Seattle might have gotten a couple of bad calls on critical plays that might have swung momentum in their favor , but when the ball was in their hands , they pretty much dropped it every time ( hint , hint ) .

"my mother has fibromyalgia , anyone have ideas on treatments ? she currently uses heat and pain pills I have had Fibro since I was 16 and am now almost 36 . I have seen more doctors over the years than I can count from Neurologists to Rhuematologists to Chiropractors to Psychiatrists to Pain Specialists . In my experience pain medications do not work . A muscle relaxant is much more helpful . I have also tried biofeedback , steroid shots , trigger point injections , two sleep studies , nerve blocks , accupuncture , foot braces , wrist braces , carpal tunnel release surguries , and so much more . All just torture and I felt like a guinea pig.My best advise is make sure to get plenty of sleep , take a multiple vitamin , keep active in at least low impact sports , and consider Magnesium and Malic Acid supplements ( consult the doctor or a nutritionist to have her Magnesuim level checked- it is a simpe mouth swab and not painful ) , meditation does help some in keeping the pain back if you can seperate your mind from the pain , and try to take 2-3 warm Epson Salt baths a week ( Epson salt contains Magnesium and soaking in a warm tub of it helps to get the mineral into the body . Magnesium aids the muscles in using oxygen and when the level is low which is typical in Fibro it can cause are cramps , spasms , and pain . ) Also , Fibromyalgia is a neurotransmitter disorder and certain foods can trigger similiar symptoms to Fibro . Try to have her eliminate Monsodium Glutamate from her diet . I did and some of my symptoms ( chronic headaches and nausea ) went away . It is in everything from Doritos to chicken soup . A few key finding 's of an FDA study found MSG to cause a `` burning sensation in the back of the neck , forearms and chest '' . Otherwise , learn your limits and pace herself.Good luck !",0

My pants fit at the waist , but I always have 2 pudgy blobs hangin ' over the back of my pants . Is there a miricle diet that targets that area ? j/k or An exercize that can take care of them ? The only way to reduce love handles is to reduce your overall body fat level . Unfortunately many people have certain limited areas where fat tends to deposit first and go away last . There is nothing you can do about this . It is controlled by genetics and may change with age . You may be able to make it look beter by developing the underlying muscles . A good all round weight training program coupled with a reasonable diet is the best plan . Another exercise that affect the underlying muscles are hanging , twisting knee or leg raises . I 'd recommend doing ses of high reps ( 50-100 or more ) .",0

"Are there any Biblical verses that refute Mormon teachings ? Please explain. ? Way too many . Here is a good link to do some research.http : //www.carm.org/mormon.htmMormons not only claim to be Christians , but to be the only true Christians . According to them , the early Christian church went through an apostacy , lost the true teaching of God , and is built on a Bible that , according to them , is translated incorrectly and is missing many books.Interestingly , while LDS Church president Gordon Hinckley assures the press that `` the New Testament is a fundamental scripture for us , '' ( Note 1 ) he fails to point out the Mormons ' bias against the Bible.Article 8 of the Mormon Articles of Faith ( Note 2 ) says , `` We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it has been translated correctly . '' This approach allows Mormons to ignore key Bible Scriptures which refute Mormon doctrines . Bible verses used to counter Mormon teachings are brushed off in favor of passages from the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scriptures ( as well as ongoing revelation that often contradicts previous LDS Church teachings ) .It should be noted that the LDS Church has published its own version of the King James Bible , incorporating footnotes explaining what corrections from Joseph Smith 's `` inspired version '' of the Bible ( a version full of errors and plagiarized material ) should be taken into account.However , in spite of their efforts at revisionism , Mormons have not been able to support their claims . On the contrary . While Mormon allegations regarding the Bible and the course of Christianity are refuted by history , archeology , and other sciences , the scriptures of the Mormon church are problematic at every turn . Far from showing us so-called 'restored truth , ' they are testimonies to the deceptive nature of Mormonism .",0
"If homosexuals were acceptable in society ... would they eventually die out ? Because if homosexuals were kept in the closet then they would be passing on their genes ... etc .

Your point is an interesting one : that gays currently have to pretend to be straight , and therefore they have heterosexual sex and reproduce , against their natural inclination . If they did not have to hide their sexuality , they would be much less likely to reproduce.The only weakness in your argument is the assumption that homosexuality is entirely genetic - this has never been proven .",0

"How does one become a taxidermist ? I am looking for a career , but I can not and will not learn Algebra . Any suggestions ? IntroductionTaxidermy programs prepare people to create lifelike models of wildlife and fish . Students learn how to select materials from dead animals and how to use artificial resources such as glass , wax , and foam . They study methods to create needed parts and care for models . In addition , they learn to manage a business and advertise their services.OverviewThe Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti once said that `` the object of art is not to reproduce reality , but to create a reality of the same intensity . '' As an art form , taxidermy does exactly this.Contrary to popular belief , taxidermists do not take dead animals and stuff them for display . Although this practice used to exist , most taxidermists would frown upon this mere attempt to `` reproduce reality . '' Instead , taxidermists are artists who re-create `` a reality of the same intensity '' by using a combination of artificial resources and natural materials from animal corpses.If you 've ever been to a museum of natural history or science , you may have seen the work of a taxidermist . You might have seen the form of an antelope 's head mounted on wood or a lifelike representation of a jackrabbit in a setting crafted to look like a forest clearing.As a taxidermist , you help to preserve the memory of animals . Just as other artists do , you pay close attention to details that others might not notice . You look at color , texture , expression , and muscle movement . You combine crafts such as carpentry , woodworking , tanning , and molding and casting to give renewed life to these details . You also use the artistic talent required for drawing , sculpting , and painting.You might show your work at competitions , in shops and museums , or in the private homes of your customers.In taxidermy programs , you learn to build frames and forms to substitute for animal skulls and skeletons . You study the techniques for sculpting clay heads or bodies and finishing models with painting and preservation . You also learn to preserve animal components such as skin , feathers , and fur.Proprietary schools and some community colleges offer taxidermy programs . You can typically earn a certificate which takes anywhere from a few weeks to a year of full-time study after high school . ''",0

"what is `` strain ? '' ? Strain describes the % change in length of an object in the same direction of the load . Strain is almost always used with the word stress which is the reason there is strain . Stress is a force distributed over an area . If you take a 1/2 '' diameter steel pin and it is 1 '' long and you put 100 lbs on one end and the other end on the ground , you put 100lbs/.20in*in or 500 psi into the pin . Now visualize the pin being crushed under this load . The 1 '' distance between the end faces is no longer 1 '' . Say a measurement shows that under this load the pin is 0.998 '' . The strain , measured in inches per inch , is the change .002 '' divided by the length . In this case .002/1=.002 inches per inch . So the strain would be .002 in/in . ( In real life , the strain from a 100 lb load on a steel 1/2 '' pin would be very difficult to measure . ) See Poisson 's ratio which specifically deals with the different strain rates based on material properties .",0

"How can there be many ways to God ? Let not your heart be troubled : ye believe in God , believe also in me .

Can it be shown in any other writings from God ? If it can not be shown , why not ? May God bless you all for your answers..In Jesus Most Precious Name..EyeLovesJesus For those who say there are many ways because there are so many people I respectfully disagree . The is only one God and one Way . Do most know that the early church was actually called The Way ? Why because the followed the One who said there is only One Way that being Christ . How can there be many ways when they are all so different . Some say works , some sacrafice , some even say self reliance . But consider this if God is perfect can you stand before Him ? Can you say let me in for I am a rightous man on my own certinly not . So then we need to be perfect before the Father . Can we do anything to be perfect ? Certinly not . For being a christian will not get you into heaven , on the contary being a christian will get you no where . Jesus on the other hand can stand before the Father , He can be Rightous and Holy before God on your behalf . But not if you do not accept Him for what He is and for what He has done . For on the day of judgment ( there will be judgement ) The Father will judge all men and see whom is in His Son and they shall be forgiven . Only one way to heaven , thank the Lord we have a way .

"Why does the days in the Georgian Calendar differ with the dates every year ? ? The traditional Chinese one isnt The traditional Chinese calendar does not contain “ weeks ” . In ancient China government officials enjoyed a day off for every ten days . The week system was introduced into China , I guess , only in early last century along with the Gregorian calendar . According to the Chinese calendar , a year has 12 months and a month has 29 or 30 days . If a month has 29 days , we call it the lesser month ; if 30 days – the greater month . Each of the 12 months of a certain year can be lesser or greater , depending on the astronomical calculation . There is no special name to each month ; they are identified by the ordinal numbers ( 1 to 12 ) . If you want to know , for example , whether the second month of the next Chinese year ( or lunar year ) is a lesser or greater one , you have to consult an almanac or a perpetual calendar . There is an intercalary month arranged for every three years ( approximately ) . An intercalary year has 13 months . That ’ s the outline of the Chinese calendar . And it may be obvious that the Chinese calendar can not match its dates to the week 's days .",0

"I need to know the physics behind a helicopter 's flight. ? I need to know how a helicopter flies ( with equations , if possible ) and the possible problems a helicopter may experience in-flight . Thanks . Well , the physics of a helicopter is a very complex subject , but in essence it is only the blades of the helicopter pushing air down on the ground to lift it . The reason it starts to become complex is because the weight of the helicopter is thrown into the equation and the blades of it work in circular motion . The helicopter does have a coefficient of friction against it , which does not help the simplicity . The blades are angled to enhance the lift momentum . they´re 3 types of blades for helicopters and planes : BLADES WITH NO ANGLE ATACK , WITH SLIGHT ANGLE ATACK AND WITH STEP ANGLE ATACK.Also the blades spin in one direction , forcing the helicopter to actually spin in the other direction : Without the rear blade the helicopter would just spin due to Newton 's third law and action-reaction forces . The third law states that `` when one object exerts a force on a second object , the second exerts a force on the first that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction '' Action-Reaction forces means that for every force that the blades exerts , the body of the helicopter will spin proportional.The Rotor , blades in the rear , keep the helicopter going straight . They always oppose the force made by the blades.IN THE SOURCE PAGE I GAVE YOU YOU´LL FIND ALL THE EQUATIONS AND ANSWERS YOU NEED ABOUT THIS TOPIC .",0

"What should I expect if I become a single parent. ? Explain the hardships and the joys of single parenting . What should I expect out of my future former spouse ? He is of the bullying , mentally abusive breed to both the kids and I . It really depends on whether you have a helpful , concerned family around and some close friendships . It 's also a consideration if you have work skills or not . Your standard of living usually goes down with a divorce so you may need to take some classes and find a career that will interest and support you and your children.It can be an exhilerating thing to walk out of an abusive marriage and go out on your own without fear . Making preparations before leaving will be a good thing in the long run . Perhaps , you would want to ask him to visit a marriage counselor with you a few times before deciding absolutely .

"Themal Energy ? Whats the maximum amount of ice a 3500 J/s hair dryer could melt in one minute ? The question asked for the MAXIMUM amount of ice , so we have to assume that the ice is at the freezing/melting temperature . Any lower temperature and it wo n't be the maximum amount of ice because some of the heat is wasted bringing the temperature of the ice up to the freezing/melting point.3500 J/s * 60s = 210,000JWater 's heat of fusion = 334 J/gTotal ice which can be melted = 210,000J / 334J/g = 628.74g",0

"Why does society treat us as a unisex ? According to biological studies men and women are different in physical makeup , hormones , and even brain activity . According to psychological studies men and women have different wants , needs , and desires . Where some are the same they often have different priority levels.So , why does western culture treat us as a unisex ? That we are all supposed to be the same and teats down people who accept those distinct difference ? Western culture treats us as equal because of the ERA , womens rights movements , and feminist groups that demand equality . Unfortunately , there seems to be an either/or side-effect . We are either unisex beings with no differences , or we become stereotypes of man/woman . There is no middle ground yet because the politically correct crowd is afraid of stepping on toes .",0
"Why do we fasten steel decks to the top flanges of steel members on a typical light industrial roof ? Where else would you fasten them ? If you 're thinking the bottom- then yeah , you could , except when there is weight on deck , it would be transferred to the steel member through tension on the fastener , which would ultimately limit your maximum strength . You would n't want a huge beam and a rigid deck and have your ultimate strength dependent on the fastener . Therefore , you secure the deck to the top of the member , so the fastener is just there for shear instead of tension forces .",0

"would ypu prefer win 98 or XP ? It depends on 2 things : what kind of hardware you have and what sort of things you do with your computer.HARDWARE : It is safe to say that most PCs sold today can carry the weight of WinXP , plus the load of MS Office XP/2003 and browsing Internet . But if you are still using a 5 or more year-old PC with 128MB or less RAM , you are better off using Win98 . Another issue you might need to know is that whether the PC comes with any USB socket ( which is very common nowadays but not before 2000 , not in developing countries anyway ) and whether you want to use it if it does have one . WinXP makes it easier to use USB devices , whereas Win98 does not comes with any USB driver . ( A 3rd-party native USB driver for win98 can be found at http : //rapidshare.de/files/1217842/nusb22e.exe.html ) WHAT YOU DO : First off , if you are to play any current PC games , go for WinXP . If you are to do any kind of graphics intensive applications like any of the Adobe family software , video editing and encoding , CAD/CAM system , etc. , all of which require a lot of memory size , go for WinXP ( since it can address a higher RAM size ) . If you need an EASY ( without installing any 3rd-party driver ) way to transfer files from and to USB devices ( like flash drives , digital cameras , mobile MP3 players , mobile harddisks , etc . ) go for WinXP . If you only need it for typing some documents/letters , browsing the web , and listening to audio CDs , you can stick with Win98 . If you have some legacy software written to run on Win98 only ( such as customised accounting package ) , stick to Win98.Of course there are many other more specific issues can be considered , but the above can serve as a basic guideline . I hope this help .",0

You might find this an ambigious question , but thats the point ... .. Humans have a tendency to glorify their personal ignorance . Those of us in the United States seem to excel at this .

"Which is better , AMD or Intel ? I know for a fact that AMD is much better than Intel ! AMD 's processors run a lot faster and cooler . A cooler running processor is important . Not only does it mean that AMD processors have a faster clock speed than comparable Intel products but AMDs also have a longer life expectancy as well . Plus AMD costs quite a bit less than their Intel counterparts . AMD is also ahead on the technology curve as well . They were the first company to introduce the 64-bit PC processor many months ahead of Intel ’ s 64-bit processor . This is why I believe that AMD will possibly out live Intel.I 've had both brands and nobody can even come close AMD ’ s speed and power ! I am running a newer AMD Sempron 3000+ with 512 MB of memory and Windows 2000 Professional SP4 for my operating system and this combination works great.From now on AMD , is the only processor for me .

"do u think that lies saves u from bein ur self ? I do n't think I would use the word 'saves ' . I 'll ignore your grammar and spelling and whatnot and try to answer what I think you might be asking.To say that lies 'save ' you from being yourself implies that you do n't like who you are and that you think that the fabrications are better than reality . In fact , it 's the opposite . Lies , if you tell them often , do separate you from who you really are in that they are false , and provide the one you 're lying to with a false impression of you . They tend to amalgamate until you 're boxed in by your own stories . They start to add up and keeping them all straight is difficult , and there are almost always discrepancies . If you lie too much , it can make people hate you for deceiving them . If there 's something you do n't like about your life , so much as to lie about it , then I would suggest changing who you are instead . Fix it , and then you can be honest with everyone , yourself included.However , if you must lie , I would stay as absolutely close to the truth as possible . It makes them that much more believable .",0

".SINCE CUSTOMERS KNOWN THEIR NEED AND WANTS THERE IS NO NEED FOR MARKETING DISCUSS ? Lets assume customers know all the products available in the market place . Most often there exists similar or substitute products in the market for example the chocolate market , Cadburys vs Nestle or in the soft drinks market Coca Cola vs Pepsi Cola or the car market . How would a potential buyer choose what brand to buy since it ’ s the same product ? To answer this question we must think in marketing terms such as the 4 p ’ s which are product , price , place and promotion . Price communicates a lot about the product such as , expensive means that the product is of the highest quality . Or cheap which can say – buy lots of me but don ’ t give it to your loved ones as a birthday present . Promotion is used to get customers to hear about the product and get them to try it . Product promotion is a strategy used to increase sales , increase product/brand awareness or get rid of stock . A product promotion could be a BOGOF ( buy one get one free ) , by one get second half price , money off coupons , etc . These strategies are used to get customers to buy more of your product or simply try it for the first time.Marketing is the process of exchanging products or the art of persuading people to buy your product . I said exchange because a customer will exchange money for the product they are buying , with so many me too products in the market place a business has to do all it can to convince customers that their product is better than the competition for whatever reason , that ’ s the art of Marketing . Coming up with the right products , setting the right prices , selling the product in the best and most convenient places ( having the product available for purchase ) , communicating the product to the public and convincing customers that your product is better then the competition is the art of selling .",0

"How are geodes formed , where are found and what minerals do they contain ? Geodes ( Greek geoides , `` earthlike '' ) are geological formations common to the United States ( Indiana , Iowa , and Kentucky ) , Brazil , and Mexico . Essentially rock bubbles with internal crystal formations , the exterior of a geode is generally limestone or a related rock , while the interior contains quartz crystals and/or chalcedony deposits . Other geodes are completely filled with crystal , being solid all the way though . These types of geodes are called nodules.Geologists do not yet have a widely accepted theory about how geodes are formed , but it is believed geodes can form in any cavity that is buried . These can be bubbles in igneous rocks , pockets under tree roots , bubbles in lava after a volcanic eruption , or even animal burrows . Over time , the external wall of the cavity hardens , and dissolved silicates and/or calcites are deposited on the inside surface . Over time , this slow feed of minerals allows crystals to form inside the hollow chamber . Then , over millions of years , the geode makes its way back to the surface through normal geologic processes.Follow the link for more information.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geode",0
"Why does TV always show gangsters and thugs holding pistols sideways ? Why does TV always show gangsters and thugs holding pistols sideways instead of the proper vertical orientation ? Is it just for the `` cool '' factor ? The same reason they hold microphones clear to the top thereby losing much of the useful pickup characteristics designed into the microphone . One person does it and someone thinks it 's cool then the next one does it and so on . Nevermind the fact that the sideways orientation of the firearm makes accuracy nearly impossible and kickback from the firearm dangerous , not to mention ejected hot shell casings will fly up into your face and go down your shirt that is cooly unbuttoned . How about the baggy pants that make running impossible , or the light up tennis shoes that make it easy for a police officer to follow a perp in the dark . Much of `` cool '' fashion is so foolish it 's laughable . I still have n't even figured out why the vocalists keep grabbing their crotch area then pointing at the audience while taking giant steps sideways . What is the most absurd about all of this is that all of the people following in lockstep repeating all of this crap are convinced that they are rugged individualists expressing their own unique personality . In reality they are simply reflecting what they have seen on the big glass brain stealer ( That 's TV ) . Well I got ta go now . It 's time for me to put on my stocking cap .

The orientation of the gun does nothing to affect the flight of the bullet other than make it difficult to aim .

Maybe they should hold it upside down so it will fly out backwards and the flat back end of the bullet leave a bigger hole ?",0

"Does anyone have and want to share a routine to calculate fourier coefficient for even Mathieu 's Function Calc Classes of Solutions to Mathieu 's Equation Floquet 's theorem asserts that any solution to the Mathieu equation ( Eq . gif ) is of the form : [ 4,29,28 ] where is either real or imaginary and is a -periodic functiongif of . This assertion implies that solutions of Eq . gif can be separated into the product of a term of the form and a series of harmonics , , each of which is -periodic in .

Functions of fractional order are obtained for . The oscillatory periods of the frequencies associated with fractional-order Mathieu functions are non-integer multiples of . The special case of corresponds to an -periodic ( in terms of ) solution . These -periodic solutions are Mathieu functions of integral order.All bounded solutions to the Mathieu equation -- - those of fractional as well as integral order -- - are described ( in accordance with Floquet theory ) by an infinite series of harmonic oscillations whose amplitudes decrease with increasing frequency : The argument of in Eq . gif represents harmonics of frequency , while the term represents a ( secular ) frequency which is a function of the trap specifications ( or , equivalently , of the Mathieu parameters a , q ) .

A Masters degree will be another 2yrs , and a PhD another 4-5yrs . The more schooling you finish , the more you 'll be paid , basically . But also the more responsibility you will have . With a BS you can get a job doing bench chemistry at a variety of businesses , including pharmaceutical companies , cosmetics , and personal hygeine companies among others .

"who is guru ? The syllable gu means shadowsThe syllable ru , he who disperses them , Because of the power to disperse darknessthe guru is thus named.A guru ( गुरू Sanskrit ) is a teacher in Hinduism , Buddhism or Sikhism . Based on a long line of philosophical understanding as to the importance of knowledge , the guru is seen in these religions as a sacred conduit , or a way to self-realization . In India and among people of Hindu , Buddhist , or Sikh belief , the title retains a hallowed meaning.Guru also refers in Sanskrit to Brihaspati , a Hindu figure analogous to the Roman planet/god Jupiter . In Vedic astrology , Jupiter/Guru/Brihaspati is believed to exert teaching influences . Indeed , in many Indian languages , such as Hindi , the occidental Thursday is called either Brihaspativaar or Guruvaar ( vaar meaning period or day ) .In contemporary India and Indonesia , Guru is widely used within the general meaning of `` teacher '' . In Western usage , the original meaning of guru has been extended to cover anyone who acquires followers , though not necessarily in an established school of philosophy or religion . In a further metaphorical extension , guru is used to refer to a person who has authority because of his or her perceived knowledge or skills in a domain of expertise.The importance of discerning between a true guru and a false one is explored in scriptures and teachings of religions in which a guru plays a role . The assessment and criticism of gurus and the Guru-shishya tradition are espoused in the discourse about cults and new religious movements by Western secular scholars , theologians , anti-cultists and by skeptics both in the West and in India .",0

We ca n't control the weather and bend it to our will so now they want us to believe that we can drastically alter it by ACCIDENT ? ! ? What arrogance ... .

"What can be done to prevent early ejaculation ? Natural Ejaculation Control Technique is a process where breathing techniques are combined with meditative efforts to stop premature ejaculation . How to practice : [ 1 ] Relax and control your breathing - inhaling and exhaling normally . Keep your eyes loosely closed . Put your tongue against the palate . Focus your mind between your eyebrows at the center of your forehead . [ 2 ] Inhale through your nose deeply at intervals of 2-5 seconds until you can feel your abdomen expand , maximizing the capacity of your lungs . Now , focus your mind to the center of your body , directly towards your navel . [ 3 ] Hold your breath and move your expanded abdomen downward by contracting your upper abdomen . As pressure gradually builds up against the bladder and the prostate gland , shift your mental focus to the prostate area . * Step 3 is the most important step during intercourse – it requires that you hold your breath for as long as possible while applying pressure to the bladder and prostate area . This will partially block sensitivity to the penis , allowing you to last longer and control ejaculation . [ 4 ] Contract your anus by clenching . Then exhale air slowly out of the mouth , shifting concentration once again towards the center of your forehead . * You should feel hot energy rising from the prostate area along the spinal cord to your head.Repeat this cycle several times . But remember , when using the anal clenching method during intercourse , your inhalations and contractions of the abdomen should coincide with your sexual thrusting motions.Although , this might seem difficult at first , with just a little practice ( alone or with a partner ) , you ’ ll soon master it .",0

"Though electron affinity of fluorine is greater than flourine , Flourine acts as a better oxidising agent.Why ? I am assuming you are talking about fluorine and chlorine . But electron affinity deals only with the atoms ability to accept an electron . Oxidation deals with interactions between atoms . Fluorine being smaller has more atoms that are close to the atom being oxidized and thus greater charge density around the atom it 's oxidizing . Electron affinity deals only with electrons and no atoms thus electron repulsion of the smaller fluorine orbitals cause a decrease in electron affinity when compared to the larger atom of chlorine . I am not sure this is correct but it is all I could think of . Good luck .",0

"Are serial killers psychopaths ? generally yes . however only 2 % of people with mental illnesses are violent.. stop watching all those stupid hollywood movies..also psychopath is not an appropriate word.. psychosis is a symptom.. not an illness ... a personality disorder such as anti-social generally are the more appropriate diagnosis..note to question asker.. dr. dee doesnt have the slightest fricking clue what he is talking about.. geez.. quite frankly id call his post a textbook example of `` projection '' .. if you want to learn something about psychology.. see what he says if he returns and reads this paragraph.. ; ) as to your hypothetical.. many serial killers prior to being caught were very well known and liked members of society.. chances are if you knew a serial killer you would have no idea he was in fact one ... ted bundy for example was a very charming gentleman.. nobody would have guessed. > > As to bipolar.. aka manic-depressive.. some are known to be violent at times , when they are , it is impulsive . For example ... If a person with bipolar attacks or kills somebody its not well planned and would be obvious to authorties who was responsible for it . Because of the nature of bipolar disorder ... the person would eventually `` come back to reality '' . Now as to psychopaths who are `` serial killers '' ... by the time somebody had claimed enough victems to be labeled as such , would be experienced and `` rational '' enough to know not to behave in a way which would indicate their guilt for murder or any other crime . Many people who have a tendancy towards psychosis are very intelligent people , ironically.lizzie borden is an example of `` impulsive '' .. as I already mentioned.. she killed her parents with an axe.. she wasnt a serial killer.. and from my understanding of the story.. they probably deserved it..by the way.. Ms. Borden was found `` not guilty '' of those murders ... does it mean she was innocent ? .. probably not ( think O.J. ) .. but legally she was ...",0

If you have n't `` personalized '' either , then you can delete both partitions and start from scratch.Or , maybe , you could delete the D : installation , and if you are unable to get the one on C : to work , you could do the type of installation that does n't overwrite files you have added to it.Or you could format C : .

"Are kids these days irresponsible ? I live with two roommates and have to ask them for the rent at the end of EVERY MONTH . I would think that they would be responsible enough to remember and that I would n't have to remind them . And the fact that I have to keep asking them stresses me out . But my friends tell me that they usually have to ask their roommates as well for the money . Am I stressing about this for no reason or are kids these days becoming more irresponsible ? You could argue , it 's not directly the kids , rather the influence of many factors upon them.Some would be : Less restrictive upbringing . The trend these days seems to be to let kids do whatever they want with very little or no punishment , this is hopeless for instilling responsibility.Information age .

The Last Farewell ( English version of Mi Ultimo Adios ) by Jose RizalFarewell , my adored Land , region of the sun caressed , Pearl of the Orient Sea , our Eden lost , With gladness I give you my Life , sad and repressed ; And were it more brilliant , more fresh and at its best , I would still give it to you for your welfare at most.On the fields of battle , in the fury of fight , Others give you their lives without pain or hesitancy , The place does not matter : cypress laurel , lily white , Scaffold , open field , conflict or martyrdom 's site , It is the same if asked by home and Country.I die as I see tints on the sky b'gin to showAnd at last announce the day , after a gloomy night ; If you need a hue to dye your matutinal glow , Pour my blood and at the right moment spread it so , And gild it with a reflection of your nascent light ! My dreams , when scarcely a lad adolescent , My dreams when already a youth , full of vigor to attain , Were to see you , gem of the sea of the Orient , Your dark eyes dry , smooth brow held to a high planeWithout frown , without wrinkles and of shame without stain.My life 's fancy , my ardent , passionate desire , Hail ! Cries out the soul to you , that will soon part from thee ; Hail ! How sweet 't is to fall that fullness you may acquire ; To die to give you life , 'neath your skies to expire , And in your mystic land to sleep through eternity ! If over my tomb some day , you would see blow , A simple humble flow'r amidst thick grasses , Bring it up to your lips and kiss my soul so , And under the cold tomb , I may feel on my brow , Warmth of your breath , a whiff of your tenderness.Let the moon with soft , gentle light me descry , Let the dawn send forth its fleeting , brilliant light , In murmurs grave allow the wind to sigh , And should a bird descend on my cross and alight , Let the bird intone a song of peace o'er my site.Let the burning sun the raindrops vaporizeAnd with my clamor behind return pure to the sky ; Let a friend shed tears over my early demise ; And on quiet afternoons when one prays for me on high , Pray too , oh , my Motherland , that in God may rest I.Pray thee for all the hapless who have died , For all those who unequalled torments have undergone ; For our poor mothers who in bitterness have cried ; For orphans , widows and captives to tortures were shied , And pray too that you may see your own redemption.And when the dark night wraps the cemet'ryAnd only the dead to vigil there are left alone , Do n't disturb their repose , do n't disturb the mystery : If you hear the sounds of cittern or psaltery , It is I , dear Country , who , a song t'you intone.And when my grave by all is no more remembered , With neither cross nor stone to mark its place , Let it be plowed by man , with spade let it be scatteredAnd my ashes ere to nothingness are restored , Let them turn to dust to cover your earthly space.Then it does n't matter that you should forget me : Your atmosphere , your skies , your vales I 'll sweep ; Vibrant and clear note to your ears I shall be : Aroma , light , hues , murmur , song , moanings deep , Constantly repeating the essence of the faith I keep.My idolized Country , for whom I most gravely pine , Dear Philippines , to my last goodbye , oh , harkenThere I leave all : my parents , loves of mine , I 'll go where there are no slaves , tyrants or hangmenWhere faith does not kill and where God alone does reign.Farewell , parents , brothers , beloved by me , Friends of my childhood , in the home distressed ; Give thanks that now I rest from the wearisome day ; Farewell , sweet stranger , my friend , who brightened my way ; Farewell , to all I love . To die is to rest .",0

"whats happens with egg pressure and how much can it take how do i messure it ? mike ? how do i messure egg pressure how can u make it so that u can make the question a science fair topic The pressure within a chicken egg may be rather nominal , because eggs breathe without lungs . Oxygen is free to diffuse through the shell . Water is nearly incompressible , the effect even seven miles down at the bottom of the sea is nil . Gas is highly compressible and you have to halve the volume to double the pressure at constant temperature , per the perfect gas laws.Most boiled eggs are not perfectly ovalic because there is an air space within the shell . That air space would resist any increase in `` hydraulic '' pressure and excess gas should diffuse out of the shell.Of course a spoiled egg may build up pressure due to rapid decomposition and an egg shell would be fairly strong to retain it . Never microwave eggs because they may build up steam pressure and make a real mess . Early microwave machines had perforated plastic doors rather than solid glass and I recall one unhappy fellow who received a polkadot egg spattered shirt . Good luck .",0

The installation tech for the cable modem said I had such a good connection with the wireless system that in my small development , other wireless cards might accidentally link with my network . How do I prevent this ? Use WPA instead of WEP if your router is older and does n't have wpa then use WEP . Secondly , of course change the password on the router itself . Next , change the default ssid and change it so that the ssid is not broadcast . Finally , set it up so that only certain MAC address are able to access the network ( yourself included : ) ) . You really should do all these things to make your home network secure , you really should n't pick and choose .",0

"how can you become a professional boxer and thats the latest age to start boxing i am 24 years old ? Rocky Marciano did n't start boxing until he was 22 and he is considered one of the all-time-greats . However , at this age you 'll have to really dedicate yourself to training . Try to find a good local gym with a trainer who has experience with pro fighters . You 'll still probably have to try out the amateur circuit , but you 've got time . Although most boxing experts agree that boxers do n't have enough to be at the top anymore at 35 , that 's still a long time away , and you 've seen what George Foreman was able to do . If you 're willing to do your roadwork every morning and do whatever your trainer says , I 'm sure you can do well .",0
"What are eyebrows for ? from straigtdope.com : '' The consensus is that eyebrows keep moisture ( sweat , mostly , but also rain ) from running down one 's forehead and straight into the eyes . This explanation has the advantage of being quite easily demonstrated , fitting the morphology involved ( notice the distinct slant of the brow hairs , which conducts water sideways ) , and having a logical survival advantage . There have been one or two comments from people who were , for one reason or another , temporarily without eyebrows who claimed the difference was noticeable . I 've always been content with that explanation . It may not have much impact on a modern human 's life , but next time you 're hunting ( or being hunted ) on the African savanna , try shaving off your eyebrows and see if salty sweat running in your eyes makes the task any more difficult . I 'll bet it does . ''",0

"whats the most effective treatment to kill lice eggs ? killing the bugs has n't been the problem those eggs are.I just want her hair pretty and shiney again and for this problem gone for good .I know to wash everything and to spray bedding and furniture.Thanks The problem is that you ca n't kill the eggs . The nits are encased in a very strong type substance that can not be penetrated . The most important thing is to retreat the hair after 7 to 10 days and you HAVE to get all the nits out by hand or by comb . I find those plastic combs ineffective . I ordered a metal comb called medi comb from a dealer on ebay . It works the best but you will still need to hand pick some . They are such a pain ! Also using hair styling products ( after hair is nit/lice free ) daily helps prevent reinfestation from contant with others ( at school/bus/etc. ) . I also flat iron/or hot iron curl her hair at times or braid it . Anything that keeps it back or helps to kill those pests ! Also watch closely the friends they play with and if you see any kind of scratching check the child immediately and send them home to tell their parents if you find any nits or anything . Check over the ears and nape of the neck . Also they do make lice repellent spray that you can order ( search online ) it 's mostly tea tree oil , eucalyptus , geranium , and other essential oils mixed with water but it could help if your child is in close proximity of other children and lice is a reoccurring problem . Prevention is the best medicine .",0

"How often should you get your well water tested ? We tested it over 8 years ago and it had some pesky little buggers in it so we ca n't drink it . The pump went bad and we fixed it and added clorox to the well like your supposed to . Do the organisms change over time ? Whether the organisms change over time depends on the origin of the microorganisms . If the contamination resulted from surface water intruding into the well , the conditions may have changed.Since you suspected the well water to cause allergic reactions , I 'd advise you have it tested on microorganisms again . The chlorox was added to the water after the pump , or to the bottom ? The intervals of microbiological testing depend on the amount of water you draw and the use you put the water to . If it gets into contact with food or cutlery , I 'd advise intervals of 3 to 5 years . If the chlorox treatment has rendered it drinkable , regular repeats are necessary , also in order to manage the dosage .",0

"what do you do yourself to cut down your appetite ? The basics of most nutrition booksDon ’ t starve yourself . That ’ s the worst thing you can do in a diet because it slows down your metabolism and your body starts getting more fat from your food intake since , fat is the bodies fastest and easiest type of nutrition [ not the healthiest though ] . The reason this happen is because this helped us when we were no doing so good as hunters and gathers to keep us alive a bit longer . Before I continue let me explain protein , carbohydrates , and fats.Protein is easiest described as anything that comes from or was an animal such chicken , fish , sirloin , and milk . Carbohydrates [ carbs ] can be found almost in anything else even apples.Good carbs : Apples , wheat bread , sourdough bread , grains , and wheat Bad carbs : White bread , hamburger buns , hotdog buns , Doritos , and sodas ! Good fats : Avocados , pecans , almonds , and peanut butter The ratio in your diet varies but I think a good starting point is something like [ 50 % Protien:40 % Carbs:10 % fat ] This can sound meaningless . So in plain terms consume only good fats [ portioned ] and you should be okay . Something like a handful of almonds , or a table spoon of peanut butter should be consumed three times a day [ separately . not consecutively ] . The reason this is relevant to your question of decreasing your appetite is because you are required to intake around 1200 calories for a 180lb person [ Proteins are 4 calories , Carbs are 4 calories , Fats are 9 calories ] so theoretically if you eat less fats and more proteins you will have a less appetite because you will eat more . Another nifty advice is that your body turns carbohydrates into fat not fat itself . That ’ s how the Adkins basically works . If you consume more proteins and less carbs you will lose weight . I leave to you to decide if this is good you.I would also advice you to split up your day into 5 meals . [ warning : it will feel weird because you are not used to eating this decreased amount . Just keep in mind that you will eat in 3 hour and you will quickly noticed that you will not go hungry and most importantly not feel hungry ] if you do feel hungry eat a small snack like an apple or a wrap of peanut butter with a wheat tortilla.You are suppose to split up meals because your body can consume a certain amount of nutrition the rest is just wasted and turned into fat [ if you have been starving yourself or if you don ’ t exercise ] .",0

I think the opposite , some of the special effect sequences ( which were great ) could be removed .

"is there difference between laptop desinged for WinXP home and WinXP professional ? Can i switch to Pro . later ? Yes to both questions . The XP home designated machine might have extra features such as a brightly colored 'launch email ' button to make XP more accessible to non power users , as opposed to XP pro machines that might feature an extra data port instead that more experienced users might find more useful .

"what do these college sports phrases mean ? 1 ) true freshman 2 ) fifth year senior 3 ) walk on 4 ) red shirt . Thanks The NCAA rules allow a player 5 years to complete his/her 4 years of eligibility.A true freshman is someone playing during the first year of eligibility.A fifth year senior is someone who sat out a year ( see red shirt ) and is completing the 4th year of eligibility during his/her 5th year in school.A walkon is someone who was not recruted and given a scholarship . The athlete just showed up , tried out , and was good enough to stay on the team.A red shirt is an athlete who is passing up a year of play to extend eligibility . Red shirted players are allowed to practice with the team but not take part in competition.Originally , red shirting was allowed if an athlete was injured severly enough to end his season . The team could petition the NCAA for an extra year of eligibilty , and the player was red shirted for the remainder of the year.The name comes from the practice of having injured football players wear a red practice jersey to protect him during practice . Today redshirting may be done to allow a player to gain an extra year of experience before playing in `` The Big Time '' . It also may be done as a personel management tool . If a coach has two equally good players competing for one position as quarterback , one may be redshirted . That way his eligability is n't used up sitting on the bench .",0

"Which search engine is better and brighter ? My vote goes to Google.My answer is google for the following reasons : Pros of Google : As a seach engine , google has the best relevance and presents the results in a way that I find easy to decide what pages are best for me . Its the best in terms of researching information.For makin money , a # 1 on google is worth many times more than a # 1 on yahoo . Yahoo ! blocks the top of the SERPs with sponsored ads.Google also has a neat interface . Yahoo is not bad too , but its interface is not that neat . The reason for that being it to be a portal . I think a nice interface is very important since people will come back more often if so.The relevance of search results make its 'Feeling Lucky ' feature pretty useful . Firefox address bar by defaults goes to 1 site listed on your search results.Google has tried to stay away from Spam/ misleading sites better than other search engines.Cons of Google : However , few problems with google , its web crawler dose n't capture hyperlinks from PDF files stored on net , a feature which Yahoo provides.Also , Google at present does not provide an index for video aggregation through the web crawler , a feature which Altavista provided since 1999 . The problems include accuracy of the media file . That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.Due to a larger share of 'searching ' community , Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs .

"Does the sun really set when we see it disappear in the horizon or before ? My question is about optics . The short answer is : Yes.I think the previous people who attempted to answer this question did not read it carefully . The atmosphere is in layers , of different densities , that refract the sunlight and different colors different amounts . The light is bent downwards because the speed of light in the upper layers is greater than the speed of light in the layers closer to the ground . One can see this effect in the change in shape of the sun as it sets , and the effects like disconnected pieces of sun , green flashes , etc . This is just the same as the effect that creates mirages , or the spurious images of water on or above dry roads in the heat . So it is definitely true , that the sun has already gone below the horizon , when we still view its image .",0

"What is the bladder 's job ? In the anatomy of mammals , the urinary bladder is the organ that collects urine excreted by the kidneys prior to disposal by urination . Urine enters the bladder via the ureters and exits via the urethra. -- -- -- -- -AnatomyThe urinary bladder is a hollow , muscular and distensible organ that sits on the pelvic floor ( superior to the prostate in males ) . On its anterior border lies the pubic symphysis and , on its posterior border , the vagina ( in females ) and rectum ( in males ) . The urinary bladder is normally capable of storing 1.1-1.3 liters of urine , but because it is made up of transitional epithelium it is able to stretch to volumes of even several litres.The ureters enter the bladder diagonally from its dorsolateral floor in an area called the trigone .

"'NASTERDAM ' who is this man ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Born in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in the south of France in December 1503 , Michel de Nostredame was the son of a grain dealer who was also a prosperous home-grown notary . His family was originally Jewish , but had converted to Catholicism during the previous century along with thousands of others , due to increasing official French persecution of Jews , many of whom were the descendants of former refugees from Spain , where they were known as the Marranos . The names of Nostredame 's known forebears seem to reflect this . While practice of the ancestral religion was often apparently continued in secret , nobody knows whether this applied to Nostredame 's family , or whether it still applied to him two generations later . ( It should be noted that the majority of Jews at the time frowned upon such 'cover conversions ' , not least because succeeding generations of offspring were inevitably more at risk to lose connection with their past , and thus with their roots and religion . ) His adult religious leanings suggest , however , that his upbringing was devoutly Catholic.This apart , nothing is known about his childhood , but at the age of fifteen he entered the University of Avignon to study for his baccalaureate . After little more than a year he was forced by the plague to leave again . In 1529 , after some years as an apothecary , he entered the University of Montpellier to study for a doctorate in medicine , but was promptly expelled again when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary , which was a 'manual ' trade expressly banned by the university statutes . He then continued work as an apothecary ( though some of his publishers and correspondents would later call him 'Doctor ' ) , and created a `` rose pill '' that was widely believed to protect against the the plague.In 1531 he was invited by Jules-César Scaliger , a leading Renaissance man , to come to Agen . There Nostradamus married a woman whose name is still in dispute ( possibly Henriette d'Encausse ) , but who bore him two children . In 1534 , however , his wife and children died , presumably from the plague . After their death he continued to travel , passing through France and possibly Italy.He settled down in 1547 in Salon-de-Provence , where he married a rich widow named Anne Ponsarde Gemelle and eventually had six children – three daughters and three sons . After a further visit to Italy , he began to move away from medicine and towards the occult . He wrote an almanac for 1550 , for the first time Latinising his name to 'Nostradamus ' , and was so encouraged by its success that he decided to write one or more annually . Taken together , they are known to have contained at least 6338 prophecies ( most of them , in the event , failed predictions – see Chevignard and Lemesurier ( 2 ) under Sources ) , as well as at least 11 annual calendars , all of them starting on 1st January and not , as is sometimes supposed , in March . He then began his project of writing 1,000 quatrains , which form the supposed prophecies for which he is famous today . Feeling vulnerable to religious fanatics , however , he devised a method of obscuring his meaning by using `` Virgilianised '' syntax , word games and a mixture of languages such as Provençal , Greek , Latin and Italian . For technical reasons connected with their publication in three instalments , the last 58 quatrains of the seventh 'Century ' , or book of 100 verses , did not survive into any extant edition.The quatrains , written in a book titled `` Les Propheties '' , received a mixed reaction when they were published . Some people thought Nostradamus was a servant of evil , a fake , or insane , while many of the elite thought his quatrains were spiritually inspired prophecies . Soon nobility were coming from far and wide to receive horoscopes and advice from him , though he normally expected them to supply the birthcharts on which they were based .

"i want to know everything about GENETICS. ? Genetics , scientific study of how physical , biochemical , and behavioural traits are transmitted from parents to their offspring . The word itself was coined in 1906 by the British biologist William Bateson . Geneticists determine the mechanisms of inheritance whereby the offspring of sexually reproducing organisms do not exactly resemble their parents , and the differences and similarities between parents and offspring recur from generation to generation in repeated patterns . The investigation of these patterns has led to some of the most exciting discoveries in modern biology.Soon after Mendel 's work was rediscovered , scientists realized that the patterns of inheritance he had described paralleled the action of chromosomes in dividing cells , and they proposed that the Mendelian units of inheritance , the genes , are carried by the chromosomes . This led to intensive studies of cell division.Every cell comes from the division of a pre-existing cell . All the cells that make up a human being , for example , are derived from the successive divisions of a single cell , the zygote ( see Fertilization ) , which is formed by the union of an egg and a sperm . The great majority of the cells produced by the division of the zygote are , in the composition of their hereditary material , identical to one another and to the zygote itself ( assuming that no mutations occur ; see below ) . Each cell of a higher organism is composed of a jellylike layer of material , the cytoplasm , which contains many small structures . This cytoplasmic material surrounds a prominent body called the nucleus . Every nucleus contains a number of minute , threadlike chromosomes . Some relatively simple organisms , such as cyanobacteria and bacteria , have no distinct nucleus but do have cytoplasm , which contains one or more chromosomes.Chromosomes vary in size and shape and usually occur in pairs . The members of each pair , called homologues , closely resemble each other . Most cells in the human body contain 23 pairs of chromosomes , whereas most cells of the fruit fly Drosophila contain four pairs , and the bacterium Escherichia coli has a single chromosome in the form of a ring . Every chromosome in a cell is now known to contain many genes , and each gene is located at a particular site , or locus , on the chromosome.The process of cell division by which a new cell comes to have an identical number of chromosomes as the parent cell is called mitosis ( see Reproduction ) . In mitotic division each chromosome divides into two equal parts , and the two parts travel to opposite ends of the cell . After the cell divides , each of the two resulting cells has the same number of chromosomes and genes as the original cell ( see Cell : Division , Reproduction , and Differentiation ) . Every cell formed in this process thus has the same genetic material . Simple one-celled organisms and some multicellular forms reproduce by mitosis ; it is also the process by which complex organisms achieve growth and replace worn-out tissue.Higher organisms that reproduce sexually are formed from the union of two special sex cells known as gametes . Gametes are produced by meiosis , the process by which germ cells divide . It differs from mitosis in one important way : in meiosis a single chromosome from each pair of chromosomes is transmitted from the original cell to each of the new cells . Thus , each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes that are found in the other body cells . When two gametes unite in fertilization , the resulting cell , called the zygote , contains the full , double set of chromosomes . Half of these chromosomes normally come from one parent and half from the other.For more than 50 years after the science of genetics was established and the patterns of inheritance through genes were clarified , the largest questions remained unanswered : how are the chromosomes and their genes copied from cell to cell , and how do they direct the structure and behaviour of living things ?

"If a woodchuck were to actually chuck wood , what is the quantity of the wood that would be chucked ? I despise those who do n't take your question seriously . I bit my thumb at them .

It stems from an Algonquian name for the animal ( possibly Narraganset ) , wuchak .

"what are the differences between the processes of fission and fusion ? The main difference that there is between fission and fusion is that fission is the splitting of an atom to form two smaller ones while fusion is the fusing of two smaller atoms to form a larger atom . In each of these the binding energy of the final product or products is higher than that of the prerequisites . This is explained more fully in the next section ( Binding Energy ) .Fission itself is a nuclear process which does not usually occur naturally in nature ( at least not that we know of ) as it requires a large mass and an incident neutron to start the reaction . However this would not last for a long time as the reaction would explode and produce a result such as in an atomic bomb . This volatile nature is what prevents fission from occurring for any length of time naturally.Fusion on the other hand is a process which occurs quite naturally . In fact , if fusion did not occur naturally we would not be around today . This is due to stars being the result of the fusion process , the fusion of mainly light atoms into heavier atoms . Fusion also releases a lot more energy in comparison to fission in relation to the mass input . Put simply you will get more energy released from the fusion of 1kg of hydrogen ions than you will from fission of 1kg of Uranium .",0

It defines seven network layers . Layer 1 - Physical Physical layer defines the cable or physical medium itself , e.g. , thinnet , thicknet , unshielded twisted pairs ( UTP ) . All media are functionally equivalent . The main difference is in convenience and cost of installation and maintenance . Converters from one media to another operate at this level . Layer 2 - Data Link Data Link layer defines the format of data on the network . A network data frame , aka packet , includes checksum , source and destination address , and data . The largest packet that can be sent through a data link layer defines the Maximum Transmission Unit ( MTU ) . The data link layer handles the physical and logical connections to the packet 's destination , using a network interface . A host connected to an Ethernet would have an Ethernet interface to handle connections to the outside world , and a loopback interface to send packets to itself . Ethernet addresses a host using a unique , 48-bit address called its Ethernet address or Media Access Control ( MAC ) address . MAC addresses are usually represented as six colon-separated pairs of hex digits , e.g. , 8:0:20:11 : ac:85 . This number is unique and is associated with a particular Ethernet device . Hosts with multiple network interfaces should use the same MAC address on each . The data link layer 's protocol-specific header specifies the MAC address of the packet 's source and destination . When a packet is sent to all hosts ( broadcast ) , a special MAC address ( ff : ff : ff : ff : ff : ff ) is used . Layer 3 - Network NFS uses Internetwork Protocol ( IP ) as its network layer interface . IP is responsible for routing , directing datagrams from one network to another . The network layer may have to break large datagrams , larger than MTU , into smaller packets and host receiving the packet will have to reassemble the fragmented datagram . The Internetwork Protocol identifies each host with a 32-bit IP address . IP addresses are written as four dot-separated decimal numbers between 0 and 255 , e.g. , 129.79.16.40 . The leading 1-3 bytes of the IP identify the network and the remaining bytes identifies the host on that network . The network portion of the IP is assigned by InterNIC Registration Services , under the contract to the National Science Foundation , and the host portion of the IP is assigned by the local network administrators , locally by noc @ indiana.edu . For large sites , usually subnetted like ours , the first two bytes represents the network portion of the IP , and the third and fourth bytes identify the subnet and host respectively . Even though IP packets are addressed using IP addresses , hardware addresses must be used to actually transport data from one host to another . The Address Resolution Protocol ( ARP ) is used to map the IP address to it hardware address . Layer 4 - Transport Transport layer subdivides user-buffer into network-buffer sized datagrams and enforces desired transmission control . Two transport protocols , Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) and User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) , sits at the transport layer . Reliability and speed are the primary difference between these two protocols . TCP establishes connections between two hosts on the network through 'sockets ' which are determined by the IP address and port number . TCP keeps track of the packet delivery order and the packets that must be resent . Maintaining this information for each connection makes TCP a stateful protocol . UDP on the other hand provides a low overhead transmission service , but with less error checking . NFS is built on top of UDP because of its speed and statelessness . Statelessness simplifies the crash",0

"Preparing a Solution ? How many grams of CaCl2 are needed to prepare 147.5 mL of a 1.270 M solution ? Please explain your answer so I can learn : D. Thanks ! 1 mole ( also represented as mol ) = 6.022x10^23 . This is just a number . Molecules are represented in mol quantities because they 're too small to work with otherwise . So that when you are dealing with CaCl2 in these problems , you 're actually using 6.022x10^23 molecules of CaCl2 . Additionally , when you see the molecular weight of a molecule , that is actually the weight of 1mol of that molecule.1M= 1mol/Litre . You need 1.27M . Divide 1.27 by 1,000 to find the number of mol CaCl2 per mL you need . ( 1.27/1,000=0.00127mol CaCl2/mL ) Multiply this by 147.5 to get the number of mol CaCl2 you will have . ( 0.00127*147.5= 0.187325mol CaCl2 ) Now multiply this number by the molecular weight of CaCl2 to get your answer ! ( 0.187325*110.984= 20.79g CaCl2 )",0

"why do hen lay eggs ? Chicken eggs are the most commonly eaten egg . They are highly nutritious . Eggs are high in complete protein and provide significant amounts of several vitamins and minerals ( Vitamin A , Riboflavin , Folic Acid , Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12 , and Iron ) . Eggs are among the cheapest single-food source of complete protein available , which is essential to health and well being.The shape of an egg is approximately an oblate ellipsoid , but , while keeping cylindrical symmetry , there is typically not quite symmetry in a plane perpendicular to the long axis . See also oval ( geometry ) .Shell colorDifferent breeds of chicken can lay eggs with shells varying from whites through to brown and rarer colours such as speckled green . Although there are absolutely no nutritional differences , there is often a cultural preference for one colour over another . For example , in most regions of the United States eggs are generally white , while in the northeast of that country , and in the United Kingdom eggs are generally light-brown . These habits may be associated with perceptions of greater purity in white-shelled eggs or greater wholesomeness in brown-shelled eggs",0

"How long is the average penis ? What is the length of the longest docuemnted penis ? Your penis is like an artist ’ s paintbrush . It ’ s not how long it is that matters .

What ’ s far more important is whether you ’ re skilled at using your penis to satisfy your woman . Can you last as long as you want ? Can you vary the depth of your strokes , the pace of them , the angle of them , so that you can offer your woman a little teasing and unpredictability at times ? Are you skilled enough at other ways to pleasure her , so that penis-vagina intercourse is only one of the things on the menu you offer her ? Even if you can ’ t do all of these things at present , these are all things you can LEARN to do .

Even in dark , cool conditions , fluorine reacts explosively with hydrogen . - > It is so reactive that glass , metals , and even water , as well as other substances , burn with a bright flame in a jet of fluorine gas . - > It is far too reactive to be found in elemental form and has such an affinity for most elements , including silicon , that it can neither be prepared nor should be kept in glass vessels . In moist air it reacts with water to form the equally dangerous hydrofluoric acid.- > In aqueous solution , fluorine commonly occurs as the fluoride ion F- .

"A force of 12N is applied to the handle of a screw driver being used to pry the lid off a paint can.. ? As the force moves through a distance of 0.3m , the screwdriver does 3.2 J of work on the lid . What is the EFFICIENCY of the screwdriver ? How did you figure that out.. i cant not figure it out so if anyone can and explain how they did it that would be great . Thanks . ok , all you have to do is figure out how much work it should have been doing , then compare it to the amount of work it actually did by using a percentage . so first of all , W=Fx ( work equals Force times distance ) that means that W= ( 12 ) ( .3 ) =3.6 J of work . Ok , so since it only did 3.2 J , that means .4J were lost somewhere . the efficiency is calculating the efficiency in terms of what percentage of the work that was actually applied was translated into the work energy that was done on the lid . the way you do this is just divide the amount of work it did by the amount of work it should have done ( in an ideal solution ) and then multiply by 100 in order to find the percentage of work it actually did in relation to the work it should have done . 3.2/3.6= .88889 ( x 100 ) = 88.89 % . so basically , in cases with efficiency , you divide the number you solved for by the number they gave you . a good way to figure out which you divide by which is just to randomly try dividing and if the answer is above 1 ( 100 % ) , that 's impossible so you switch them ; )",0

"Why do women hate prenupts so much ? Marriage is about love , not finances . Prenps spell out terms that a divorce court would otherwise decide . Whe wealthier person usually requests a prenup of the less wealthy person before marriage , so usually the man requests of the woman . The prenup is usually drawn up by the lawyers of the wealther person and it tends to favor that person 's interests.The only reason the wealthier person would want a prenup is because they fear that they have more to lose in a divorce if they go through the court system , or they feel that they have a better negotiating position before the marriage starts than after it ends.This means that pretty much all the time the less wealthy person would fare better in divorce court then they would with a prenup.There are exceptions to this , such as wanting to protect some family heirloom or property that has been in someone 's family for hundreds of years or when the prenup is equally negotiated and each person has a thoroughly competent attorney with their interests in mind , but most of the time , the woman is asked to and does sign without counsel.I would say that women ( or the less wealthy person ) would object to a prenup for 2 reasons:1 ) They are bothered that the husband , his family , or his lawyers/staff are already thinking about divorce right before the marriage.2 ) They are upset that the husband wants to put the wife in a less favorable legal position should a divorce happen .",0

"Help ! ! Anyone ? I have spoken to a few people from India they all told me they do not lie does this has to do with there culture , religion or both ? I was afraid to ask them because I felt they will feel like they were lying . ( not joking ) I 'm afraid they are lying . Everyone does it , and in India , its pervasive . My uncle spent a few years `` soul searching '' as a hippie in India in the 60 's and 70 's , ( no joke ! ) and and I know an Indian pastor . He says its common when sifting grain for the sifters to grab tiny pebbles out of the flying flour ( that was placed in it to increase its density , and therefore its price ) Just be careful and take things with a grain of salt . And get treated for intestinal aemebas after you drink with the merchants . But do drink , with them , it is insulting not to .",0

"Anime and Manga ? What is ur thoughts about Japanesse manga and anime ... Which one do u like best . `` Pokémon is a Anime . '' Well I happen to enjoy both Anime and Manga , though I 've only recently gotten into manga . Personally , my favorite is Ruroni Kenshin , I like the story , the serioussness mixed with comedy , and the overall sadness of the story . My second favorite would have to be Scryed , a fairly new anime . Personally , though , there are very few animes that I do n't like . Cowboy Bebop , Wolf 's Rain , Samurai Champloo , Full Metal Alchemist , Full Metal Panic , Inuyasha , Big O , Soul Hunter , Dragon Ball Z , Gundam ... .all of these are great anime 's and I enjoy each of them . I mainly get my anime from Cartoon Network but I do own a few that are not on Adult Swim . I 've always liked the range of emotions that run throughout most anime , and the over the top action is great as well . There is alot that I enjoy about anime , most of which ca n't be summed up into words : D. The only ones I hate are : Pokemon , Digimon , Yugi-oh , and Reign . I 'm sure there are more but those are the only ones I can remember . Anyway , anime is great , those are my thoughts .",0

His short answer was reportedly `` No number , no airline , my plane . '' Customs then asked for the registration number of his plane which he did n't have . He then told customs officials that he had five planes , and he just phoned for one of them to come pick him .

"Is Intel Better or AMD ? Can anyone tell me whether AMD computers are better or the Intel ones . I was told by somebody that even AMD Sempron does not require any additional graphic card and could play any type of game however high graphics the game may have . The graphics built into the motherboard is what controls the graphics , not the cpu . Having a fast processor helps , but to play games like half life 2 you would probably still need to buy a separate graphics card . Your computer is only as fast as the weakest link so do n't overspend in one area ( cpu ) and leave another too slow ( memory or graphics ) . For processor speed comparisons check out the link .

"Some people say God is dead ? Who are they ? Are they right ? If God is dead then we should all be gone right now ! Those who said God is dead are ignorant of the Bible or least we say , ungrateful and unappreciative to the many wonderful blessings and miracles God showered upon us whether we love or hate Him . That is God 's justice to mankind . He will let good people do good and the wicked do wickedness if they want because this way , God will be able to determine if His judgment is justified . He does not force anyone to believe Him nor He is a dictator . You can be whoever you want to be . And to the last question if these people are right . Definitely no . For believing that God is dead they are really putting shame on their faces . What made you believe there is no God or God is dead ?

"is yahoo better or google ? My answer is google for the following reasons : Pros of Google : As a seach engine , google has the best relevance and presents the results in a way that I find easy to decide what pages are best for me . Its the best in terms of researching information.For makin money , a # 1 on google is worth many times more than a # 1 on yahoo . Yahoo ! blocks the top of the SERPs with sponsored ads.Google also has a neat interface . Yahoo is not bad too , but its interface is not that neat . The reason for that being it to be a portal . I think a nice interface is very important since people will come back more often if so.The relevance of search results make its 'Feeling Lucky ' feature pretty useful . Firefox address bar by defaults goes to 1 site listed on your search results.Google has tried to stay away from Spam/ misleading sites better than other search engines.Cons of Google : However , few problems with google , its web crawler dose n't capture hyperlinks from PDF files stored on net , a feature which Yahoo provides.Also , Google at present does not provide an index for video aggregation through the web crawler , a feature which Altavista provided since 1999 . The problems include accuracy of the media file . That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.Due to a larger share of 'searching ' community , Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs . Because most bloggers mention the word failure with President Bush 's name , the # 1 site on searching Failure is the website of President Bush.Yahoo is doing pretty good research in Search Technologies , for example Grokker.http : //www.grokker.com/grokker.html ? query=Anirudh % 20Koul & Yahoo=true & Daypop=true & numResults=250",0

"how many merders happen in new york each year ? 270 during last year.Murders were up slightly nationwide during the first six months of the year , and gang violence contributed to more killings in some of the nation 's largest cities , the FBI reported Monday . The number of murders rose 1.1 % nationwide , while overall violent crime declined 3.1 % . New York , Baltimore and Philadelphia were among the cities with an increase in homicides.The reasons for the increase in homicides vary by city . But experts said there has been a resurgence in gang activity in some of the cities . `` The question is , what are they fighting over ? '' said Kenneth Land , a Duke University sociology professor . `` Is it retribution homicides , or turf wars over drugs , or is it protecting turf ? `` The FBI 's six-month status report , based on reports from state and local law enforcement agencies , is widely viewed as an important indicator of national crime trends each year . The report also is considered a good predictor for the bureau 's year-end crime analysis.The report does not include raw totals for categories of crimes , only percentages . However , the FBI had figures for some large cities.The six-month totals for 2003 marked the third consecutive time the FBI has recorded a decrease in overall violent crimes but an increase in murders.The FBI said there were 308 murders from January to June of this year in New York City , compared with 270 during the same span last year . Philadelphia had 158 murders in the first half of this year — 20 more than in the first half of 2002 . Baltimore had 141 ( 14 more ) and Newark , N.J. , had 40 ( 13 more ) .Officials in Washington declared a crime emergency this summer during a spate of mostly gang-related violence.Overall , there were 4.3 % more murders in the Northeast part of the country during the first half of 2003 compared with last year . There also were slightly more homicides in the South and West ; only the Midwest showed a decrease ( -1.9 % ) .Many major cities outside the Northeast had fewer slayings , the report said . Los Angeles was down by 65 ; it had 258 . Detroit had 156 ( 28 fewer ) and Las Vegas dropped by six , from 70 to 64.Even with the national increase in murder , overall violent crime fell , as it has for most of the past decade . Other violent crimes besides murder that are measured are forcible rape , robbery and aggravated assault.Aggravated assaults were down 4.4 % . Forcible rapes dropped 4 % and robberies less than 1 % . Property crimes dropped by 0.8 % compared with the year before , although motor vehicle thefts were up slightly at 0.9 % . Other property crimes are burglary and larceny.The number of arsons — measured separately — dropped 10 % . Every part of the country saw fewer criminal fires set in the first half of 2003.The nation 's largest cities , those with more than 250,000 residents , saw violent crime drop slightly more than 4 % . The drop was most pronounced in rural areas , however , where violent crime fell 5.7 % . Violent crime was down 1.1 % in the suburbs.The rates for property crime changed very little in cities and suburbs in the first half of 2003 , but rural counties experienced a 2.5 % decrease.All regions of the country showed a decrease in motor vehicle thefts from January to June except the West , where they rose by 7.2 % .The FBI 's Uniform Crime Reports for the first six months of the year are based on information collected from 9,908 state and local law enforcement agencies .",0

"What is a Rife Generator and how does it work ? I 'll post here my answer that I gave when another person asked the same question a month or so ago.The Rife machine is legit depending on what model or manufacturer you got it from . There was a company in the late 80 's to early 90 's called LER that made what they named the REM SuperPro Generator . Though I ca n't vouch for any of the newer models , I can say that Rife 's technology was right on if you can find an original model.YES it shattered cancer cells , YES he was heralded as having found the cure for all diseases , YES he had 100 % success rate on the patients in the Pasadena county hospital . A Rife machine uses scalar waves , along the now established fact that every organism operates at its own distinct frequency . By increasing the resonance , a particular organism can be destroyed without harming the tissue around it . Rife meticulousy recorded the M.O.R . ( mortal oscillatory rate ) for the thousands of micro-organisms he could see under his universal microscope . A properly built Rife frequency generator can not hurt , except for a brief healing crisis , followed by an incredible feeling of health and well-being taken from years of testimonials ( unless you have a pacemaker from what I 've heard ) . A good amount of reading on Rife 's story can be found at some of the links below.Unfortunately most of his work was destroyed because of the newly created AMA and FDA that came into power . They ruled Rife 's work did not fall under their now established guidelines for medical practice , and with the government to back them up , it was the end for his discovery .",0

"What is a triple double and a double double ? A triple double is hard to get - but it can be done .

Might lose the competitive edge because of rework . Leaks always possible.2 ) Weld more permanent and stable in regard to environment and conditions.Does n't need continuous Inspection . Leaks unlikelyHarder to perform change or rework.Regardless , both should recieve Base Line Inspection and Periodic Review.I am assuming you mean strictly Commercial/Industrial Installations .",0

how can you prove that 1+1 is 2 ? prove your answer ? does 1+1=2 is actually a really good question because there is really no way of proving it . Because numbers are abstract ( they are not real ) they represent other things . But if you look at the equation 1+1=2 you will actually see that by itself it makes no sense because one plus one does not equal a two symbol . so without subsituiting the number symbols for actual things the equation is irrational and can not be proven .,0

"Am I a bad friend ? After my Bf and I brokeup , my bestfriend starts dating him behind my back ( I found out a few months after ) . But I let it go .

One in particular was a girl from russia , while in the class I seen her accent decrease dramatically . The reason the class helped her is because before we start our lessons we would do tongue twisters , while keeping our diction ( which means that you have to speak as clearly as possible without dropping off the end of any words or smushing the words together ) . Try some of these tongue twisters : The blue black bug bit the big brown bear , and the big brown bear bled blood.You know New York you need New York , you know you need unique New York.Red leather yellow leather , blue black metal copper kettleChrysanthimum Geranium Alluminum Linoleum-x3Say them as clearly as possible , and find new ones regularly .

It is set in 1944 , in a camp in South Carolina for German prisoners-of-war , overseen by black guards who enjoy few of the liberties the prisoners do . While there , the prisoners are subjected to a secret governmental re-education program which , ironically , resembles Goebbels ' Nazi propaganda . One prisoner escapes , equipped only with the lines he ’ s learned playing the lead in a camp production of Abe Lincoln in Illinois , and chased by a black private who sees the pursuit as a quest for acceptance .

"what is ... ? What is Scienctology ( sp.. sorry ) I just recently heard that term used for a type of religion , I was courious to know if anyone new what it was or what it is about ... thanks Hi , here are a few detailsScientology is a system of beliefs , teachings and rituals , originally established as a secular philosophy in 1952 by science-fiction author L. Ron Hubbard , then recharacterized by him in 1953 as an `` applied religious philosophy . `` Scientology is officially represented by the controversial Church of Scientology . The Church presents itself as a non-profit religious organization dedicated to encouraging development of the human spirit . Providing counseling and rehabilitation programs , the Church offers itself as an alternative to psychiatry , which Scientologists believe to be a barbaric and corrupt profession . [ 1 ] ( http : //www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/heritage/pg011.html ) Church spokespeople attest that Hubbard 's teaching ( called `` technology '' or `` tech '' ) has freed them from drug and alcohol addictions , depression , learning disabilities , mental disorders and other problems.Scientology , however , has been the object of many allegations that sharply contradict the Church 's self-description . Critics—including officials and the courts of several countries—have characterized the Church of Scientology as an unscrupulous commercial organization ; it has often been described not as a religion , but a man-made cult that harasses its critics and exploits its members . Many of the Church 's most controversial actions are , critics argue , a direct reflection of Hubbard 's Scientology teachings.Origins of ScientologyScientology was expanded and reworked from Dianetics [ 2 ] ( http : //www.neuereligion.de/ENG/Wolf/pg6.htm ) , an earlier system of self-improvement techniques originally set out by Hubbard in the 1950 book , Dianetics : The Modern Science of Mental Health . Immediately prior to this work , Hubbard was intensively involved with the occultist Jack Parsons in performing the occult rites developed by Aleister Crowley . Some critics have seen many similarities in Hubbard 's writings to the doctrines of Crowley [ 3 ] ( http : //www.xenu.net/archive/lrhbare/lrhbare08.html ) .By the mid-1950s , Hubbard had relegated Dianetics to being a sub-study of Scientology , although it is still promoted and delivered by Scientology organizations . The chief difference between the two is that Dianetics is explicitly secular , focused on the individual 's present life and dealing with physical and mental or emotional problems , whereas Scientology adopts a more overtly religious approach [ 4 ] ( http : //victorian.fortunecity.com/finsbury/124/last.htm ) focused on dealing with spiritual issues spanning multiple past lives as well as the present day.Hubbard was repeatedly accused of adopting a religious facade for Scientology in order for the organization to maintain tax-exempt status and avoid prosecution for false medical claims ; these accusations have dogged the Church of Scientology to the present day , bolstered by numerous accounts from Hubbard 's fellow science-fiction authors that on various occasions he stated that the way to get rich was to start a religion [ 5 ] ( http : //www.bible.ca/scientology-1million-start-a-religion.htm ) .The word scientology has a history of its own . Although nowadays associated almost exclusively with Hubbard 's work , it was coined by the philologist Alan Upward in 1907 as a synonym for `` pseudoscience '' . [ 6 ] ( http : //www.instinct.org/texts/bluesky/bs3-4.htm ) In 1934 , the Argentine-German writer Anastasius Nordenholz published a book using the word positively : Scientologie , Wissenschaft von der Beschaffenheit und der Tauglichkeit des Wissens , or Scientology , Science of the Constitution and Usefulness of Knowledge . [ 7 ] ( http : //www.scientologie.de/scientologie/index.htm ) Nordenholz 's book is a study of consciousness , and its usage of the word is not greatly different from Hubbard 's definition , `` knowing how to know '' . However , it is not clear to what extent Hubbard was aware of these earlier usages . The word itself is",0

"who is william blake ? William Blake ( November 28 , 1757 – August 12 , 1827 ) was an English poet , painter and printmaker . Though largely unrecognised during his lifetime , today Blake 's work is almost universally considered that of a genius . According to Northrop Frye , who undertook a study of Blake 's entire poetic opus , his prophetic poems form `` what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the [ English ] language '' . Others have praised Blake 's visual artistry , in particular his engravings : `` [ Blake ] is far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever produced '' [ 1 ] .However , viewing Blake 's accomplishments in either poetry or in the visual arts separately is to do him a disservice ; Blake himself saw these two disciplines as being cohorts in a unified spiritual endeavour , and they are inseparable in a proper appreciation of his work .",0
"do clouds freeze ? if clouds are like water , why do n't they ? and if they do , why do n't they like fall and shatter .

However , the cloud always remains water vapor untill that time.If there were no winds , ect , or the winds were not that strong , then the clouds would all freeze , and you would have huge mile or more long blocks of ice falling from the sky : )",0

"explain why the copper rod can not be charged by rubbing ? A perspex rod may be positively charged by rubbing it with a cloth , but a copper rod held in a hand can not be charged in this way.by the way , i want an intelligent answer in detail . Perspex is a plastic ... a non-conductor.Copper is a conductor . Conductors do n't hold charge , they conduct it , meaning they transport it away . 'Charging ' up a conductor may transfer charge to it , but it will easily 'conduct ' it away from itself.The plastic rod wo n't conduct , so as charge is transferreed to it , the charge is sort of trapped on the rod , and builds until a noticeable static charge builds .",0

"Will road rage occur ? Traveling in a car at the speed of sound , you blow your horn at the car in front of you also traveling at the speed of sound . Will the car in front of you hear the horn ? Will he give you the finger if he does ? The sound will reach the car in front of you . Although it may seem as though it would not , considering that you are already traveling at the speed of sound , therefore you may think the sound waves go as the same speed as your car therefore not traveling any faster than you are and not getting to the car in front of you . However , this is not the case . This can be explained using Einstein 's theory of relativity . Einstein describes `` frames of reference '' and in your frame of reference , you are not moving ; everything else is moving . Everything in your car is stationary relative to everything else , this is why you do n't feel like you 're moving , and if you throw a book sideways , it does n't fly backwards with the speed your vehicle is moving , this is because the car , yourself , and the book are all moving with the same speed your car is moving . They are all stationary relative to each other . When the sound waves are created , they move in all directions at the speed of sound ( 331 m/s ) , so in your frame of reference , they would be moving at 331 m/s away from the car in all directions . This means from the frame of reference of a person standing outside of your car , the sound waves would actually appear to be moving at twice the speed of sound . This is just like if you threw a ball forward out from the car at 15 m/s , it would appear to an outsider to be moving at that speed plus the speed of sound ( well in a vacuum anyway , or before air resistance took over ) To use a better example of these frames of reference , you know that the earth is rotating . It is rotating at 1070 mi/hr at the equator , yet it seems not to be moving at all , it is our frame of reference when we are standing 'still . ' the speed of sound is no different traveling in different directions on the earth because of this rotation.and yes , he would probably give you the finger . I mean , he is going at the speed of sound , how impatient are you ?",0

If we had picked a diffeent standard temperature , then the molar volume would be different.Using PV = nRT , you can calculate the value for molar volume . V is the unknown and n = 1.00 mol . Set P and T to their standard values and use R = 0.08206 .",0
"how to correct red eye in photography ? If you want to eliminate red-eye before your photo even makes it into the computer : Red eye is caused when flash is fired directly into the eye , bounces off the red blood vessels at the back of the eye , and is reflected back into the lens.The solution would be to fire the flash at an angle , for example , downwards towards the subjects , rather than right at them . This would require an external flash unit that has a swivel head , and of course , for inexpensive point and shoots , this is not really an option , but I put it out there . Not only will you eliminate red eye but you will greatly improve the look of your photos is you learn how to use an external flash unit properly and bounce light off nearby walls.Or , in some cases , why not turn off the flash altogether and prop your camera against a surface or use a tripod , and get the subjects to stay still a little . Not possible when you 're in the middle of the action , or in very poorly lit areas , but sometimes doable . Your pictures will be a lot better off without the harsh light that those built in flash units provide .",0

"When buying DVD Movies , what is the difference between full frame and wide screen movies ? The difference is due to something called `` aspect ratio '' . Widescreen movies have a 16:9 aspect ratio , meaning that they are more rectangular than square in the shape of the screen ( the screen is wider than regular , hence the term `` widescreen '' ) . The difference in the picture is that with widescreen , you see more on the edges of the picture . For instance , if there were 100 trees in a shot , with full frame you might only see 70 of them because the edges are cut off a bit . To me , this makes a difference in the movie , but not so much that you would have a different understanding of the film . Moving forward , I would say that you should buy your movies in 16:9 or widescreen format because more and more TV 's are now in that format .",0

"What are the main aplications of `` Chaos Theory '' ? There have not been many direct applications of chaos theory so far , but the study of chaos and the emphasis on understanding chaos has given us new methods of research.One of the best examples I can think of is agent-based modelling in social sciences . For example , in theoretical combat , there is an old equation called Lanchester 's equation of combat , which predicts the casualty rate in a given time period for two different armies o fgiven sizes with given accuracies . Unfortunately , it tends not to be terribly accurate in numerical forescasts of battle outcomes . This is because the battle outcome depnds on the behavior of individual troops on the battlefield , and small changes in their behavior can cause big changes in battle outcome.The idea that small changes in an input cause big changes in an output is the essence of chaos theory . This has led to agent based modelling in which researchers assign behavioral attributes to individual troops rather than use a single variable to define a whole army . The computer calculates each troops interation with his own troops and with the enemy 's , and you get an outcome . Small changes in troop behavior will cause large changes in outcome . This can tell researchers what behaviors of soldiers may be most important to modify even slghtly.Observations of very different outcomes from small changes in starting conditions have led reserachers in all sorts of other fields to also attempt to understand this difference . Chemical engineers are often trying to understand tubulence and how small changes in pipe shapes can casue big changes in the way fluid flows .",0

"How do you play tennis ? First , you get a partner and get on a tennis court . Then , at the start of the game , choose who will serve first.EX : You serve 1st . Start behind the bottom line of the court on you side . Hit the ball into the opposite square on your opponent 's side of the court . Make sure you do n't pass the little white line in the center . If you do n't in the first try , that is a fault . If the ball hits the top of the net and goes over to the other side , that is a let . Redo . No faults , no points . You get a second try . Try to hit the opposite square on your opponents side of the court . If you miss again , that is a double fault and your opponent gets a point . The score would say 0-15 . ( server 's score is always first ) Now , you switch sides ( from one square to the other ) If you succeed , and he/she ca n't return it , that is called an ace . You get one point ( 15-15 ) Now you go back to where you started . ( It alternates each point ) Now , you serve , and your opponent hits it back to you . It has to go over the net , and in front the line from where you serve , and not in the two boxes at the sides of the court . ( Only in play for doubles ) It is 40-30 now . You score . You win the game . NOT THE WHOLE GAME ! The whole game is called a match . A match is seperated into sets , then games . You win the first set , ( out of your choise , 3 or 5 sets . ) 6-4 . ( 6 games to win a set and by 2 games . There is a tiebraker , but I do n't know that . Sorry . ) 2nd set : You win 7-5 . You win the Match .

"Why the shape of rainbow is as a semi-circle ? When light is refracted off of droplets of water it enables you to see all the colors that make up white light ( sunlight , even light from bulbs . ) creating what people more commonly refer to as a rainbow . Go outside on a sunny day and spray the waterhose if you have one . If you look very carefully , you can see that the rainbow you created is not just a semi-circle , but a full circle ! The bottom half is harder to see , but it is there . The reason rainbows do n't look like that when we see them outside is because we are too low to the ground to see the rest .",0

They told me that they didnt think education was important so they went to work after high school . I didnt listen to them .

"what is lipoma and what types of procedures are used to remove it ? Lipomas are benign , slow-growing tumors that come from fat cells . They are not cancer . They are usually round , moveable , flattened lumps under the skin . They feel soft and doughy or rubbery . Lipomas usually grow in the neck , shoulders , back , or arms . They can occur at any age , but they often appear when you 're between 40 and 60 years of age . Sometimes they run in families . Sometimes they are caused by an injury . Most lipomasdo not hurt unless they are squeezed or bruised.Because lipomas are almost always benign ( not cancer ) , they usually do not need treatment . If they are painful or are growing quickly , you may want to have treatment . Treatment options include steroid shots , liposuction , or surgery . Your doctor can help you decide what is best for you.As always , check with your doctor to make sure it is a lipoma and to discuss treatment .",0

"what is the significance of the elephant logo for the oakland A 's ? its one thing that has always perplexed me . Can someone give me a reason why its a elephant ? After New York Giants manager John McGraw told reporters that Philadelphia manufacturer Benjamin Shibe , who owned the controlling interest in the new team , had a “ white elephant on his hands , '' Mack defiantly adopted the white elephant as the team mascot , though over the years the elephant has appeared in several different colors ( currently forest green ) . The A ’ s are sometimes , though infrequently , referred to as the Elephants or White Elephants.The elephant was retired as team mascot in 1963 by then-owner Charles O. Finley in favor of a Missouri mule . In 1986 , the elephant was restored as the symbol of the Athletics and currently adorns the left sleeve of home and road uniforms .",0
"What exactly is antimatter ? Howmuch of it has been produced till today ? Antimatter or contra-terrene matter is matter that is composed of the antiparticles of those that constitute normal matter . If a particle and its antiparticle come in contact with each other , the two annihilate and produce a burst of energy , which results in the production of other particles and antiparticles or electromagnetic radiation . In these reactions , rest mass is not conserved , although ( as in any other reaction ) energy ( E=mc² ) is conserved.Scientists in 1995 succeeded in producing antiatoms of hydrogen , and also antideuteron nuclei , made out of an antiproton and an antineutron , but no antiatom more complex than antideuterium has been created yet . In principle , antiatoms of any element could be built from readily available sources of antiparticles . Such antiatoms would have exactly the same properties as their normal-matter counterparts . The production of antielements in bulk quantities seems unlikely to ever become achievable , however.Positrons and antiprotons can individually be stored in a device called a Penning trap , which uses a combination of magnetic field and electric fields to hold charged particles in a vacuum . Two international collaborations , ATRAP and ATHENA , used these devices to store thousands of slowly moving antihydrogen atoms in 2002 . It is the goal of these collaborations to probe the energy level structure of antihydrogen to compare it with that of hydrogen as a test of the CPT theorem . One way to do this is to confine the antiatoms in an inhomogenous magnetic field ( one can not use electric fields since the antiatoms are neutral ) and interrogate them with lasers . If the anti-atoms have too much kinetic energy they will be able to escape the magnetic trap , and it is therefore essential that the anti-atoms be produced with as little energy as possible . This is the key difference between the antihydrogen that ATRAP and ATHENA produced , which was made at very low temperatures , and the antihydrogen produced in 1995 which was moving at a speed close to the speed of light.Antimatter/matter reactions have practical applications in medical imaging , such as positron emission tomography ( PET ) . In some kinds of beta decay , a nuclide loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron ( in the same event , a proton becomes a neutron , and neutrinos are also given off ) . Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a cyclotron and are widely generated for medical use.Antiparticles are created everywhere in the universe where high-energy particle collisions take place , such as in the center of our galaxy , but none has been detected that is residual from the Big Bang , as most normal matter is . [ 1 ] The unequal distribution between matter and antimatter in the universe has long been a mystery . The solution likely lies in the violation of CP-symmetry by the laws of nature ; see baryogenesis.how much produced it is on and on and on",0

"interfaith marriage ? How can a devoted Catholic woman overcome restrictions in the bible ( which she believes in ) to marry a non-Christian ? I suppose today 's society is n't as tribal as the past societies or the ones you still see in 3rd world countries where women were nothing but chattel.Based on that it 's quite simple today to find someone you love having most of the qualities you desire - yes , even in the religious sense.A devout Catholic women should be chaste and so must her husband . Both should have a pure state of mind and believe in God.There are many non-Christians who are n't Christians or Catholics but still have a sense of God , but are not ready to make a huge commitment to the Christian or Catholic faith if they 're not ready yet.Many non-Christians are chaste , have pure , good hearts and I 'm sure we all know not all Christians are better than non-Christians . I 've met alot of non-Christians with hearts of gold that 'd put many hollow-faithed and judgemental Christians to great shame if they were put together.It maybe a matter of time before this person actually decides to take God and Christ into his or her heart , or through the spouse 's good conduct and deep faith , decide that , yes , the children are better off having a religion then just skulking around in the wide open space looking for something.So , I do n't think we should judge non-Christians harshly - unless as individuals they have less-than-honourable conduct and character . It takes a lot of love , effort , acceptance and faith in God , as well as time , for the spouse to realise that yes , I want to accept Christ in my life.And of course , when the children come their religious beliefs will form naturally in the family .",0
"Does size of the male member really matter and if so why ? What about other dimensions ? If we 're talking strictly about sensation produced during the act of intercourse , then it 's the circumfrence that is more important than the length as the sensation comes from friction and you need a larger circumfrence to enhance skin to skin contact to make friction.Too many men think it 's the length when their women are complaining to their women friends of cramping and pain because their man tried to jam it all up there.The other poster said it 's technique and this is also true because if you 've got a long one your woman will make excuses not to have sex if you do n't learn how to use it properly . How ? Ask her ! Do not deceive yourselves that we are not aware of your lack of expertise . But that does n't matter as long as you 're willing to talk about it and learn what we like and do n't like . A partner who cares about what we want and like and tries to please us , as much as we try to please them , more than makes up for any alleged physical lack .",0

"Italian American Reconciliation by : John Patrick Shanley ? First Produced 1986 Eugene O'Neill Theater Center , Waterford , CT , USA > > > Published 1989 Dramatist Play Service , NY Genre Comic Folktale Parts Male 2 Female 3 Other Synopsis : Huey Maximilian Bonfigliano has a problem : While he is safely divorced from his shrewish first wife , Janice , who shot his dog and even took a bead on him , he feels he can not regain his `` manhood '' until he woos and wins her one more timeif only to put his broken marriage behind him once and for all . He enlists the aid of his lifelong buddy , Aldo Scalicki , a confirmed bachelor who tries , without apparent success , to convince Huey that he would be better off sticking with his new lady friend , Teresa , a usually placid young waitress whose indignation flares when she learns what Huey is up to . In a moonlit balcony scene ( hilariously reminiscent of Cyrano de Bergerac ) Aldo pleads his lovesick friend 's case and , to his astonishment , Janice capitulatesalthough not for long . However we do learn that her earlier abuse of Huey was intended to make him `` act like a man '' which , at last , he does . And , more than that , he ( and the audience ) become aware that , in the final essence , `` the greatestand onlysuccess is to be able to love '' a truth which emerges delightfully from the heartwarming , wonderfully antic and always imaginatively conceived action of the play .",0

"what is Tourette Syndrome ? Tourette Syndrome Gilles de la Tourette syndrome ( Tourette Syndrome or TS ) is a neurological disorder which becomes evident in early childhood or adolescence between the ages of 2 and 15 . Tourette syndrome is defined by multiple motor and vocal tics lasting for more than one year . Many people have only motor tics or only vocal tics . The first symptoms usually are involuntary movements ( tics ) of the face , arms , limbs or trunk . These tics are frequent , repetitive and rapid . The most common first symptom is a facial tic ( eye blink , nose twitch , grimace ) , and is replaced or added to by other tics of the neck , trunk , and limbs . These involuntary ( outside the patient 's control ) tics may also be complicated , involving the entire body , such as kicking and stamping . Many person report what are described as premonitory urges -- the urge to perform a motor activity . Other symptoms such as touching , repetitive thoughts and movements and compulsions can occur . There are also verbal tics . These verbal tics ( vocalizations ) usually occur with the movements ; later they may replace one or more motor tics . These vocalizations include grunting , throat clearing , shouting and barking . The verbal tics may also be expressed as coprolalia ( the involuntary use of obscene words or socially inappropriate words and phrases ) or copropraxia ( obscene gestures ) . Despite widespread publicity , coprolalia/copropraxia is uncommon with tic disorders",0

"why is the Van Allen radiation belts have to surround to earth ? The Van Allen belts have very little to do with the earth 's core as the other answer suggested . They are believed to be created by the eath 's magnetic field interacting with charged particles known as solar wind . To the extent that we believe the earth 's core responsible for creating the earth 's magnetic field , I guess the earth 's core has some relevance . As the solar winds encounter the earth 's magnetic field , the radiation becomes trapped within the field . They are repelled from areas of stronger magnetic field where field lines converge . Two alternative hypotheses have been proposed . Possibly the Van Allen Belts are lefor over from the aurora , and another argument is that they are the result of volcanic activity of the earth . Some scientists beleive that they may have a beneficial effect on the planet providing some protection from solar wind , and that weakening them would harm both electronics and living organisms . there has been a proposal to reduce the charge of the belts , which are a hazard to satellites .",0
"why does society say the skinnier you are , the prettier and more accepted you will be ? I think it 's based off of society valuing what influential and rich people that they iconize look like . The `` elite '' have the time and resources to devote to looking their `` best '' and usually that best is the opposite of what the average person in society looks like.In the US it 's hard to stay fit because most of us do n't have jobs that keep us physically fit ( or in the case of kids , they do n't `` get out and play '' as much as they used to ) . Also the cheapest food that is available is the worst for you but is the highest quantity that most people in the US consume which leads to so many people being overweight . So the opposite ( being skinny ) is what 's idolized . Mostly it 's wealthy people who have time to excersize and `` personal trainers '' and such to help them stay fit ... the rest of us are on our own.Back a few hundred years ago , if you were overweight it was a major status symbol because adequate nutrition was hard to come by , and if you had enough food to be fat , you must have been really well off . Again , what was attractive was the opposite of the average person who had to work hard at manual labor and probably did n't get enough to eat and so was skinny.Tanning is another example ... a while ago it was considered unattractive because if you were tanned it meant you were some serf working outside all day instead of being able to stay inside away from the sun . Now it 's the wealthy that have the most leisure time to spend outdoors so tanning is what 's considered attractive .",0

"what is a good diet to follow for losing weight ? Do not skip meals . Have a fat-free diet with lots of fibre in it.Avoid fried and oily stuff , red meat , eggs , sugar , alcohol , coke , milk , butter etc . Walk at a brisk pace for minimum 45 minutes daily . Salads , soups , fruits low in sweetness are good . Have brown bread , skimmed milk . Lots of water and liquid diet also help . Keep a record of what you eat , how long you walk or excercise , and your weight on a daily basis.Cabbage soup is supposed to be a good fat burner . This alongwith veg salads and fruits for one week with walking daily twice for 30 minutes can bring down weight by 3 pounds . Do not do this continuously beyond a week at a time . You can do so every alternate week . Have a b-complex tablet every alternate day.If you have any side effects , see a doctor.Wish you all the very best .",0

"Is mastarbation harmful for health ? Health and psychological effectsIt is held in many mental health circles that masturbation can relieve depression and lead to a higher sense of self-worth . Masturbation can also be particularly useful in relationships where one partner wants more sex than the other—in which case masturbation provides a balancing effect and thus a more harmonious relationship.Both from the standpoint of avoiding unwanted pregnancy and that of avoiding sexually transmitted diseases , masturbation is the safest of sexual practices . There is no credible scientific or medical evidence that manual masturbation is damaging to either one 's mental or physical health.A man whose penis has suffered `` an invasive procedure , blunt trauma or injury during intercourse '' [ 2 ] may suffer later in life from Peyronie 's disease . Usually in the context of an abnormal tunica albuginea , the rare event of penile fracture [ 3 ] may occur . Phimosis is `` a contracted foreskin ( that ) may cause trouble by hurting when an attempt is made to pull the foreskin back '' [ 4 ] . In each of these cases , overly aggressive manipulation of the penis can be problematic.Contrary to popular myth , masturbation does not cause blindness . There is some basis , however , to the myth : zinc is required both to transport vitamin A from the liver to the retina and is excreted in relatively high amount in semen . Thus , it is not inconceivable that in zinc-deficient or vitamin A-deficient environments excessive male masturbation could have caused night blindness ( in which case sexual intercourse has an equal probability of causing blindness ) . Given a normal contemporary diet , however , this is extremely unlikely to happen . There is also the more modern issue of staring at a computer screen while watching pornography for extended periods of time as the pupils tend to dilate during arousal.The only side-effects recorded are that repeated masturbation may result in tiredness or soreness , which tend to make repeated masturbation self-limiting in any case . For men , the volume of ejaculate is temporarily reduced after multiple ejaculations until normal seminal volume is regained in a day or so . Nevertheless , people may experience feelings of guilt during or after masturbation , especially if they come from a socially conservative or religious background.Solitary masturbation carries no risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases . Masturbation involving both a man and a woman can result in pregnancy only if semen contacts the vulva . Any masturbation with a partner can theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted disease by contact with bodily fluids , and such contact should be avoided with any partner whose disease status is uncertain . Objects inserted into the vagina or anus should be clean and of a kind that will not scratch or break . Care should be taken not to fully insert anything into the anus—any object used should have a flared or flanged base ; otherwise retrieval can require a visit to the emergency room . Most modern dildos and anal plugs are designed with this feature.In 1994 , when the first woman appointed Surgeon General of the United States , Dr. Joycelyn Elders , mentioned as an aside that perhaps it ought to be mentioned in school curricula that masturbation was safe and healthy , she was forced to resign , with opponents asserting that she was promoting the teaching of how to masturbate . Many believe this was the result of her long history of promoting controversial viewpoints and not due solely to her public mention of masturbation .

"who are muslims ? A Muslim is a believer in or follower of Islam . The word Muslim means one who submits and implies complete submission to the will of God ( Allah ) . Muslims believe that nature is itself Islamic , since it follows natural laws placed by God . Thus , a Muslim strives to surrender to God 's commands every step of the way.Until recently the word was also spelled Moslem . Muslims do not recommend this spelling because it is often pronounced `` mawzlem , '' which sounds like an Arabic word for `` oppressor . '' Many English-language writers used to call Muslims `` Mohammedans '' or `` Mahometans '' , meaning `` followers of Mohammed '' , but this terminology is considered incorrect and insulting , because Muslims believe it implies that they worship the prophet Muhammad , contrary to the fundamental principles of Islam itself.Sources of IslamSunni sources of IslamThe Holy Quran Ahadith ( singular Hadith ) - recordings of the life of the Prophet Muhammad , reported by any one of his companions .

"How to deal with my 10 yrs old daughter that is always late and seems she does n't understand that time goes by Some people do not have good concepts of time regardless of what others tell them . It might be in part due to ADD or some other cognitive issue or that they might become so present in each moment that they are unable to think about anything else mundane and necessary such as time and that they have to conform to it 's limits . ADD can have bizarre opposites like not being aware of or focused enough to notice something like time , but then being so focused on what you 're doing that you are unaware of time ... Contrary but it occurs . But please do n't rush to drugs if you find they have ADD . Drugs are n't always the answer and can have horrible side effects , ritalin is just pharmaceutical speed . Awareness and education and remaining involved in an activity they love is the best bet for ADD-like issues.Talk to her nicely about it . Explain that unfortunately in this modern world , one we do n't have much of a choice about living in unless we want to live in the woods , have to conform to a little to be able to get along and function well in . Help her understand what the consequences of time management are about and the downfalls of it to herself and to others . Nicely of course . No pressure but engage her conscience so that she feels responsible for the affect she has upon another person when she is late . You can also enlist tools such as a large clock that she can understand with hands/dials or digital numbers . Help her practice what time she begins something , how long she will be at it and then when she will stop that activity to begin another ... etc . Or a timer that she can set for a distinct amount of time so that when it goes off she knows she has something she has to get ready for next and allows her time to plan . Ask her what her beliefs are about time and her responsibility to others is in regards to being on time . Ask her what 's going on , engage her opinion even if she has to figure it out as you go . It will help her become conscious of the situation beyond your frustration and into her role in it.Look into different methods in the educational department or section for kids with learning disabilities ( even if she does n't have one ) . The resources are good and you can use them to your advantage , like I said even if she does n't have one . Good luck !",0

"Why is Curling a sport much less and Olympic event ? Seriously ... .Curling ? ... My Brother in law ( who I love very much ) is a big , burly biker who co-owns a strip bar ... .and NASCAR , foootball and yes.. loves Curling ... .I do n't get it ... . I think because anything classified as a sporting event it requires a certain degree of athleticism , skill , practice , dedication , and ( in the case of team sports ) team-work ; add in an opportunity to test your levels against others to find out who is best and you have a sporting event ( you mentioned NASCAR in your question details ... driving a car in a big circle for a couple of hours does n't require much athleticism either , but it is still considered a sport , right ? ) Now why it is considered an Olympic event ... well , it is a sport with growing popularity in many countries that participate in the Olympics ( Canada , many of the northern European countries , and a growing fan-base in the northern United States ) , and the Olympics have been a fairground for countries to show off new and/or unusual sporting events from around the world ( Ice Dancing ... the poor-man 's figure skating OR `` I 'm just doing this until Disney-on-Ice calls me in for an interview ! '' ) . Some of the events catch on and become world-wide phenomenons , others fizzle and die. < Added > I added athleticism to the list of skills needed because there is a degree of athleticism to curling that you do n't find in other strategy games ( chess , for example ) . I mean , watch the curlers in the Olympics . They are running around on ICE for Pete 's sake ! Any time I step on ice I fall on my ... personality ... but these guys are running up and down the ice as if they were walking in the grass ! And it is n't just the shoes they wear .

"What made you interested in web accessibility ? As with CSS , my first real contact with accessibility came with my job at Salford . Although I was peripherally aware of the concept , and had previously heard mentions of the WCAG ( Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ) , it was never something I thought I needed to concern myself with . However , researching some of the legal requirements involving educational websites in the UK , I inevitably came across SENDA ( Special Educational Needs and Disabilities Act ) and the wider DDA ( Disabilities Discrimination Act ) . To summarise very broadly , the DDA demands , among other things , that the provision of goods and services should be ( within reason ) accessible to anybody . In its initial state , the DDA did only cover businesses and government bodies , making a special exception for educational establishments . SENDA , which effectively became part IV of the DDA , removed this special status , bringing education back under the general provisions of the main DDA . Although the Act itself does not directly mention web sites , the 'Code of Practice - Rights of Access Goods , Facilities , Services and premises ' does , and it is understood that therefore all government , education and business sites need to make 'reasonable adjustments ' to ensure a basic level of accessibility . So , having started my position as web editor at the University of Salford and realising the legal requirement imposed by SENDA/DDA , I began delving deeper into the subject of accessibility . What I found was that , even among 'seasoned ' web managers in the UK education sector and beyond , there was a lot of ignorance and confusion - coupled with misinformed management concerned with 'Bobby validation ' as the be all and end all . This sorry state of affairs , combined with the fact that , deep down , I feel that accessibility is simply the ethically/morally right thing to do , led me to explore this subject further . I find it fascinating that even though in recent years more and more sites , books and even conferences have been devoted to accessibility , there are still many grey areas once you move beyond the basics , where even experts can furiously disagree . It 's not all cut and dry , and in many instances one has to take a pragmatic approach , weighing up how things should be done ( according to things like W3C specifications or even common sense ) against how they work in practice ( in light of flaky browser or assistive technology support , for instance ) .",0

"why do farts smell ? So why do farts smell ? Fermented food produces different types of fumes , some of which smell . Flatulence contains odorless gases , such as nitrogen , carbon dioxide , oxygen , and methane , but it also contains the `` oh-so-nasty '' hydrogen sulfide , which causes the smell . If you have not noticed by now , some of the aforementioned fumes are flammable , like methane and oxygen , so you can , in fact , burn farts . Yes , you can set them aflame ; it is not a myth.How much odor is produced also depends on the food you eat . Vegetarians might fart as often as meat-eaters , but their farts do not smell as much because vegetables produce less hydrogen sulfide . The more sulfur rich the foods you eat , the more your farts will stink because bacteria will generate sulfides and mercaptans as they break down the nutrients . Beware : even though cauliflower is a vegetable , it also makes you stinky , so watch out !",0

HMMMM some very interesting answers here that I like ... .Such as the rubber band idea . I would recomend that idea and see if that helps . If not ... .First of all as a former thumb sucker and smoker I understand oral fixations ( I quit the thumb thing a 12 started smoking at 13 and just quit that at 22 , about two months ago ) . Even now you will usually catch me with a touthpick , rubber band , bottle lid , pencils , or other item in my mouth . I have seriously cut back the habbit and consiously have to make efforts not to do it . Here are some suggestions . First of all peppers contain volitale oils that can chemically burn skin so avoid those . Purchase some alum powder and mix the powder with a few drops of water ( Enough to make a slightly runny paste . ) and soak your fingers in it . Alum is very , unpleasantly bitter and will immediately make your mouth pucker . Some people like lemon juice or tobasco so using those items usually does n't work because the taste is n't very strong . Next put up sticky notes at the places you are most like to do this . Repeating to yourself that this is bad trains your mind to avoid doing it subconsciously . If you are like me you also put your hand on your face ( or chin in hand , whatever ) . You can curb this action as well by improving your posture . Freeze yourself the next time you catch yourself doing this ( or finger chewing ) and analyze how you are sitting . Usually slumped with your elbow on the table or with your elbow semi supported by your stomach or chest . If you start improving your posture then you will become less inclined to hold your arm up unsupported for very long . I am using an exercise ball for a computer chair right now to retrain my posture . My doctor recomended it and I highly agree , I 've already noticed a difference.Cheer up though . Some studies say that finger chewing , nail biting , and other oral fixations are all signs of higher intelligence . It is believed that the brain in these cases works so fast that it actually gets bored or is somehow unstimulated . By controlling physical movement while mental processes such as reading or talking occur your brain is exercising itself and making you smarter and faster by training itself to multitask.Oh and a side note . Many people often notice that they chew nails/fingers in response to nervousness . The sucking/chewing motion is deeply ingrained in our most primitive side as being calming . When we are babies and we recieve food ( suckle ) subconciously we are aware of being protected by our mothers . The sucking/chewing motion along with full belly releases seratonin in the child inducing pleasure and happiness . In response to certain stresses adults will ocassionally do the same thing for the chemical calm it can induce , without even thinking about it . I tend to do this in the store especially when I ca n't find something . I feel lost and confused and tend to stick the tip of one or more finger in my mouth while looking .",0
"Why do girls with a boyfriend complain about their man to other SINGLE guys that are interested in them ? Girls love to be proud of their guy , and tell the world how great he is . If a girl is actually complaining about her man , it means that she wants you to know she 's not entirely happy ... and usually this means she 's interested in your opinion ( or in you , but this may not have even occured to her yet ) . ... if you 're the single guy she 's complaining to , well - this all sounds great . Problem is , you 'd be getting her on a rebound call , and that 's no good . I 've been there ... a number of times , and while I ca n't say with honesty that it wo n't work 100 % of the time , I also ca n't imagine it works very often at all .",0

"has any one out there taken the diet pill herbathin ? and how did it affect you ? Diet pills do work , although not forever . You see , diet pills are like any other drug your body builds resistance to them and their effectiveness wears off when you take them for a while . They do work short term but there are better ways to boost your metabolism and lose the weight.There are several ways to boost your metabolism but lets look at the factors that drive your metabolism first . 1 . Genetics - you have very little control , but you are not a prisoner of your genes . 2 . Lean Muscle Mass - this one throws most people off because women think , oh no I dont want muscles and men think I guess I have to look like a body builder . Lean muscle mass is simply your weight minus the weight of your organs , bones , fluids and fat . You increase lean muscle mass primarily through eating properly , resistance exercise , and a lifestyle that doesnt promote catabolizing activites ( smoking , heavy drinking and drug use ) 3 . Frequency of meals - the more meals the more the metabolic processes take place in your body and the faster your metabolism.4 . Water Intake - dehydration is a major drag on metabolism.Most people are dehydrated and they dont know it.5 . Sleep - getting enough rest allows the body to function at a higher metabolic level.You will learn more than you ever knew about metabolism from my source .

"How would you explain the word , Elysium ? and what other words mean the same ? In Greek mythology , Elysium was a section of the Underworld ( the spelling Elysium is a Latinization of the Greek word Elysion ) . `` Elysium is an obscure and mysterious name that evolved from a designation of a place or person struck by lightning , enelysion , enelysios . ( Burkert 1985 p. 198 ) The Elysian fields , or sometimes Elysian plains , were the final resting place of the souls of the heroic and the virtuous . Two passages in Homer established for Greeks the nature of the Afterlife : the dreamed apparition of the dead Patroclus in the Iliad and the more daring boundary-breaking visit in Odyssey . Greek traditions concerning funerary ritual were reticent , but the Homeric examples encouraged other heroic visits , in the myth cycles accreted upon Theseus and upon Heracles ( Campbell 1948 ; Ruck and Staples 1994 ) .The Elysian Fields lay on the western margin of the earth , by the encircling stream of Oceanus ( Odyssey ) , and there the mortal relatives of the king of the gods were transported , without tasting death , to enjoy an immortality of bliss ( Odyssey book iv : 563 ) . Hesiod refers to the Isles of the Blessed ( makarôn nêsoi ) in the Western Ocean ( Works and Days ) . Pindar makes it a single Isle . Walter Burkert notes the connection with the motif of far-off Dilmun : `` Thus Achilles is transported to the White Isle and becomes the Ruler of the Black Sea , and Diomedes becomes the divine lord of an Adriatic island . '' ( Burkert 1985 , p. 198 ) .In Elysium were fields of the pale liliaceous asphodel , and poplars grew . There stood the gates that led to the house of Ais ( in Attic dialect `` Hades '' ) .",0

"Wireless internet connection ? Hi , our wireless router at home doesnot allow more than one person to get online at the same time , anybody knows the reason and solution . many thanks , the router maker is Linksys , and we bought it just under one year ago . Every computer requires a unique address called the IP accress for connecting to the Internet . Its like a home , every home needs a specific address so that the postal system can forward postal mail . Earlier routers ( as the one that you have ) may not allow multiple IP allocation so you may not be able to use the router with multiple computers . However , what you can do is set up a home wireless computer . The main computer connects to the Internet and other computers connect wirelessly to the main computer so that the main computer acts as the Internet proxy.For more info , go to this website : http : //www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm ? articleID=1428",0
"What is a good gift for someone that just passed the BAR exam ? Any attorneys out there ... what were some of the gifts you received ? My good friends who passed the bar have received a wide variety of gifts.I got my best friend from college a bottle of Macallan 18 year old single malt scotch .

"I know somebody that does not want to go back to college . He begins to cry and he says he hates it. ? How can I help him ? For some , college can be their first push into independence . It can be terribly hard for those that have not had much experience in the world . Also , for those that have not socialized much before , college can be very intimidating . All of a sudden they are put into an environment where social contact is a constant.I can speak from experience- when first arriving at college I hated it . Roomates , no privacy , it was awful for me . However , when I gave it a little time those roomates that I loathed became great friends . Now the situation that I looked upon with so much disdain is now one of the most treasured periods of my life.My suggestion is to visit him at college . With having someone familiar there it will make him more comfortable . Perhaps help him break the ice with some other students . Also , let him know that he 's not the only one feeling that way . However , he needs to start owning his experience . Let him know that college is a great time to be able to learn and experience everything HE wants . There 's no one there to tell him what not to do . That be scary at first , but when he finally feels what it 's like to be independent , he 'll come around.Best of luck !",0

"What are the effects that ketosis has on the adult body ? A few yrs ago i began losing a substantial amount of weight , my drs did a battery of tests from diabetis to thyroid- they came up with ketosis saying that is what caused the weight loss and explains my neverending thirst and bouts with dehydration . I have researched and I still dont understand ketosis . Anyone else have this experience ? `` Ketosis , which is one of the body 's processes for the metabolism of body fat , should not be confused with ketoacidosis ( severe ketosis which causes the blood to become acidic ) , a medical condition induced by diabetes , that is usually accompanied by dehydration , hyperglycemia , and insulin deficiency . Since insulin is required to utilize glucose , lack of insulin causes an energy crisis and the body goes to extremes to produce more glucose and also provide ketones for energy . Glucose accumulates to the point that the kidney must use water to spill it into the urine , losing that water and causing dehydration in the process . The dehydration exacerbates the acidosis in a vicious cycle . Alcoholic ketoacidosis is also an energy crisis but of different origin . Because alcohol causes dehydration and blocks the first step of gluconeogenesis , the body is unable to synthesize enough glucose to meet its needs , thus the energy crisis begins.The breath of people in a ketagenic state commonly contains acetone , detectable as a sweet smell that may be mistaken for ethyl alcohol.Deliberately induced ketosis through a low-carbohydrate diet has been used to treat medical conditions . The ketogenic diet is an approach to treating epilepsy , and the Atkins Nutritional Approach is marketed for treating obesity . ''",0
what do you have to take to be a nurse ? in college Registered Nurses generally receive their basic preparation through one of three basic avenues : Graduation from an associate 's degree-granting nursing program ( approximately three years of college level study with a strong emphasis on clinical knowledge and skills ) earning the degree of ASN/AAS in Nursing.Graduation with a three-year ( diploma ) certificate from a hospital-based school of nursing ( non-degree ) . Few of these programs remain in the US and the proportion of nurses practicing with a diploma is rapidly decreasing.Graduation from a university with a bachelor 's degree in nursing ( a four - five year program conferring the BSN/BN degree with enhanced emphasis on leadership and research as well as clinically-focused courses ) .As far as courses : Anatomy and physiologyMicrobiologyPharmacology and medication administrationPsychologyNursing ethicsNursing theoryNursing practiceLegal issues in nursing practice,0

"why was Thomas More beheaded ? More refused to attend the coronation of Anne Boleyn as the Queen of England . Shortly thereafter More was charged with accepting bribes , but the patently false charges had to be dismissed for lack of any evidence . In 1534 he was accused of conspiring with Elizabeth Barton , a nun who had prophesized against the king 's divorce , but More was able to produce a letter in which he had instructed Barton not to interfere with state matters.On April 13 of that year More was asked to appear before a commission and swear his allegiance to the parliamentary Act of Succession . More accepted Parliament 's right to declare Anne the legitimate queen of England , but he refused to take the oath because an anti-papal preface to the Act made of it an acknowledgement of Parliament 's authority to legislate in matters of religion by denying the authority of the Pope , which More would not accept . Four days later he was imprisoned in the Tower of London , where he wrote his devotional Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation.On July 1 , 1535 , More was tried before a panel of judges that included the new Lord Chancellor , Sir Thomas Audley , as well as Anne Boleyn 's father , brother , and uncle . He was charged with high treason for denying the validity of the Act of Succession . More believed he could not be convicted as long as he did not explicitly deny that the king was the head of the church , and he therefore refused to answer all questions regarding his opinions on the subject . Thomas Cromwell , at the time the most powerful of the king 's advisors , brought forth the Solicitor General , Richard Rich , to testify that More had , in his presence , denied that the king was the legitimate head of the church . This testimony was almost certainly perjured ( witnesses Richard Southwell and Mr Palmer both denied having heard the details of the reported conversation ) , but on the strength of it the jury voted for More 's conviction",0

"how do I date a woman and make her feel confortable with me ? As to how you date , it depends on your culture . In the US , you ask her to go to dinner and a movie . Meet her parents , make polite conversation for 5 - 10 minutes , tell them when you will be home.Feeling comfortable is a matter of not pushing . Do n't try to [ hold hands / kiss / have sex ] on the first night , for instance , again depending on your culture . Ask her about her interests instead of talking about yours.Depending on your age and experience , she will probably be as nervous or not nervous as you . Two 16-year olds are ALWAYS nervous . A 40-year old divorced man and a 40-year old widow should be less nervous ; they have seen more of life .

"How did the advancing technology of weapons affect WWI ? The primary advances were the airplane , submarine , machine gun , tank , and posionous gas . The machine gun made the frontal assault very costly thus trenches were used to protect the soldiers . These trenches were also lived in , which produced rat infestation , constantly wet conditions , and poor sanitation . All of these will contribute to the spread of disease and trench foot which sometimes resulted in amputation and even death . To attack the machine guns the tank was developed and although early models were notoriously unreliable their use in the final months contributed to the Allied victory . Poison gas will kill , cripple , and blind thousands . Airplanes initially used only for scouting will later develop into fighters against other planes and bombers . This will lead to some of the best known participants of the war and the glory of being a pilot ( Red Baron , Rickenbaker ) . Finally the submarine will spread the war to innocents on passenger ships and slow commerce to England and from the United States . More importantly it was the German use of Unrestricted submarine Warfare ( along with the Zimmerman note ) that brought the US into the war . It was the infusion of large numbers of Americans with their aggressive fighting ability that will be the deciding factor in the Allied victory .",0

"How 's apoptosis related to the development of the fingers ? the way apoptosis make the fingers form ( scroll to `` > > > > > > '' ) For every cell , there is a time to live and a time to die . There are two ways in which cells die : They are killed by injurious agents . They are induced to commit suicide.Death by injuryCells that are damaged by injury , such as by mechanical damage exposure to toxic chemicalsundergo a characteristic series of changes : They ( and their organelles like mitochondria ) swell ( because the ability of the plasma membrane to control the passage of ions and water is disrupted ) . The cell contents leak out , leading to inflammation of surrounding tissues.Death by suicideCells that are induced to commit suicide : shrink ; develop bubble-like blebs on their surface ; have the chromatin ( DNA and protein ) in their nucleus degraded ; have their mitochondria break down with the release of cytochrome c ; break into small , membrane-wrapped , fragments . The phospholipid phosphatidylserine , which is normally hidden within the plasma membrane , is exposed on the surface . This is bound by receptors on phagocytic cells like macrophages and dendritic cells which then engulf the cell fragments . The phagocytic cells secrete cytokines that inhibit inflammation ( e.g. , IL-10 and TGF-β ) The pattern of events in death by suicide is so orderly that the process is often called programmed cell death or PCD . The cellular machinery of programmed cell death turns out to be as intrinsic to the cell as , say , mitosis . Programmed cell death is also called apoptosis.1 . Programmed cell death is as needed for proper development as mitosis is . Examples : The resorption of the tadpole tail at the time of its metamorphosis into a frog occurs by apoptosis . > > > > > > > > The formation of the fingers and toes of the fetus requires the removal , by apoptosis , of the tissue between them . The sloughing off of the inner lining of the uterus ( the endometrium ) at the start of menstruation occurs by apoptosis . The formation of the proper connections ( synapses ) between neurons in the brain requires that surplus cells be eliminated by apoptosis",0

"what is the use of an attenuator in electronic circuits ? does a single attenuator work the same with any load . please tell me how it works n principle involved . An attenuator is used to reduce the level of a signal . A single attenuator will not work the same with any load , because the input and output impedances of the attenuator should be matched to the characteristic impedances of the system in which it is used.One of the simplest forms of attenuator is a resistive T or pi network , which is basically just an electronic `` divider '' circuit . If you know the attenuator resistor and output impedance values , you just apply Ohm 's Law to calculate the input/output ratio .

"y do people smoke ? What I have heard or read is that smoking gives someone something to do with their hands . Also , people like to `` see '' the smoke and may not enjoy smoking in pitch darkness . Smoking may offer a distraction when someone is nervous calming them down .

Hollywood promotes smoking by making it look necessary or cool . Be your own judge , its your lungs .

"Why should things like language change just for the sake of new generations ? Case in point . Language may change for clarity and definition , such as the reason for thee , thou , thy and thine . Ok , you , your , and yours , which I still believe are acceptable for Worship , and religious expressions ; The Spanish Language uses that form for familiarity among personal relatives ; but did you know that the words `` blessed '' , `` doth '' `` knowest '' and `` thinketh '' can be related to a `` lisp tongue '' ie , . `` All I want for Chrithmath ith my two front teeth '' . Therefore a word like blessed would be pronouced `` Blethed '' and thinks `` thinkth '' or phonetically `` thinketh '' .My real point , however , is that most of todays language changes are perverse , gutteral , and obscene . As for traditions ; only the most valuable ones , based upon morality and righteousness , are becoming extinct.I ask you ; what do you say ? Language does n't change for the sake of a new generation . The change had already started generations before . Who came up with the obscenities in the first place ? Who decided that these sounds when put together to make words would be vulgar ? This is an interesting question . Your examples are interesting , also . I 'm not sure it is quite that simple . I 'm thinking that you would need a nation of people to lose their teeth permanently for at least a couple of generations for the new pronunciation to take effect .",0

"What is the temperature of an absolute vacuum ? No one can give me a good answer to this . i never really thought about it and so i was just going to say that temperature doesnt matter because its a vacuum and is dealing with the pressure ... but when i thought about it ... come to think of it , i do have an answer for you . the temperature would be zero kelvin , absolute zero . in an absolute vacuum , the pressure would be 0 if there were no particles , because the more particles you cram into one place , the more pressure there is because p=F/A pressure equals the force of the particles divided by the area of the wall of the container , so with no force of particles ( since there are no partiles ) , the pressure would be zero . in an absolute vacuum , there are no particles . Now , if the pressure is zero , then according to the formula PV=nRT ( which is just the ideal gas law formula , ) if P ( pressure ) equals 0 , i think that means that T ( temperature in Kelvin ) would also be 0 which would mean that the temperature would be at absolute zero ( which is defined as the temperature where all matter stops moving.. not that this would make a difference because there are no particles there because it 's an absolute vacuum . This is what i suspect and to confirm my beliefs , it is consistent with the fact that someone else said that outer space was 3K , and although it 's very close to an absolute vacuum , there are a few particles and atoms of gas floating around there , and so it is not quite an absolute vacuum , and the temperature is 3K , meaning it 's not quite at absolute zero . so it stands to reason that since temperature decreases when pressure decreases , that in an absolute vacuum the temperature would be absolute zero , 0 kelvin.i hope this is a `` good answer '' and that i made sense while i took you through my reasoning : )",0

"how can a helicopter hover while the earth is turning ? The first answer is correct .

And that is simply because the atmosphere is turning around with the heli , like the first answer stated.Just wanted to elaborate with another example . A fly takes off from the dashboard of a speeding car with its windows closed . Does the fly stay in air or , since the fly is now seperated from the car , does the car rush forward , making it seem like the fly is hurtled to the back of the car ? Even in this case , the air inside the car is being brought along with the car at the same speed . Therefore , the speed of the fly relative to the car will always be 0 .",0

My wife says it was just a crush and nothing physical . I 'm not sure this is the truth , since she lied about everything else , until I found out for myself . Lying is part of the Affair .

"A daughter marries a father and her mother marries his son . what 's the relationship between the offsping 's ? ? Wow , weird how many people jump to this being incest and going on about the DNA problems . There is no incest here people ! ! ! Mary Jones marries John smithMarys mom ( betty ) marries John smiths Son ( paul ) No blood ties there at all between the two different sexual unions . The only relationship is through marriage.If both couples have a girl ( for ease lets say sally and jane ) then I think that would make them each others cousin , niece and aunt.Sally would be pauls sister and so the aunt to any offspring of pauls . This also makes any offspring of her brother pauls her niece or nephew ( obviously ) . Jane is marys sister and so the same is true , she will be aunt to any of marys offspring hence we have the relationship Aunt and niece for both children to each other . They are also however the grandchildren of each couple . Jane is the grandchild of Mary and John and sally is the grandchild of Betty and paul and since the only relationship I can think of between grandchildren normally is cousins I think this term applies here as well .",0

"What is a good start for a man over 40 , weight traning and cardio plan ? I am in fairly good shape . Matt , I would recommend that you start with a check-up with your doctor , just to make sure you are in otherwise good shape . Having done this you are good to go . Although not widely known , weight lifters normally have better cardio systems than runners , just not the lung capacity . At 40 , I would recommend starting with a moderate weight lifting routine on machines . Later you can switch to free weights as you get stronger . Free weights are better in some respect in that you have to control the weights . However , most modern machine weights are designed to give you a workout throughout the complete range of motion . Make sure you get plenty of rest between reps and do n't over do it to start with . Also add moderate stretching and decent nutrition . You do n't have to give up all good foods , because as you add muscle your body will consume more calories , even at rest . Sometimes the muscle aches caused by the minor tears in the muscle during working out do n't appear for 48 hours . The tears rebuild and realign into stronger muscle tissue . Take your time . Normally about 3 weeks of moderate weight lifting will begin to show results . A little weight gain can be expected if you are n't also dieting , but the weight gain does not mean size gain . Muscle is denser , so a pound of muscle is not as big as a pound of fat . Good luck ole boy and welcome to the over 40 club . By the way . Since I turned 40 I have dated women ranging in age from 19 to 56 , so if you are n't married , it 's a whole new world out there .",0

"Im keeping a food diary to control my food intake , as I have to drop about 30 pounds . Does it really work ? Experts say writing down your eating habits will keep your diet on track -- even when you slip up and eat a few things you wish you hadn't.Food journals can help keep portions under control . For example , do n't just write that you ate chicken for dinner . Write down how many ounces that piece of chicken was . And how many pieces you consumed . Information on gauging portions can be found on the Internet . If you are not seeing a dietician , you can cross-check your daily food intake with the USFDA food guide pyramid . The Food and Nutrition Information Center Web site provides a USFDA food guide pyramid at www.nalusda.gov/fnic/index.html . The Web site includes USFDA food pyramids for ethnic foods as well.Wondering if you 've eat enough servings of fruit and vegetables ? A food journal can help you figure it out . While it 's not helpful to everyone , many people report food journal success.No matter what you 're weight loss or eating goal , scribbling your snacking habits down is a good idea , experts say .

The bird flu is n't really dangerous now , but it has potential to become a serious threat . The main problem with bird flu is its high resistance to antibiotics . And everytime one of those few people with it are treated , there is the chance that new strains resistant to that treatment will develop . The main difference between bird flu and malaria is that we generally have malaria isolated in africa , with few exceptions , where as we dont really know how far bird flu has spread . There 's also vaccines to prevent malaria and drugs to treat it.Also , bird flu hits and kills a person very fast.. typically wthin 3-4 days .

"how to seek a ideal job ? I would say the first thing to do is identify what you consider ideal and perhaps write it down . With those qualities in mind you can begin to think seriously about who you would want to work for , where you would want to work and what kind of work you would want to do . As you are thinking about that , take a look at your resume / cv . Does your knowledge , skills , experiences and education align you with your perfect job or do you need additional skills and training to help make you more marketable . If there are gaps , now is the time to address them.With that accomplished , you can set out with your list of qualities and your resume to find your perfect job . I suggest the best approach to this facet of your job search is to use a mixed approach . You can put your resume on the boards , but my experience has proven that it is n't the most effecient or effective way to find a job . Additionally , scour the job boards ( Monster.com , Hotjobs . com , Careerbuilder.com and any niche sites that you may know of or be a member of ) and identify jobs that you would want to apply for . Make sure that you are not kidding yourself or overestimating your abilities.While all of this is going on get the word out , talk to everyone you know and let them know that you are on the market and what kind of work you are looking for . Networking is one of the most effective ways to find a job.This is n't an exhaustive step-by-step guide , but it should help you get started . All of this advice comes from a number of years of experience as a recruiter for large corporations .",0

And in the interest of education , do n't laugh when you hear some ... familiar words.There is a process in which it is done . The mature egg in the woman 's vagina is met with the mature sperm in the man 's testicles through intercourse . This is called fertilization . As soon as the egg is fertile , it becomes known as a zygote . The zygote is then transported to the womb , an organ in the female reproduction system that can expand to the size of a basketball , if the circumstances permit it to . The egg sticks to the side of the womb and grows , multiplying in cell count , fron 1 to 2 , to 4 , to 8 , and et cetra , for the first four months , also called the first Trimester . then it is called an Embyro . for the next trimester , the embyro will assume human characteristics , like arms and legs , and the heart will start beating . For the final trimester , the baby will gain muscle mass and fatty tissue , the tissue that will protect the new baby from harmful impact and harsh weather . After the final trimester , the baby can be given birth via vaginal birth , where the baby comes through the vagina of the mother ( a process that is , indeed , very painful ) , or Cisarean section , also known as C-section , where the mother is surgically cut open to remove the baby ( do n't worry , the doctors put her back together ) . The baby is then taken to a maternity ward for 3 days , so it can get used to the air and oxygen ( 12 months in water does make for a environmental shock ! ) . Then the mother is able to take home the baby , her new son or daughter .",0

"Are there any tried and true ways to stop psoriasis flare ups ? Keep your skin moist and lubricated . Avoid cold , dry climates . Cold weather may worsen symptoms , while hot , humid weather and sunlight may improve symptoms . ( However , hot humid weather may worsen certain types of psoriasis . ) Avoid scratching and picking skin and skin injuries ( cuts or scrapes ) . An injury to the skin can cause psoriasis patches to form anywhere on the body , including the site of the injury . This includes injuries to your nails or nearby skin while trimming your nails . Avoid stress and anxiety . Stress may cause psoriasis to appear suddenly ( flare ) or can make symptoms worse , although this has not been proven in studies . Avoid infection . Infections such as strep throat can cause psoriasis to appear suddenly ( called guttate psoriasis ) , especially in children . Try to avoid certain medications . Some , including beta-blockers and lithium , have been found to worsen psoriasis symptoms . Tell your doctor you have psoriasis before any medications are prescribed for you . Limit alcohol . This may help control psoriasis , especially for men .",0

"Did the Broncos lose or did the Steelers just win ? That 's always a tough question . Did the Broncos just not show up or was it the Steeler 's amazing play that shut 'em down ? My take : while the Steelers did play extremely well , the Broncos failed in every aspect of the game . Aside from Bailey and occasional glimpses of Lynch , I did n't see a single Broncos player play well . Here are my top reasons why the Broncos lost on Sunday : # 1 reason : Jake Plummer . with two fumbles and two interceptions , he totally folded . Tough to overome that many turnovers . # 2 - defense . the Broncos could n't stop the Steelers ' running OR passing game # 3 - special teams . terrible by the Broncos .

"Is it ever okay to get a divorce in the eyes of God ? What if you married an aethiest or an agnostic ? What if your husband beats you to a pulp continuously ... and there are kids involved ? What if your husband is cheating on you ... and wo n't stop ? Are you just supposed to stick it out because of the vows you took ? ( This really is n't a personal experience question so I do n't need advice on how to go to a woman 's shelter or anything ) . Although I am answering from a Catholic perspective , the theology is fairly universal.Jesus forbade divorce , except in cases of adultery . However , a divorce also implies that there was a marriage . This tends to be the angle that the Catholic church approaches the breakdown of a legal marriage , and that is , `` was it even a marriage ? `` Marriage is , as Jesus puts it , `` when two become one flesh '' , people whom God himself has `` joined together . '' A sacramental moment of that magnitude requires that people enter it with full consent , and that consent requires both the personal maturity to give that consent as well as having all the information needed to make that consent . Take abuse , for instance - abuse implies a kind of marital fraud . Nobody would knowingly start dating someone who they knew was going to beat them , right ? An abusive person is always going to put their best foot forward at first and hide that aspect of themselves until a time when they feel safe to let it out . This is a fraud - and if a person marries such a person , they are n't doing it with that full consent of the will necessary for a marriage to truly exist.So a civil divorce may not always be a wrong thing to do , if it really is more of an annulment of a marriage that never truly was.Also - the other thing to keep in mind , is that what Jesus specifically condemned was divorce and remarriage , not divorce alone . So even if the marriage was valid in the eyes of God - i.e . abuse , lies , fraud , alcoholism were n't part of the breakdown , it was a valid marriage - it is only remarriage that he 's actually condemned.An aside : marriage was not created by the state . It long predates the state . Marriage was deeded to the state by religion ...",0

"A child is suffereing from cardiac myopathy and she is given 24 hours medicne injected ( connected to machine ) D Doctors suggest she can live only with support of medicines . Is that true . Is there any other solution . she is only 1 year old . So surgery is not possible.Is there any cure for such patients how long they can survive , can they live without medicine . plesase advice Cardiomyopathy is a chronic and sometimes progressive disease in which the heart muscle ( myocardium ) , is abnormally enlarged , thickened and/or stiffened . The condition typically begins in the walls of the heart 's lower chambers ( ventricles ) , and in more severe cases also affects the walls of the upper chambers ( atria ) . The actual muscle cells as well as the surrounding tissues of the heart become damaged . Eventually , the weakened heart loses the ability to pump blood effectively and heart failure or irregular heartbeats ( arrhythmias or dysrhythmia ) may occur . The medication that she is being given is probably being used to help the heart contract or function better . The medication being given by machine is just to make sure it is n't given too quickly because of how small your child is.It is likely she will need some sort of medication the rest of her life . If she is a candidate for a heart transplant , she will still need to be on some sort of medication the rest of her life.You need to speak to your daughters Pediatrian or Cardiac Doctor if you have questions .

"What are the pros and cons of Nuclear thermal propulsion ? Is it feasible to use it in a manned mission to moon ? How is it better than nuclear electric propulsion ? What will be its harmful effects ? Will it violate the NTBT ? Project Orion was an idea in the 1960s to use nuclear explosions to push a space ship around the solar system . The idea was to use a lot of small explosions in succession to create the sort of effect one gets with a continious burn from the usual chemical fueled rockets.There were some small scale tests done with non-nuclear nukes , which suggested the concept was n't crazy , but there was never any full scale tests , and certainly nothing using fission bombs.It is not clear that scaling this concept up to the size needed for a manned rocket would be that feasible , although some disagree with that assesment . There would be a tremendous stress on the vehicle from all these explosions , especially if they were more contained ( in order to harness more of the explosive power for thrust ) .But , I do n't think we 'll ever see anything like this unless there is some sort of mass evacuation of the planet . ( Not there is anywhere to go . ) As you might expect , a Project Orion rocket is essentially the same as a huge number of atmospheric atomic explosions . Not exactly enviro-friendly , to say the least.IF by `` nuclear thermal '' propulsion you mean the generators used by some space probes to generate electricity , then these are far to weak for a manned vehicle . They could n't supply the power to lift off from Earth , and a trip to the moon using an electric ion drive takes much , much longer than the more direct chemically driven Apollo trajectory . Ion propulsion has tried on the space probe Deep Space 1 , although this was not nuclear powered .",0

"Why is the sky blue ? Light is a kind of energy that can travel through space . Light from the sun or a light bulb looks white , but it is really a mixture of many colors . The colors in white light are red , orange , yellow , green , blue and violet . You can see these colors when you look at a rainbow in the sky.Rainbow PictureThe sky is filled with air . Air is a mixture of tiny gas molecules and small bits of solid stuff , like dust.As sunlight goes through the air , it bumps into the molecules and dust . When light hits a gas molecule , it may bounce off in a different direction . Some colors of light , like red and orange , pass straight through the air . But most of the blue light bounces off in all directions . In this way , the blue light gets scattered all around the sky.When you look up , some of this blue light reaches your eyes from all over the sky . Since you see blue light from everywhere overhead , the sky looks blue .",0

"Ice to Steam ? Calculate the amount of heat ( in kJ ) needed to change 59.90 g ice at -17.87 oC to steam at 250.7 oC . ( Some constants for H2O : Heat of fusion : 333 J/g ; Heat of vaporization : 2260 J/g ; Specific heats : Ice : 2.1 J/g.K , Water : 4.2 J/g.K , Steam : 2.0 J/g.K ) Note : I 'm going to convert all the intermediate steps into kJ by dividing by 1000 . I wo n't show that step . First , let 's find out how much heat it 'll take to get the ice from -17.87 degrees to zero degrees , where it has to be in order to melt . This is a change of 17.87 degrees . ( Because one degree Celsius and one Kelvin is the same size degree , they are interchangable . ) We 'll use the specific heat capacity of ice . 59.90 g ice * ( 2.1 J/g*K ) * ( 17.87 K ) =2248 J = 2.248 kJNext , let 's find out how much energy it would take to melt that ice at 0 degrees to water at 0 degrees using the heat of fusion:59.90 g ice * ( 333 J/g ) =19950 J = 19.95 kJNext , let 's find out how much energy it would take to get the water from 0 to 100 degrees ( so it can become steam ) using the specific heat of water:59.90 g water * ( 4.2 J/g*K ) * ( 100 . K ) =25160 J = 25.16 kJNext , let 's find out how much energy it would take to evaporate the water using the heat of vaporization : 59.90 g water* ( 2260 J/g ) =135400J = 135.4 kJFinally , let 's find out how much energy it would take to get the steam from 100 to 250.7 degrees for a total change of 150.7 ; we will use the specific heat capacity of steam:59.90 g steam* ( 2.0 J/g*K ) * ( 150.7 K ) =18050 J= 18.05 kJ . Now , just add up all of the heats required at each of these steps : 2.248 kJ+19.95 kJ+25.16 kJ+135.4 kJ+18.05 kJ=200.8 kJ , with correct significant figures .",0

"How does one approach a total jerk coach who is mean , unsensitve and hurtful to my daughter ? She is 16 and loves basket - but the coach ( who is the head of the association unfortunately ) is a horrible person . She refuses to quit the team but is terribly unhappy , sometimes cries , does n't want to talk about it in detail and does n't want us to talk to him . I wish she would quit but she refuses . I see her terribly upset - what can we do ? She thinks she can continue suffering , but I think he tries to get her to quit . A total unsensitive ... ... .. ! Well ... getting too involved will embarass your daughter and possibly even make it harder for her to stay on the team , which she obviously wants . Kudos to her for sticking withit even when it upsets her ! Make your presence known to the coach but dont try to confront him or tell him what to do . I am a swimming coach , and when a parent goes out of their way to thank me or let me know they appreciate what I am doing , then I am more positive to the kids as a whole . Try being ridiculously nice to the jerk . Come a little early to a practice one day and watch the end , and then when all the girls go to the locker rooms walk up to the coach , introduce yourself , and tell him that the kids seem to be doing such a wonderful job and that you are so pleased with the progress they are all making . Making yourself as NICE as possible will make it harder for him to be mean to your daughter.Then , tell your daughter how proud of her you are for sticking with it even when its hard for her . This is a big deal for someone so young , and it says a lot about her character . Good luck !",0

"Which comes first : thunder or lightning ? Look , lightning and thunder HAPPEN at the same time . Lightning causes the air to displace and when it contracts again ( immediately ) you get thunder , the sound of air filling a gap . You see lightning first because it is traveling @ 180,000 mps , thunder travels at the speed of sound ( depends on where you live ) . You can generally determine how far away you are from the place of origin by counting 1 one-hundred , 2 one hundred , etc until you hear thunder and divide that number by two . That is how many miles away you are.BTW , if you see lightning and hear thunder at the same time , the event is right where you are !",0

How to become a good teacher in English ? I am from China and I am going to be a teacher of English there . So I want to get some good suggestion on how to be a good teacher of English . First be yourself and do not be intemidated by your students . You can be a good teacher and still feel extremely comfortable with your students as well as your students being the same.Get them interested and do not assume that a student is too stupid to learn . Always be there for your students and have assistants to help.Reading material is great . Ask students for what they got out of the reading material . There should be no wrong answer.Make things fun . You are the teacher . Teach and enjoy,0
"need some advice ? This is my situation . iam a single parent of three kids , work , and have a bachlors degree . right now iam living with my parents . i have a boyfriend for 3 years and i want to move out of my moms and live with him . he told me when i finshed school and found a good job he was ready to move in with me . march of last year , he lived in a 3 bedroom apt . his roomates moved out and he asked me and my kids to move in . i lived with him 3 weeks until the owner of the building told me i cant live in this apt becuase it was a basement and it was legal to live there with three kids . i moved back to my moms and have been here now at least a year . he tells me to wait 1,2 months and we will move in together again . i have been waiting and still the same excuse . i love him and want to be with him and he is supportive and cares about my children . i have been saving money and iam ready to move out with my kids in my own place.he tells me to wait 1 or 2 months . dont know what to do . You do n't mention your age , but you have 3 children and have a BA . I assume you have some intelligence . Love is a tricky thing . I say , get your own place - think about the kids . Your only job in life right now is to ensure the children are raised to be healthy , well-adjusted children . How much good are you to them if you are constantly wondering about this man ? Learn to love yourself fully and make that enough to sustain you . Love those kids and provide for them . The rest will fall into place . Your children will learn from you . If your child was in your situation , what would you want them to do ? God Bless . I hope you figure it out .",0

"Pro-lifers , answer me this ... ? Without getting all passionate and calling out God 's name , can you explain in calm tones and with facts , why pro-lifers think that they have the right to demand that other women follow their beliefs and not have abortions ? Consider this:1 . If you believe that abortion is morally wrong , and someone else disagrees , why is it okay for you to insist that they share your views ? After all , Hindus think its wrong to eat cows , and i 've met pro-lifers who enjoy burgers . Isnt a difference in morals normal ? 2 . if you are so against abortion , would you adopt a woman 's child if she cancelled her procedure ? would you adopt EVERY SINGLE CHILD that would otherwise be aborted ? and if not , does n't that make you a hypocrite ? 3 . Many pro-choicers are n't pro-abortion and would not have one themselves . They believe in the right of a woman to have a choice . What do you base your right to force your ideals onto others on ? ( and please , do n't say religion . What if the woman is an atheist ? ) I am not a pro-lifer but the way I see it - which could be wrong - without repeating what others said is that you can not kill a soul.I believe in reincarnation . OK ... .once born : different question and a dilemna.But on the whole : is an unwanted child better ? I do n't think so at all . What if people were forced to adopt a child they did not want ? Life for everyone would be very miserable.And to those out there : sometimes girls need to hide the fact from the family so putting up for adoption is out of question . The family would resent it a lot and force the girl to have and keep the child.Children should be wanted and loved . If that is not the case , better have an abortion rather than raise an unfit , miserable human being .",0

But I do n't think so its enough..I am looking for something exotic..no birds..and something which is 'legal ' in the US . I always wanted a leopard ! ! I 'm particularly fond of reptiles . Snakes in particular , I like the large breeds . However , it is an awesome responsibility to take on many types of exotic pets . They require considerable financial and time investiments on your part . Just being `` crazy about animals '' is NO where near enough . You MUST be willing to take on the very special needs of the pet . My Red Tailed Boa , for example , is considered a `` giant snake '' . She will likely reach 10 foot long ( she is already 8 1/2 or so ) and eats two `` collossal sized '' rats every 10 days or so . Her cage is 2'X 2'X 8 ' on a 3 ' tall cabinet . Its roughly 300 gallons and is simply adequate for her size at this point . Her humidity and heat have to be maintained very precisely . The cage and all the environmental parts and necessities to maintain her in a healthy tropical space is about a $ 3000 investment ( she only cost $ 80 ) . If you have the means and the interest in such an animal , I do have some excellent designs for a humidification system that will manage a vented cage of this size.Here is a link to some specialty cages.http : //www.cagesbydesign.com/and here is the humidification system and some pictures of Pandora at home : http : //www.osagecollies.com/humid",0
"What is Trans Fat ? How to reduce that ? I heard that tras fat is bad for the body . Why is that ? Where can we find it in our daily food ? Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation , when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil . The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat , which raises `` bad '' LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease . Until very recently , food labels were not required to list trans fats , and this health risk remained hidden to consumers . In early July , FDA regulations changed , and food labels will soon begin identifying trans fat content in processed foods .",0

"sbc offers different price rates for dsl . what is the best if my son will be playing x box live ? is there different speeds with different pricing ? with what we have now he 's playing people that have cable dsl and he keeps getting booted off Xbox Live is just like any online game . The biggest issue you will ever see has to do with Latency , also known as `` Lag '' . Latency occurs when there are bottlenecks in the general network layout . Think LA freeways at 5pm on a Friday night . Unfortunately this issue is not one you can change , because it has to do with the actual design of the network , so choosing your provider properly is essential.Cable Internet , in its basic form , is a shared medium . This means that every person who subscribes to Cable in your neighborhood shares the same on-ramp to the internet . This is only a problem if there are large numbers of concurrent users in your area.DSL , on the other hand , connects you to the backbone in a more efficient , seperated manner . This has the advantage of being much less susceptible to latency . Unfortunately , this advantage goes down the farther away from the switching office ( CO ) you are . Another thing to consider is newer Cable networks tend to use a different model of communications than the old ones , and so approach DSL levels of service.To sum up : DSL is better than Cable , but tends to be slower . However any speed higher than about 1 meg / sec should be MORE than sufficient to run today 's games .",0

When you 've decided you 're in a relationship , you 'll probably start referring to one another as boyfriend/girlfriend . You 'll introduce each other to your close friends and family . You 'll likely spend a LOT of time together , and may take it for granted that you 'll see each other certain nights and weekends . Depending on your lifestyle , you may agree to make your relationship exclusive and stop seeing other people.If you 're uncomfortable discussing taking things to `` the next level '' you 're probably just dating , and not quite ready for a relationship .",0

Active Euthanasia : a positive action is taken to bring about someone ’ s death e.g . the administering of a deadly injection or the assisting in preparations for a suicide2 . Passive Euthanasia involves a refusal to intervene to change the course of events , where the result is the death of the person.All of these countries support Assisted Euthanasia -a second party ( usually a physician ) participates in bringing about the patient ’ s death , but is not the sole cause of the death . Netherland for example allows permits physician assisted dying when each of the following conditions is fulfilled : the patient 's suffering is unbearable with no prospect of improvement the patient 's request for euthanasia must be voluntary and persist over time ( The request can not be granded when under the influence of others , psychological illness or drugs ) the patient must be fully aware of his/her condition , prospects and options there must be consultation with at least one other independent docter who needs to confirm the conditions mentioned above the death must be carried out in a medically appropriate fashion by the doctor or patient , in which case the doctor must be present . the patient is at least 12 years old ( patients between 12 and 16 years of age require the consent of their parents ) these laws are different in each of these countries .",0

"Should NiCADS get hot when they are in use ? ( NOT WHEN CHARGING ) ? When using a Modified 6V nicad ( use to be 4.8V ) it becomes very hot..probly about +70C . the system it drives is designed to automatically shut down when supply voltage drops ( Unsure what to ) reciently tested and found the drop from the 6V was as followsFully Charged = 7.55VShut down voltage = 5.89VHowever i have not modified the system in which it is used for so how is it that it is shutting down before the standard nicad voltage of 4.8V ? Have placed the Nicad in the freezer to see if dropping the temperature will allow me to re use the nicad in the system . Please help electronics ar n't my thing NiCads in general electronic applications are typically designed to NOT get hot , since the heat destroys the NiCad battery , can damage electronics and causes lawsuits when users get burned from the hot battery . Some devices like radio-controlled cars are high-drain applications that generate a lot of heat , so the batteries for these devices are designed for their specific use.Batteries get hot when they charge due to the high current going into them . The faster they charge , typically the hotter they get . When the battery discharges during use , the same thing happens , the battery gets hotter as more current is drawn from the battery . Without knowing anything else , my guess is that high current draw from the battery cells is causing them to heat up . This can be due to a defective battery , a battery not designed for the way you are using it or your modification damaged the battery or is otherwise causing excessive current drain.Also , increasing the supply voltage can drive more current through the device , so it may just be that the higher voltage is drawing more current.I ’ m not sure how the device is shutting down , so I can ’ t say why it ’ s doing that . Note that the voltage at which a device stops working is the voltage seen by the device itself . If you remove the battery from the device and measure the voltage , you will get a different voltage than if you measure the voltage at the precise moment the device shuts down . This is especially true for high current drain applications , which appears to be what ’ s happening with your batteries . Placing the NiCad ’ s in the freezer wo n't help . They ’ ll have to warm up to work properly anyway .",0

"who will allocate memory for Objects in Java ? Will the memory be allocated before compilation ? That depends on how you run your Java programs . Since you say `` compilation '' , I assume you 're actually building them into executable form.Memory is allocated in real-time , that is , when an object is instantiated , that is when the memory is allocated by the system . Say you have an object that is created only after you enter your name . When the program starts , the object is not in memory . Once you enter your name , the object will create , and the system will allocate the necessary memory.Remember that with Java , when you `` delete '' an object , it does n't always fall immediately out of the memory stack . The Garbage Collection routine will occasionally filter through and `` de-allocate '' all those homeless memory pointers .",0

"Can you give me a overview of Memoirs of Geisha ? From Library Journal '' I was n't born and raised to be a Kyoto geisha ... .I 'm a fisherman 's daughter from a little town called Yoroido on the Sea of Japan . '' How nine-year-old Chiyo , sold with her sister into slavery by their father after their mother 's death , becomes Sayuri , the beautiful geisha accomplished in the art of entertaining men , is the focus of this fascinating first novel . Narrating her life story from her elegant suite in the Waldorf Astoria , Sayuri tells of her traumatic arrival at the Nitta okiya ( a geisha house ) , where she endures harsh treatment from Granny and Mother , the greedy owners , and from Hatsumomo , the sadistically cruel head geisha . But Sayuri 's chance meeting with the Chairman , who shows her kindness , makes her determined to become a geisha . Under the tutelage of the renowned Mameha , she becomes a leading geisha of the 1930s and 1940s . After the book 's compelling first half , the second half is a bit flat and overlong . Still , Golden , with degrees in Japanese art and history , has brilliantly revealed the culture and traditions of an exotic world , closed to most Westerners . Highly recommended.- ? Wilda Williams , `` Library Journal '' According to Arthur Golden 's absorbing first novel , the word `` geisha '' does not mean `` prostitute , '' as Westerners ignorantly assume -- it means `` artisan '' or `` artist . '' To capture the geisha experience in the art of fiction , Golden trained as long and hard as any geisha who must master the arts of music , dance , clever conversation , crafty battle with rival beauties , and cunning seduction of wealthy patrons . After earning degrees in Japanese art and history from Harvard and Columbia -- and an M.A . in English -- he met a man in Tokyo who was the illegitimate offspring of a renowned businessman and a geisha . This meeting inspired Golden to spend 10 years researching every detail of geisha culture , chiefly relying on the geisha Mineko Iwasaki , who spent years charming the very rich and famous.The result is a novel with the broad social canvas ( and love of coincidence ) of Charles Dickens and Jane Austen 's intense attention to the nuances of erotic maneuvering . Readers experience the entire life of a geisha , from her origins as an orphaned fishing-village girl in 1929 to her triumphant auction of her mizuage ( virginity ) for a record price as a teenager to her reminiscent old age as the distinguished mistress of the powerful patron of her dreams . We discover that a geisha is more analogous to a Western `` trophy wife '' than to a prostitute -- and , as in Austen , flat-out prostitution and early death is a woman 's alternative to the repressive , arcane system of courtship . In simple , elegant prose , Golden puts us right in the tearoom with the geisha ; we are there as she gracefully fights for her life in a social situation where careers are made or destroyed by a witticism , a too-revealing ( or not revealing enough ) glimpse of flesh under the kimono , or a vicious rumor spread by a rival `` as cruel as a spider . '' Golden 's web is finely woven , but his book has a serious flaw : the geisha 's true romance rings hollow -- the love of her life is a symbol , not a character . Her villainous geisha nemesis is sharply drawn , but she would be more so if we got a deeper peek into the cause of her motiveless malignity -- the plight all geisha share . Still , Golden has won the triple crown of fiction : he has created a plausible female protagonist in a vivid , now-vanished world , and he gloriously captures Japanese culture by expressing his thoughts in authentic Eastern metaphors.Amazon",0

"Is there a safe way to invest in a work from home project ? how can you tell it is not a scam ? Work from home is a dream for lots of people because it is convenient and you can be your own boss , but the problem is how do you know that what you are about to invest in is the real deal or just a scam ? The fact that you use the word `` invest '' in the same sentence as `` work from home '' is a danger flag ! Never send anyone you do n't know any money for any such scheme ! How do you know if it 's a scam ? Easy ! It 's always a scam ! ! Here 's what consumer advocate and expert Clark Howard says about the subject : '' The bottom line is that you make money doing something you already know how to do . You set up a business by making phone calls , networking and getting your name out , often times using your current or past employers . Paying money up front should never occur ! If they tell you to pay $ 30 or $ 60 for all of the supplies , it 's likely you wo n't get anything but some more ads from the company . You get into the system with an employer first and then you work up to working from home – not the other way around . You find work the same way you would if you were interviewing for a work-in-the-office job . There are skills you have that you may be able to use in an entrepreneurial fashion from home . You can save a lot of money starting a business from home . So , think about that instead of thinking it will all be provided for you in a kit . ''",0

The more muscle your have the more calories you burn so you MUST have breakfast after your morning workout.So keep doing your cardio ON AN EMPTY STOMACH but be sure to have at the minimul a protien shake once your are done . Plus , as the other guy mentioned eating every few hours increases your motabolism keeping your internal furnace running on high .",0

For some reason , they do n't make your teeth as sensitive during the whitening process.One thing that you have to keep in mind is that you have to find the time to use the product . You have to keep the strips on for 30 minutes at a time , twice a day . I usually did this before I went to work in the morning , and after I got home , before I went out again . But it 's kindof hard to commit to if you have a really busy schedule.My uncle is an orthodontist and told me that if you have really sensitive teeth , Crest White Strips are still safe to use . Just because they cause pain does n't mean they 're harming you , they 're just making your teeth sensitive during the whitening process.Happy smiles !",0

"Should I start my kids ( 5 and 8 years old ) on skiing or snowboarding first ? I want them to learn both ? I would say skiing , and here is why : The first day out , you want your kids to have a good time . If they get a bad first impression , you could be in for fifteen years of boring vacations sitting on beaches or whatever non-skiers/boarders do on vacations . Anyne will tell you that the first day on a board you spend it on your rear end . I had big purple welts the first time . With skiing , you fall a little bit , but with separate feet you are at least standing most of the time . Secondly , when skiing , you gradually progress over many years to become an avid skier . With snowboarding , you either can snowboard or you ca n't . The kids will want to learn to snowboard , despite the bad first day , once they are into the whole winter sports thing . So use skiing to get them to have a good time , then , once they are parallel skiing , let them snowboard . about 18 years ago , when me and my brother were beginners , he switched to snowboarding . I waited another couple years . Now I do both expertly , and the one time he tried skiing , he broke his leg trying to keep up with me . He never mastered skiing because he could n't appreciate the slower learning process of the sport . kids are impatient . If they have a bad first ten minutes they want to go home . If it is too much work to learn something similar to something they are already good at , they wo n't learn it . good luck .",0

"When God created the world , He made one . Why then are our skins different & We marry when we should be sibbling There was a time when people were hunter-gatherers and lived a nomadic lifestyle . Because of this , the population spread throughout the world . Over time , peoples ' skin colors changed to adapt to the amount and intensity of the sun where they lived . For example , people closer to the equator developed darker skin because they got a lot of sunlight and people closer to the poles developed lighter skin because they got a lot less sunlight . That 's why people have different skin colors . Why do people marry when we are really all distant relatives ? Well , if the Biblical accounts are to be accepted , the simple truth is that we do marry our far-distant relatives .

It is not uncommon in that area of the country , and is allowed by law , for second cousins to marry .",0

"Could inteligent life have evolved from a different animal group , such as reptiles , birds or even insects ? Does higher intelligence ( such as humans have ) require some quality that only mammals have ? The fact that female mammals produce milk for their young means that at birth a mammal can have a relatively large brain , although they are relatively helpless . Other animals have to be able to at least get around.Brains do n't grow as much as other parts of the body , which is why babies seem to have large heads.The obvious counter-example is birds , where the young are stuck in the nest and depend on their parents for food . However , flight puts a limit on how heavy a bird can be , and so how heavy its brain can be . But flightless birds are a possible candidate.Amphibians and reptiles are cold-blooded , which seems as though it would rule out our sort of intelligence . On the other hand , perhaps an intelligent crocodile would think of slowing down when the temperature drops much as we think of sleep . Remember that a large brain would mean a large egg ( and you have to fit the rest of the body inside the egg as well ) .",0

"Why do people have five fingers instead of six or seven ? Richard Dawkins attempts to answer this : [ The embryo of every 4-limbed vertebrate has five `` fingers and toes '' . ] '' We tend to think that the possession of 5 digits is deeply stamped in the hands and feet of tetrapods ( 4-limbed vertebrates ) . Yet { some early vertebrates ] had 7 toes ... .8 toes ... .6 toes . ... My tentative guess is thatin those early times the different species really did benefit from their respective numbers of toes ... Later the tetrapod limb design hardened at 5 digits because some internal embryonic process came to rely upon that number . In the adult the number is frequently reduced ... in..modern horses to just one , the middle toe . ''",0

I hope you guys can help ! ! ! Thanks again . Also if you could give me a crash course on computer specifications and what exactly they mean . ( gigahertz , pentium , celeron ) what is all that a measurement of , and how should it affect me when i go to buy my notebook . What should i be looking for . I 'll be using the notebook for internet and typing papers . Thanks guys ! ! ! I work on an HP Compaq NC6000 that work supplied me and I like it . I 've had it over a year . It 's been reliable and fast . My wife has owned a Toshiba for over three years.I surf the internet , play music on it , write technical papers , send e-mails , write programs , and run numerical analyses on it.Battery life could be better . I can only go for about an hour and a half before the battery depletes.If you are going to be taking notes in classes , you may want to get two batteries for it so you can get several hours of uptime without connecting to a power supply.The rest of it ... Gigahertz , Pentium , Celeron , AMD really does n't matter these days . Almost any laptop will play DVDs ( with a DVD player ) , CDs , etc plenty fast.In fact , the lower the Gigahertz ( the clock rate which at which the processor ( AMD or Intel ) ticks along ) , the longer your batter life may be . Slowest Gigahertz you should go with is about 1.5GHz.I would make sure that the notebook has at least 512MB of memory , preferably 1GB . This is important if you run several programs at once ( e-mail , internet , music player , and word processor ) . If you do n't , things can slow down and wear down battery life faster as data is moved on and off disk.I would go with a 15 '' LCD . 17 '' is better if you are at your desk all the time , but if you are carrying the thing around a lot , the smaller display makes for a more compact laptop . To each his own.Any brand-name laptop ( HP , Dell , IBM , Toshiba ) should do well to meet your requirements .",0

"um..i got ta queston ? does anyone know of any kind of product , thats not that expensive for acne . Because i 've tried several different things , but they do n't want to seem to work . Okay 1. what causes acne ? 2.what should I use to clear it ? hormonesFor most people with acne , it begins at puberty . This is when the body starts to produce hormones called androgens . Androgens cause the enlargement and overstimulation of the sebaceous glands in people with acne . Sensitivity to these androgens also cause acne to appear during the menstrual cycle and sometimes in pregnancy . The extra sebum ( oil ) that the sebaceous glands produce mixes with dead skin cells and bacteria on the skin 's surface and this blocks pores . Inside the blocked pore , bacteria multiply and cause inflammation leading to the spots and pustules associated with acne.stressStress can also cause the production of hormones , such as cortisol , which can aggravate acne.other causes * Acne is often genetic * Some medications and steroids * Heavy or oily make up * Over abrasive cleansing o Astringent facial products can dry the skin out causing the body to create even more sebum to compensate o Use of harsh exfoliators can damage existing spots and spread infection o Picking or squeezing of blackheads , whiteheads and spots can send the infection deeper into the skin and cause scarring * A diet high in foods that can aggravate acneou really can get rid of acne , naturally . How ? By learning about the causes of acne and how to rebalance the body . By understanding that applying harsh chemicals to the skin can actually exacerbate the skin 's natural oil production and make acne worse . Why is it that people who do n't eat a Western diet do n't have acne ? You , too , can get rid of acne by understanding why it 's predominantly a Western problem . In parts of the world where a Western diet is being adopted , they are now getting acne.Our bodies are fine-tuned machines , continually creating new cells and getting rid of dead cells . There are three processes vital to human health ; appropriation ( taking in food , air , water etc ) , assimilation ( absorbing nutrients to create new cells ) and elimination ( expelling waste/toxins ) . If any one of these is unbalanced , this can lead to less than vital health . We need to take in the right fuel , use it effectively and get rid of by-products and waste . For example , we get rid of waste via the digestive system , the lungs and the skin ; if the digestive system is sluggish waste may have to be expelled via the skin as blocked pores and acne .",0

"How do you make a USB drive bootable ? I have a Sony Micro Vault 256MB HDD ( the stick kind that plugs into the USB port ) I want to make this bootable so I can use it to dump pre-built images using ghost . I need to know how to get it to format with the system info so I can boot directly from the device . Your BIOS must support booting from USB devices . On system startup you need to get into your BIOS ( usually F2 - check manufacturer 's specification ) , and find where you can specify the boot order . Select a low-numbered boot order item , and set it to USB-HDD ( if availble , otherwise another USB option ) . This may require several attempts until the right device option is found.Since most USB drives are ATAPI-compliant , your BIOS should detect it as if it were an external USB hard drive.Just make sure you specify a boot order BEFORE your internal hard drive ( usually HDD , or IDE0 ) , otherwise your system will always boot to the hard drive.Also , you need to format the USB drive as a bootable drive . If you can get the system to boot from a DOS , Windows or Linux floppy disk , you can try installing DOS , Windows 95/98 , or Linux ( Win2000 , and WinXP require more than 256Mb for sytem files ) . Your system will likely assign the USB drive as the C : & # 92 ; drive ( MAKE SURE THIS IS THE CASE BEFORE FORMATTING ! ! ! ) .Keep in mind that most USB drives are slower than hard drives , so performance may not be up to par . The newer `` high-speed '' drives are faster , but not comparable to a real hard drive.If no options work , your Micro Valut may not be ATAPI-compliant , or it 's USB-HDD firmware may not be compatible with your system . I had this happen with a SanDisk Cruzer mini , but a PNY Attache worked.If I may make one suggestion as well ... make a bootable CD with your images instead . CD 's are much more rugged , and can not be accidentally erased . Duplicates are EXTREMELY cheaper ( about 5 cents vs. $ 20 ) than the USB drive solution . Many more BIOS ' support booting from CD ( for about 10 years now ) , so compatibility is usually not an issue . All of the commercial CD-burning packages ( including most of the LITE versions ) support making bootable CD 's . The only trick is to make a bootable floppy that it can use to create the boot image on the CD .",0

Historically , when coming to a camp , we would greet the sentry with `` shalom aleichem ! '' or `` peace be among you '' , ( almost a question and statement at the same time ) and the appropriate response from the sentry would be `` aleichem shalom '' or `` among us , there is peace '' This lets the vistors know that everything is fine at the camp , and that they are welcome to enter the camp .

"Should I buy step-in snowboard bindings ? I used these before and really liked them , but a few friends told me not to buy them . But I like the convenience ! it 's all personal preference .

It looks like a regular strap binding , but the straps are on a frame that can detach from the base plate . It 's hard to explain but really kool.Flows are the other main choice . The back flips down and you slide your boot in .

"i 've seen alot of shoes left on the side of the street , some people say it 's a sign for some thing , what is it ? Some of the reasons for this which I have noted : Thieves drop stuff on the road they do not want and are trying to get rid of , often at night or early morning hours . I have even seen many boxes of very expensive cigars.Dogs play with shoes left outside or in trash.People who are drunk lose shoes.People who are struck by vehicle , sometimes shoe ( s ) come off.Stuff falls out/off vehicles while people are moving.Kids throw things out of cars.Some people throw things out of windows.Sometimes you see brand new boot or shoe , but seldom both left and right.Generally I think it is mostly a sign of carelessness and trashiness . Found in big city/environs much more than elsewhere.In Philadelphia I saw a huge difference between burroughs where there was a fine for littering and those where not.The trashiest city of all my extensive travels is Detroit , hands down the big winner.You can actually see people driving and flinging all fast food remnants and garbage out virtually any day . And lots of beer bottles 11pm -- 2am.So , I think it is trashiness and careless sign . In that regard it also reflects societal deterioration away from the desired norms of responsibility , care and cleanliness.The best solution is more of the latter . But that is also difficult to enforce . Nevertheless , I am for at least a $ 50 fine in urban areas , with an alternative of two days of participation in a clean up team . On second offense , both . On third offense , one month of weekends , same for fourth thru sixth . If someone does not reform after all that , I do not know what to do . Prison is too much a drain on taxpayer .

The only real reason to get married is if you love someone unconditionally , and are willing to support and care for that person the rest of your life.Of course , if you just do n't have self control enough to wait for the right one to come along , then by all means get married to the one you lust for , but remember , it 's for life !",0
"The End Times : Great Revival or Great Apostasy ? Many prophecies in mainstream Christianity have come out declaring a great influx ( revival ) of souls into the Kingdom of God before Jesus returns . Why then does Jesus declare : And then shall many be offended , and shall betray one another , and shall hate one another . And many false prophets shall rise , and shall deceive many . And because iniquity shall abound , the love of many shall wax cold . But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved . ( Matthew 24:10-13 ) And why would He ask : ... Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ? ( Luke 18:8 ) Just curious to hear others ' opinions ... 2 Thes . 2:1-3 ( NKJV ) Now , brethren , concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him , we ask you , [ 2 ] not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled , either by spirit or by word or by letter , as if from us , as though the day of Christ had come . [ 3 ] Let no one deceive you by any means ; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first , and the man of sin is revealed , the son of perdition , ______________I do not believe in the `` Left Behind '' rapture theory that is being preached in a lot of churches today.There will be a great falling away when the tribulation comes upon us all . It will not be easy being a Christian . Many will depart from us because they are not Christians.The end will not have a great revival . Even the current revivals are not great . I do not see many strong Christians . I see a lot of people professing Christ with their mouths but not with their lives and producing fruit.Where 's the fruit ? No fruit ? No Christian.Luke 3:9 ( NKJV ) And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees . Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire . '' John 15:8 ( NIV ) This is to my Father 's glory , that you bear much fruit , showing yourselves to be my disciples .",0

"do you believe in god ? I know there is a God . I did n't arrive at this conclusion by my intellect , for human intelligence is limited . Give up on trying to figure everything out , for common sense itself should tell you that you ca n't know or understand everything . This is not a matter of the head , but of the heart . Ask yourself this : `` If God is the truth , do I really want to know the truth ? '' Our sinfulness makes us afraid of a holy and righteous God who we feel must demand an accounting of us His creatures . Atheists say they do n't believe in God , but I do n't believe in atheists . If they do n't believe in God , then who are they so mad at ? They claim wisdom and knowledge and call believers simple , but I see atheists as being extremely smallminded and limited . Did atoms and microbes not exist until some human came along who was smart enough to detect them ? How small these people 's reality must be ! How futile and pointless their existence ! I commend you for at least being openminded enough to ask ? How foolish it is to think that one 's ignorance is evidence ! Thanks for not being that way , wisdom is not beyond the grasp of one such as yourself . There is a God ; He is beyond human comprehension ; He is absolutely holy , righteous , and frightfuly just . His awesome majesty and power is terrifying and he is completely unapproachable by vile , prideful humans . Remember I said that it is our innate sense of this reality that drives some to deny His existense out of fear of the truth . They ca n't face themselves and their guilt , and they ca n't face a righteously angry , holy , and just God whom they rightly think will demand retribution of them . What they do n't understand is that this same God is also infinitely loving , kind , gracious and merciful , and that He paid the penalty for their sins and removed their guilt which was keeping them from Him . How ? He gave us His only begotten Son Jesus Christ who took our sins and guilt upon his holy and innocent self and was put to death so that we may go free . Believe this , make claim to it as a FREE GIFT from God , confess it to Him and to others , then walk in peace from now on with Him , always trusting Jesus ' sacrifice as your justification in God 's eyes , not your own merit . Then keep on learning more of Him and growing spiritually. > < > Sir Brian",0

Since that time , in order to maintain consistency , it has changed stocks and the number of stocks so that it is no longer a simple average or sum of the stocks contained in it . For each stock listed in the DJIA , each is multiplied by a fractional number to get it 's value for the whole . These numbers are then added up and posted as the number of points the Dow is worth .

"how can I make my Linksys router encryption work with SBC DSL ? The only way it works now is w/o encryption. ? I 've tried using Linksys ' 64-bit and 128-bit encryption for its wireless router . When I try to use them , I lose my SBC Global DSL connection to the internet . You internet connection is n't going down but only the ability of your wireless devices to access the internet . Once you enable encryption on your router you then need to configure you laptop/pc 's wireless connection to match the ssid and wep key . Once that is done then your connection should work just fine . Wep is n't the best security but it is a start . If you are going to use it then I would use 128bit and disable broadcast ssid . As for configuring your laptop/pc it depends on if you are using an application or depending on windows to control the wireless card . An external card could be using an application . If it is an internal built in card then more than likely it is being controlled by windows . You can go to your network connections and verify .

"i dunno how to have sex & i'l b gettin maried soon.being a muslim i cant evr do it b4 my weding.i need help ? actually being a muslim and then eastern culture we girls dont know much about sex.my fiance like girls who are active sexually.i dunno how to do it.im scared i wont b able to satisfy him.i tried searching online but didnt get get any proper information.its not possible for me to buy those kinda books or watch movies that would help me.coz first of all they arent that easily available and my family wont ever let me watch it.but my fiance really wants me to know more about it.what can i do about it ? where can i get the info from ? i know the obvious answer that many are probably thinking , if he loves you then you will be fine . in fact the is not at true as most people would like to think . Your not just talking about sex you 're talking about intamcy as well . WHen you do have sex for the first time i wo n't lie it hurts . The reason it will hurt for the most part is because oyu will be so nervous about be nakeed and having sex that all of your muscles will be conctracting . Which will then in turn make it that more difficult for your finance to enter . just remeber that when you have sex with him that he loves oyu he wo n't be juding you in anyway he will be overwhelmed with the fact that he is with you for the rest of his life that he will just be in awe . also keep in mind that the first time is going to be a little bumpy because you two do n't know each others movements yets . so yees it will be awkward . having sex for the first time is different for eeveryone . but it may be easier , since it seems to me that he has had sex before , if he were to get on top . so that way you wo n't feeel that yopu have to do everything . Something that might make it easier is buy some kind of lubercation it makes it easier to get sttarted . with the lubercation you put it on him to make it more arousing for him and this will give you and oppurtunity to see , and feel what your husband feels like . make it fun for yourself . while you are doing that for him he could be doing something for you . either kissing your neck messaging your inner thighs . if you have a little for play it might take away some of the tension . It is most definetly going to be hard for you to be doing all of this . but just remeber that it will get easier . do n't forget that he 's not the only one that is there for fun . soemthing that might also arouse him and you as well is take is hands and put them on various parts of you and then you return the favor while he carressing you you do the same . moving on to the sex part of it . pull him towaards you so that he knows to get on top . then opoen your legs so that it is comfortable to you and he can get his whole body in . if you do n't feel comfortable adjust and then proceed . when he starts to insert in to you MAKE SURE HE GOES SLOWLY . if anything starts to hurt tell him adn he should either stop or pull out . the key is to communicate . IT will be uncomfortable the first couple of times that you do it . but the lubercation should help out to some degree . After he has entered all the way , now is the time when you should be more relaxed . Now the hardest paart is over . While haveing sex make suree at all times that you are comfortable if your not then sex just wo n't be the same later . if your lower back hurts put a pillow under neith your back and continue . if you do n't know how to move your body then have him move your body so that you both will enjoy it . and if you feel comfortable enough you amy want to get on top . If you do get on to , then just bend your knees so that they are by his hips , and sit directly over top of his penis . oncew he is back inside then move back towards is knees slightly and begin to move . if you do n't know how take is haveds and put them on your hips and let him know that he needs to help . once he gets you going you can do it on your own . Of course this is all just a suggestion and you should do what feels right to you , i hope that i could help you CONGRADULATIONS and good luck . just remember RELAX .",0

Atheist is a general statement about a non belief in any God concept.Hard Atheist : This is the person who says that God does not exist , affirmatively.Weak Atheist : This is a person who does not feel that there is any quality evidence for the existence of God . They do not rule the concept of God out definitely , but they see no reason to believe in any of the Gods they know of.Agnostic : Agnosticism is not a position on whether one believes in God or not , it is a position on whether one believes that it is possible to know positively whether God exists or not .

"What type of rocks are usually taken from quarries ? Any type of rock or mineral ore can be quarried if the deposit is close enough to the surface of the earth . Most quarry operations are for limestone and dolomite in the US . The primary product of quarries is what is called 'natural aggregates ' which most people just call gravel . Of the natural aggregates produced in the US , 71 % are limestone and dolomite , 15 % are granite , and 8 % is from gabbro , basalt and diabase . The remaining 6 % is sandstone , quartzite , marble , slate , shell , and volcanic cinder and scoria . These statistics are from the USGS . Coal strip mines and iron and copper open pit mines are generally not called quarries , but are very much the same in that they dig into the earth in open holes to recover minerals .

"What is the speed of light in inches per second ? Hi Writholeen , the only flaw in JayNick 's answer is the accuracy part . As per the National Institute of Standards and Technology , the exact value of Speed of Light in vacuum is 299,792,458 m/s . By exact , I mean there is no uncertainity till the last digit . To be precise , what we usually call the `` speed of light '' is really the speed of light in a vacuum ( the absence of matter ) . In reality , the speed of light depends on the material that light moves through . Thus , for example , light moves slower in glass than in air , and in both cases the speed is less than in a vacuum . However , the density of matter between the stars is sufficiently low that the actual speed of light through most of interstellar space is essentially the speed it would have through a vacuum , so we do n't make much error by ignoring the difference.To make it easier for you to convert , here is the speed in alternative units : ( 1 ) 983,571,056.4304461 foot/second ( 2 ) 11,802,852,677.165352 inch/second ( 3 ) 1,079,252,848.8 kilometer/hour ( 4 ) 299,792.458 kilometer/second ( 5 ) 582,749,918.3585312 knot ( 6 ) 880,991.0899527 mach ( 7 ) 670,616,629.3843952 mile/hour ( mph ) These values are accurate to the 7th digit of decimal . Flaw in JayNick 's answer : The speed of light in kilometres per second is 279,600 kilometres/sec . Even if you approximate the actual value , 299,792.458 kilometer/second by round off the last three digit , the value would have been 300,000 kilometers per second .",0
"what is the best indoor cycling trainer ? I am looking at a fluid trainer , a CycleOps Fluid2 , or a Mag trainer , but do n't know the real difference between the two . I 'd like to get some comment or opinions ob various brands out there as well . I went through this exercise last winter , and actually decided to go with Kreitler Dyno-Lyte rollers . The reason is that rollers require you to learn balance . Having better balance makes you a more fluid cyclist , a better bike handler , and you 'll be able to ride a line as straight as anyone . Plus , it 's not nearly as boring as being tethered by your back wheel ! My general feeling is that I felt like a trainer would make me lazier overall , even if I were gaining strength.The only downside for me is that rollers will wear out your back tire by the end of winter .

"How to put in color ink from an ink installation kit ? I have a Lexmark Z611 printer and I have an emty ink cartridge but I have this kit were I can put more ink into it but I do n't know exactly were to drill the holes to put in some more color ink . Can someone help me ? Your cartridge needs to have the top popped in order to refill . HOWEVER , make sure the cartridge has not been run empty , or it will not respond to refilling . Also if you have removed the cartridge and it is just sitting on your desk , then it will not respond either . The printhead needs to be kept damp , or protected . The last thing you need to know is that you MUST have lexmark 10n0026 ink . If you bought one of the universal kits , you may be stuck with ink that is too thin and will leak , or ink that is too thick and will clog.Once you determine that all is OK , simply use a knife to pry off the top of the cartridge , and if you can not tell which color goes where , use a tooth pick to determine which color is where . these are small cartridges and will not require much ink , so fill very slowly . Watch the printhead and the top of the cartridge at the same time . At the first sign of ink coming from the print head - STOP and pull back a bit on the needle ( a very little bit ) . You should also watch the top of the cartridge , as to avoid having the ink pour out of the top . Repeat for all colors . Hope this helps.If you have to remove the cartridge prior to refilling , then you should place it in a zipper bag along with a slightly damp paper towel , until you can get to it . It must remain moist , but not wet , and do not store in the freezer .",0

"Are there any plutonium compounds ? Plutonium reacts readily with oxygen , forming PuO and PuO2 , as well as intermediate oxides . It reacts with the halides , giving rise to compounds such as PuX3 where X can be F , Cl , Br or I ; PuF4 is also seen . The following oxyhalides are observed : PuOCl , PuOBr and PuOI . It will react with carbon to form PuC , nitrogen to form PuN and silicon to form PuSi2.Plutonium like other actinides readily forms a dioxide plutonyl core ( PuO2 ) . In the environment , this plutonyl core readily complexes with carbonate as well as other oxygen moeities ( OH- , NO2- , NO3- , and SO4-2 ) to form charged complexes which can be readily mobile with low affinities to soil . * PuO2 ( CO3 ) 1-2 * PuO2 ( CO3 ) 2-4 * PuO2 ( CO3 ) 3-6PuO2 formed from neutralizing highly acidic nitric acid solutions tends to form polymeric PuO2 which is resistant to complexation .

"How is Iron ore mined ? Modern mines , in Minnesota and Michigan in the US , and Eastern Canada mine taconite . Taconite is a term to describe magnetite ore that is very hard and fine-grained . Taconite must be first processed into iron oxide pellets by crushing and magnetic separation of the magnetite to concentrate the iron to about 66 % before it can be used in steel-making.Taconite mining involves moving tremendous amounts of ore and waste . The waste comes in two forms , bedrock in the mine ( mullock ) that is n't ore , and unwanted minerals which are an intrinsic part of the ore rock itself ( gangue ) . The mullock is mined and piled in waste dumps , and the gangue is separated during the beneficiation process and is removed as tailings . Taconite tailings are mostly the mineral quartz , which is chemically inert . This material is stored in large , regulated water settling ponds.In Australia iron ore is won from three main sources ; massive magnetite ore as at Savage River , Tasmania ; pisolite `` channel-iron '' ore derived by mechanical erosion of primary banded-iron formations and accumulated in alluvial channels such at Robe River , Western Australia ; and banded iron formation related ores such as at Newman , Hamersley and Koolyanobbing , Western Australia . Other types of ore are coming to the fore recently , such as oxidised ferruginous hardcaps , for instance iron ore deposits near Argyle , Western Australia.World production averages one billion metric tons of raw ore annually . The world 's largest producer of iron ore is the Brazilian mining corporation CVRD , followed by Australian companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto Group . China is currently the largest consumer of iron ore , which translates to be the world 's largest steel producing country . Iron ore is common worldwide , but commercial mining operations are dominated by the countries listed below : Estimated iron ore production in million tons for 2004 , according to U.S. Geological Survey [ 2 ] China 280 Australia 220 Brazil 220 India 110 Russia 95 United States 54 Ukraine 66 South Africa 40 Canada 31 Sweden 22 Venezuela 18 Kazakhstan 17 Iran 16 Mauritania 10 Mexico 12 Other countries 40 Total world 1250 [ edit ] RefiningPure elemental iron is virtually unknown on the surface of the Earth except as wüstite from meteorites and very rare forms of deep mantle xenoliths . Therefore , all sources of iron used by human industry exploit iron oxide minerals , the primary form which is used in industry being hematite.However , in some situations , more inferior iron ore sources have been used by industrialised societies when access to high-grade hematite ore was not available . This has included utilisation of taconite in the United State , particularly during World War II , and goethite or bog ore used during the Revolutionary war and the Napoleonic wars . Magnetite is often used because it is magnetic and hence easily liberated from the gangue minerals.Inferior sources of iron ore generally required beneficiation . Due to the high density of hematite relative to silicates , beneficiation usually involves a combination of crushing and milling as well as heavy liquid separation . This is achieved by passing the finely crushed ore over a bath of solution containing bentonite or other agent which increases the density of the solution . When the density of the solution is properly calibrated , the hematite will sink and the silicate mineral fragments will float and can be removed.Magnetite is beneficiated by crushing and then separating the magnetite from the gangue minerals with a magnet . This is usually so efficient that lower grade ore can be treated when it is magnetite than a comparable grade of hematite ore , especially when the magnetite is quite coarse.To convert an oxide of iron to metallic iron it must be smelted .",0

"why did terry bradshaw not appear with the mvp 's in the super bowl ? When the NFL unveiled its MVPs from the previous 39 Super Bowls , only three living members skipped the ceremony.Former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana and former Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw decided to stay home , while former Dolphins MVP Jake Scott was traveling in Australia.Montana , the league 's only three-time Super Bowl MVP , and Bradshaw reportedly turned down the invitation over money.Both denied the reports.In a phone interview with ESPN2 's Cold Pizza on Monday night , Montana vehemently denied forgoing the ceremony over money and reiterated that his absence was due to his preference to see his son 's basketball game.He 'd told Cold Pizza last week he was n't going to be at the game because his son had an important basketball game he wanted to attend . Bradshaw , according to the Chronicle , told league officials he wanted to be with his family.Montana said money was never an issue and that he would not have attended the Super Bowl ceremony even if the appearance fee had been greater than the $ 100,000 he was reported to have requested.Former MVPs were given $ 1,000 for incidental expenses while in Detroit , along with other amenities such as plane tickets , car rental and game tickets.Sources told each paper that Montana asked for a guarantee of at least $ 100,000 in appearance money.When the league balked at Montana 's demands , the quarterback declined to be in attendance .",0

"Is it better to rent , own or build a home in California these days ? Seems that renting is cheaper and you could save money . But at the same time , money depreciate , so may be it is better to invest ? So , if not renting , then build or buy ? And with the prediction of high interest rate and the buble burst , it is very difficult to make a decision . California is among the most overheated markets in real estate so buying now MAY get you into a financial mess by overpaying . Renting is always a waste of money . If you can get LAND at a reasonable price then building a home will avoid the profit you would pay a homeowner for an existing home . That 's just my opinion.Imran",0

"What is special about the number 1729 ? A Zeisel number is a square-free integer k with at least three prime factors which fall into the patternpx = apx − 1 + b where a and b are some integer constants and x is the index number of each prime factor in the factorization , sorted from lowest to highest . For the purpose of determining Zeisel numbers , p0 = 1 . The first few Zeisel numbers are105 , 1419 , 1729 , 1885 , 4505 , 5719 , 15387 , 24211 , 25085 , 27559 , 31929 , 54205 , 59081 , 114985 , 207177 , 208681 , 233569 , 287979 , 294409 , 336611 , 353977 , 448585 , 507579 , 982513 , 1012121 , 1073305 , 1242709 , 1485609 , 2089257 , 2263811 , 2953711 ( sequence A051015 in OEIS ) . To give an example , 1729 is a Zeisel number with the constants a = 1 and b = 6 , its factors being 7 , 13 and 19 , falling into the patternp1 = 7 , p1 = 1p0 + 6 p2 = 13 , p2 = 1p1 + 6 p3 = 19 , p3 = 1p2 + 6 1729 is an example for Carmichael numbers of the kind ( 6n+1 ) ( 12n+1 ) ( 18n+1 ) , which satisfied the pattern px = apx − 1 + b with a= 1 and b = 6n , so that every Carmichael number , you can construct with the formula ( 6n+1 ) ( 12n+1 ) ( 18n+1 ) , is a Zeisel number.Other Carmichael numbers of that kind are : 294409 , 56052361 , 118901521 , 172947529 , 216821881 , 228842209 , 1299963601 , 2301745249 , 9624742921 , ... The name Zeisel numbers was probably introduced by Kevin Brown , who was looking for numbers that when plugged into the equation2k − 1 + k yield prime numbers . In a posting to the newsgroup sci.math on 1994-02-24 , Helmut Zeisel pointed out that 1885 is one such number . Later it was discovered ( by Kevin Brown ? ) that 1885 additionally has prime factors with the relationship described above , so a name like Brown-Zeisel Numbers might be more appropriate .",0

Generally called `` OLE controls '' or `` OLE custom controls , '' they appear to the end user as just another part of the program.OCXs are Microsoft 's second-generation component architecture . Unlike first-generation 16-bit Visual Basic controls ( VBXs ) , which were only written in Visual Basic , OCXs can be written in several languages and come in 16-bit and 32-bit versions . OCXs were renamed ActiveX controls and continue to use the .OCX file extension . Both VBX and OCX controls have now been superseded by ActiveX controls . However , ActiveX is backward compatible with OCX controls , which means that ActiveX containers , such as Microsoft 's Internet Explorer , can execute OCX components .",0

"does outter space ever end ? ? The best guess today : no.In modern cosmology the topology of the universe appears to be open . `` Topology '' meaning the shape , although in the case of the universe to observe the shape we would have to exist in 4 spatial dimensions . Since we 're stuck in 3-dimensions we have to get by on analogies.The topology or shape of the universe is something which comes out of Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity . It depends primarily on the distribution of mass and energy in the universe . If the amount of mass-energy is more than a certain critical value then the universe would be `` closed . '' Basically the mass would curve space-time back onto itself . In a closed universe you could fly off in the direction of the north pole and ( after about 25 billion years ) and circle the universe to land on the south pole.If the amount of mass in the universe is less than this critical value then the topology of the universe is a bit more complex , but , to answer your question space would be infinite.Based on what we know today that is the case , space is infinite.However , we can not see an infinite universe . When we see things that are farther away we also see them from deeped in the past . A galaxy we see that is 10 billion light years distant is actually a view of what the galaxy looked like 10 billion years in the past.When we look farther in space , and thus earlier in the history of the universe , we eventually run into the microwave background . For the first 10,000 years or so after the Big Bang the universe was so dense that it was n't yet transparent . When the density dropped enough to be transparent then some of the light could escape for us to detect much later.However , while the universe is thought to be about 13 billion years old , we can actually see out a bit farther than that , I think around 20 billion light years , because the universe is expanding.What this boils down to is that there is a sort of `` wall '' beyond which we ca n't see . This wall corresponds to a time soon after the Big Bang . However , studies of the total mass-energy within the universe strongly suggest that it has an open topology - that it is infinite . ( Of course it is possible that this infinity will be refined when we have a better theory of how Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity play togther . String Theory is one way to combine these two . )",0

Should we be forced to love this country or should love of country come from the individuals ability to reason ? As a child , I remember reciting the Pledge of Allegiance on a daily basis up to a certain point - exactly what year we stopped escapes me at the moment , however . I do n't have a problem with that - as a United States citizen , I do n't mind the occasional exercise in patriotism.However , before it can be taught in schools ( if ever ) , there needs to be a consensus on how the concept is presented . The last thing I 'd want is some stereotypical militant white supremacist or some disenchanted cynic teaching the course or devising the curriculum.How 's *that* for a somewhat-less-than-concrete answer ? Truthfully , I hate any type of mind control methods , but we have the choice of whether or not to stay here - if we choose to stay , then we should exercise some loyalty and respect for the Constitution and the laws of the land . However , recognizing our freedoms includes speaking up when things are going wrong and need to be changed - being a true patriot means you want the bad things changed and not for anyone to be stuck with the `` America : love it or leave it '' idiocy .",0

"Before the Dodgers where brooklyn or Los Angeles they had 4 different names can you name them ? Names were a bit fluid then , and they were called by lots of names ( The official website lists `` Bridegrooms , Trolly Dodgers , Superbas , Ward 's Wonders , and Foutz ' Fillies '' ) : The moniker `` Bridegrooms '' was attached to Manager William `` Gunner '' McGunnigle 's 1890 ballclub because seven of the players got married around the same time in 1888 . Despite the success of the Bridegrooms , McGunnigle did n't last past the initial year and the team paraded through six different managers before the end of the decade . The skippers included John Montgomery Ward ( 1891-92 ) , Dave Foutz ( 1893-96 ) , William Barnie ( 1897-98 ) , Mike Griffin ( 1898 ) , Charles H. Ebbets ( 1898 ) and Ned Hanlon ( 1899-1905 ) . The term `` Trolley Dodgers '' was attached to the Brooklyn ballclub due to the complex maze of trolley cars that weaved its way through the borough of Brooklyn . The name was then shortened to just `` Dodgers . '' During the 1890s , other popular nicknames were Ward 's Wonders , Foutz 's Fillies and Hanlon 's Superbas .",0

She needs to be able to come to the conclusion on her own that she made a mistake , and that this other guy is not the one for her it simply is not something you can coerce her into . If you try , you will do nothing more than to drive a larger wedge into your already shattered relationship . Give her space and time to miss you , and if she does n't then you have your answer but she ca n't miss you if you continue to cling to her.Also , I think something that you might need to consider as well is would you ever be able to move past her betrayal of you trust ? After all she did start another relationship before ending the one with you first . One other thing to consider is that perhaps your lives are just taking two different paths at the moment . Maybe she felt that she wanted someone more inline with her own personal goals and aspirations .",0

"do fish drink water ? Web research seems to indicate that most fish do drink plenty of water , some continuously . Some fish absorb water through their skin and/or gills , and may excrete water that way , too . Apparently , fish need to maintain a fairly high concentration of salt , so how a fish deals with this need depends on whether it is a saltwater or freshwater fish . Most saltwater fish get enough or too much salt , and so preventing water loss is their concern . Freshwater fish are short on salt , and since water dilutes sodium , they have many mechanisms for excreting water . It is interesting to note that kidneys process water for excretion , so some saltwater fish have dysfunctional kidneys or are missing kidneys to help prevent water loss . The four `` water/salt '' strategies are listed below : -- -- -- Admin Note : The problem with fish vs. watery environment has do with the process of osmosis , defined as 'net movement of water molecules through a semipermeable membrane from a dilute solution to a more concentrated solution . The 'membrane ' is the 'skin ' or any other part of the fish that separates it from the water . If the concentration of salts and other solutes in the fish is greater than the outside , watery world , the fish takes on water ( natural attempt to 'dilute the fish to what it 's like outside ' - bad for the fish ) . In scientific terms the fish is hypertonic to its surroundings ( freshwater fish , e.g. ) . If a fish is hypotonic to its environment ( marine fish ) , then the seawater has a higher solute concentration than the fish ; the fish loses water to its surroundings ( also bad for the fish ) . Kidneys function to overcome the effects of osmosis so fishX can stay either more or less concentrated than its environment. -- -- --",0

However , due to the increased control using today 's electronics , I ca n't see them as being as effective as FI turbocharged . When you increase the airflow to the engine ( turbocharging and supercharging are forced induction ) you must increase the fuel as well , otherwise you will end up in an incredibly lean condidtion and damage the motor . Motors work best with a specific air/fuel ratio . With carbs you must re jet for the best compromised AFR . With FI you can `` map '' the fuel to maintain the best AFR over the entire range of RPM .

"who discovered the atom ? Democritus and Leucippus , Greek philosophers in the 5th century BC , presented the first theory of atoms ( see article atomism for more details ) . The Greeks believed that atoms were all made of the same material but had different shapes and sizes , which determined the physical properties of the material . For instance , the atoms of a liquid were thought to be smooth , allowing them to slide over each other . This theory was not founded on experimental evidence.In 1808 , John Dalton proposed that an element is composed of a single , unique type of atoms , and that whilst their shape or structure was immutable , atoms of different elements could combine to form more complex structures ( compounds ) . Through his experiments , Dalton discovered the law of multiple proportions - that is , if two elements form more than one compound between them , then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers .",0

"I am obsessing about a cold sore , should i worry or am i being a hypochondriac ? Do not become orally intimate with someone 's nether regions , ( just in case you were thinking of doing that ) with a cold sore . I was just at the doctor for the cold sores that I get on my lip and they informed me that yes in fact you can spread the virus that way . Do n't obsess , stress can make them worse and cause them to come out more frequently . If you get them on a semi regular basis , go to a clinic or your regular doctor , they have an anti-viral pill that will help you greatly . Abreva and such only dry out the blisters , so does ear wax believe it or not . Most adults have the herpe virus in their system , but a smaller percentage have symptoms . Ice also breaks the virus down quicker once you have the blisters , and aspirin will reduce pain and take the swelling down . Do n't ever break the blisters they are freakishly contagious . Other than that , relax , they 're a pain in the ass , but unless you have a problem with your immune system , you 'll live .",0

A hot pad , on thirty minutes , off for thirty minutes . Do n't burn the area . It will also go away by itself .

Ibuprofen , like Advil , is standard treatment . If you are normal sized , you can take maybe 3 Advil 4x/day for it . You want to make sure you do n't have untreated PID ( Pelvic Inflammatory Disease ) . Acute PID is caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia , which are STD 's . Chronic PID can occur without any new sexually transmitted infection , once you have had acute PID . A course of doxycycline 100mg twice a day and maybe metronidazole ( flagyl ) 500mg three times a day , might help if you have chronic PID . Fibroids , which are benign growths in uterus , can cause dysmennorhea . Endometriosis , which is uterine lining -- -- endometrial tissue -- -growing where it do n't belong out in tube or in pelvis , can cause alot of dysmennorhea .

The kids want me to win them a tropy next year so im gon na do it . There are only a handfull of base plays that beginners need to know : Belly , Option , Sweep and Iso . Each play has its variations . There are at least thirty base option plays that have their own variations.The important thing is to know the basic idea of each . Play Madden , watch the games on TV , play with your buddies . More important than knowing the plays are your fundamental skills .

I read the paper that Bruce wrote , but couldnt understand it fully ... .Can please some explain it to me ? ? Please ... dont paste the same thing that is on the website , tell me what you understand ! Thankyou ! ! ! IT is a Copy Paste But may be of some use ... .BlowFishBlowFish/TwoFish is a widespread security algorithm , which was published by Bruce Schneier in the beginning of the year 1994 . This algorithm works similar to DES and it uses block coding with blocks of a size of 64 bit . BlowFish was spread very fast after its publication , due to the fact that Bruce Schneier is one of the most famous cryptology experts and that this algorithm can be used without licence fee . In addition , using this algorithm data can be en- and decoded with high speed . If the routine for BlowFish is implemented in software , a disk space of less than five kilobytes is sufficient . You can vary the size of the key as as you like up to 448 bit . That is why this algorithm with its 2 448 different possibilities is protected against any Brute Force Attacks . This is how the encryption algorithm BlowFish works : BlowFish defines two different S boxes , a P box and four S boxes . The P box P is a one-dimensional field with 18 32-bit-values . The boxes contain accidental values , which are implemented in the code or generated during each initialization . The S boxes S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 contain 256 32-bit-values each . The BlowFish initialization looks like this : The key string is converted into 32-bit-values . The entire content of the P box is substituted by the values xor ’ t . The P box is now encrypted like the S box . BlowFish encryption ( block size : 64 Bit , rounds ( r ) : 16 ) : The data element is divided into two parts L and R , each of 32 bit . L is xor ’ t with P r. R is xor ’ t with f ( L ) . L and R are interchanged . This is done 16 times , until r =16 . R is xor ’ t with P 17 . L is xor ’ t with P 18 . Explanation of function f : The incoming 32-bit-value ( L in this case ) is divided into four 8-bit-vectors X1 , X2 , X3 , X4 . With the help of these vectors a 32-bit-value is selected from every S box . The result is linked by addition and xor . For decoding data , the entire process is performed the other way round .",0

It is very object-oriented ( similar to Java ) , and it compiles to an intermediate language ( the .NET IL ) , which means the code may run a little slower but is safer.For more information , read the articles below .

"Are pheromones found in human beings ? Humans have one or more pheromones ( originally called `` exaltolides '' ) , presumed to exist for some years , but formally accepted to exist in 1986 . They are strongest in women during the time period around ovulation and work subliminally ( at concentrations too small to recognize as an odor ) . They are responsible for women who live together , as in a dorm , synchronizing their ovulatory cycles . Men emit some at a regular rate , but the importance of this is not understood . At stronger concentrations these pheromones have a musky , even offensive , smell - thus the prevalence of musk-type perfumes trying to mimic the effect . It is the buildup of exaltolides in the air that may cause the heightened social activities in everybody at a crowded cocktail party or a dance . The increased body temperature from physical activity will increase evaporation into the air .",0

Too young to be cast as leading lady , she started with bit roles only , but was not missed , and quickly graduated to lead roles in low budget movies . She was extremely versatile , beautiful , charming , and stole everybody 's heart by her captivating looks and inspired performances in each of her film . She quickly out-shadowed and dethroned the established queens in a very short time because of her histrionics . Mumtaz was sensitive , quick to understand and translate every nuance hinted at , onto the screen . Even in her brief roles against established actresses , she was the one who got noticed more and lingered in viewers memories for longer periods . She acted in more than 100 films during a short career span of 14 years , and there is not even a single film in which her performance could not be termed as excellent . In her very first film with significant banner and role , Khilona ( 1970 ) , she won the most coveted Filmfare award in 1970 . She has also been awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by Filmfare in 1997 . She was in the Marilyn Monroe mould ; every man 's fantasy woman . She outshone everybody because of the simple reason that she was so versatile that every role appeared as if it was written with just Mumtaz in mind . Whether the role was negative or positive , serious or light , she proved her worth . Whether the role was for an urbanite or rustic , majestic or pauper , innocent or vile , gentle or venomous , coy or flaunting , Mumtaz just fitted them like a glove . The public adulation for her is still strong . The response to the continuous spate of screening of her movies on various television channels , even after more than two decades of her self-retirement , proves her tremendous unending popularity due to her incomparable charisma .",0

"Earth is a phenomena and a woman too is a phenomena .Man is part of this phenomena . Why GOD is called HE ? read Concept of God has emerged in the mankind after being born and based on the behaviour pattern of human beings alone.Religions have unable to convey the essence and existance of GOD which could unite every human being without doubts.Religions have created more doubts . However many followers , which kept dividing in numbers , according to technical interpretations , and , became politicl force.Reality of the ABSOLUTE got lost.Earth lost importance , motherhood too lost significance.What is reality ? A spermis a phenomena but is part of of a phenomena called Ovum.Mensurations periods of a woman are like monsoon periods on Earth which prepares itself for creating life all arround .Woman sheds her blood and earth the essence of blood , water.In stead of calling let us save this Earth , let Us say O ! mother Earth accept us with LOVE in YOUR WOMB .The GOD inside this phenomena will listen to your prayers .God is experienced in every mode of nature and not outside it as propagated by religion God is commonly referred to in the masculine sense because of the relationship that primarily judaism based religions wished to portray between god and mankind . God the Father , because at the time all the ancient religious texts for these religions were written a family was dominated by the father and rather than using the metaphor of the mother , which would imply at the time that there was some other superior to the God figure , they used a masculine term . This term has persisted due to a continuation of male dominance in society and through the institution of tradition which is now so ancient that many believe it would be heresy to alter it today . It is true that the relationship that many today share with god is much better described as female , but this too stems from the feminization of 'soft ' concepts such as love and procreation . Consequently calling God male or female is 100 % related to culture and I would like to answer your question with a question . Why try to personify god as male or female ? If you follow western society 's modern beleif that male and female are equal , or the more radical belief that there is no definite male or female but shades of gender ( see transgender ) , and if gender serves the sole function of procreation through sexual intercourse why attempt to place the all powerful being that is God within the restraints of a single gender . God does not need to procreate through sexuality as God is capable of creation without thought or effort . So , why call God she ? Why not just understand that God is God regardless of name or gender .",0

"Why use statistics ? I once heard this nice joke at the opening of a conference about statistics : Two experts in statistics go hunting . The first one shoots to a fox and misses it by 5 inches on the right . In the same moment , the second one shoots to the same fox and misses it by 5 inches on the left . So they exclaim together : `` we got it ! `` .The moral of the story : statistics can help you making an idea of some ( not all ) of the phenomena which involve a large number of subjects ( in fact , the same name of the discipline comes from `` state '' , having been developed in the XVII-th century by Pascal and others in order to handle the administration of the raising modern states ) .It does not tell the truth about any single subject of the `` universe '' it studies.It does not promise any certainty about the answers it gives.Most importantly , as the joke teachs , you can not take your statistical projections as valuable in spite of the objectivity of real facts when they clearly appear under your eyes ! Having said this , it can be a useful tool if it is kept in its range of application.Moreover , it may help hunting get more likely to animals , as the probability that an expert in statistics really get one may be very very low !",0
"Where is the gum ? I was told that my gum is healthy if I can see less than 4mm of it . But I thought the gum is the flesh connecting the teeth to the jaw , and I can see the entire pink flesh covering my teeth . There must be at least 1.5cm . How can it be less than 4mm ? Am I missing something ? The 4 mm probably refers to the depth of your gum pockets ( the space betwen the top of your gums to the alveolar bone that holds your teeth . Your dentist would measure this with a probe.If your pockets are deeper than 4 mm then it means that you have had bone loss which is usually caused by periodontal disease ( an infection in the gums ) . The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly ( brush at least twice a day for two minutes ) . I emphasize flossing , because often people do n't realize just how important it is . The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck , and therefore where bacteria sticks most often , too . The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch . So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth , you want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure you remove the plaque . So you should be going up and down two to three times along the tooth on both sides of the contact.Hope this helps !",0

Let her feel the water , learn to enter , pull through and exit properly with each stroke and than work up from their on kicking , body position and breathing .

Do n't say that you will take a tumbler ( somewhat resembles a cone whose conical part is cut and sealed from there . ) and fill it with water and then find the volume of it . well , the formula for the volume of a cone is 1/3 * base * height.the trick to doing this is to find the volume of the large cone , then subtract the volume of the small cone . what 's leftover will be the tumbler-shaped volume . plug in numbers for the height and base for both the large and small cones , and then subtract . voila !",0
"In calculus , could you explain the process of intergrating by substitution ? teacher doesnt explain very well When you are doing integrations , all you are doing is computing an area under a curve . Sometimes the formula for the area will be obvious to you , from something you already know or recognize . Othertimes , you have to transform the problem into one you know already . This is the method called integration by substitution . For example , suppose you want to integrate the function sqrt ( 1 - x^2 ) with respect to x , between some limits . Most times , you will not remember or recognize this integral . However , you might remember that sqrt ( 1- ( sin a ) ^2 ) is cos a , which you know how to integrate , and therefore if you let x=sin a , you have transformed the integral into one you recognize and can easily solve . There is a HUGE amount of material written on this on the internet and in books , but this should get you started . All you are doing is transforming the problem into one that you can solve easier .",0

"If satan had appeared as a man instead of a serpent , would Eve had said `` No-way '' ?

The kangaroo was named during this encounter when Cook asked what the animal was called and the natives replied kangaroo which meant I do n't know . Cook also met briefly with aboriginals on Bruny Island in 1777.Based on his limited meeting , Cook developed an incorrect impression that the inland was largely unoccupied .

"Most gelogists think that the movement of Earth 's plates is caused by what ? a. gravityb . subductionc . convection currentsd . Earths magnetic fields The best answer from the above choices : Slow moving convection currents within the molten aesthenosphere supply new material to the spreading centers in the earth 's ocean floors and other places . These currents are thought to provide force to cause the motion of the oceanic plates , either directly , or indirectly through the mid ocean ridge building process . Subduction is only one part of the process of plate tectonics , that does provide some driving force by pulling the subducting plate downward . Gravity has a role as well , as without gravity , the mid-ocean ridges would not have the weight to provide force with which to push the plates apart at the spreading centers , and the subducting plates would not have the force to pull plates . The earth 's magnetic field may have the least to do with plate tectonics , possibly no role at all .",0

"who killed fernand magellan ? Death of MagellanHeading northwest , the crew reached the equator on 13 February 1521 . On 6 March , they reached the Marianas and on 16 March , the island of Homonhon in the Philippines , with 150 crewmen left . Magellan was able to communicate with the native peoples because his Malay interpreter could understand their language . They traded gifts with Rajah Kolambu of Limasawa , who guided them to Cebu , on April 7 . Rajah Humabon of Cebu was friendly to them , and even agreed to accept Christianity.The initial peace with the Philippine natives proved misleading . Magellan was killed in the Battle of Mactan , against indigenous forces led by Lapu-Lapu , on April 27 , 1521 . Antonio Pigafetta , a wealthy tourist who paid to be on the Magellan voyage , provided the only extant eyewitness account of the events culminating in Magellan 's death , as follows : Monument in Lapu-Lapu City that marks the site where Magellan was purportedly killed '' When morning came , forty-nine of us leaped into the water up to our thighs , and walked through water for more than two cross-bow flights before we could reach the shore . The boats could not approach nearer because of certain rocks in the water . The other eleven men remained behind to guard the boats . When we reached land , [ the natives ] had formed in three divisions to the number of more than one thousand five hundred persons . When they saw us , they charged down upon us with exceeding loud cries ... The musketeers and crossbow-men shot from a distance for about a half-hour , but uselessly ... Recognizing the captain , so many turned upon him that they knocked his helmet off his head twice ... An Indian hurled a bamboo spear into the captain 's face , but the latter immediately killed him with his lance , which he left in the Indian 's body . Then , trying to lay hand on sword , he could draw it out but halfway , because he had been wounded in the arm with a bamboo spear . When the natives saw that , they all hurled themselves upon him . One of them wounded him on the left leg with a large cutlass , which resembles a scimitar , only being larger . That caused the captain to fall face downward , when immediately they rushed upon him with iron and bamboo spears and with their cutlasses , until they killed our mirror , our light , our comfort , and our true guide . When they wounded him , he turned back many times to see whether we were all in the boats . Thereupon , beholding him dead , we , wounded , retreated , as best we could , to the boats , which were already pulling off .

DO NOT OVERPAY YOUR WRESTLERS you just starting to get in the business and alot of small feds have gone out of business because they overpay.You have to eat too , start paying about $ 10 a head but depends on how many people attends your show for example : A . 50 to 100 people=0.00 payB . 101 to 125 people=10.00 payC . 126 10 150 people=15.00 payThis is just a basic round example3 .

"Is genodide still happening today ? As hard as it may seem to think of us being in the 21st Century with state of the art technology , to also live in an era where Genocide happens everyday may seem unbelievable but it is true . In the Sudan there have been in the neigborhood of 2,000,000 people killed in trying to wipe those of their sect off the face of the Earth . Just because it happens in the far reaches of the world from here does not mean that it is not ocurring . The indiscrimanate act of killing in Drive-by shooting 's is just an example of how it is happening in our own country . When we think of genocide we like to think of ages gone by , however our age is probably having more of this type of things as we have much better ways to kill these days . It is still a daily thing it is just buryed in the back pages of the newspaper when it gets reported at all .",0

"What is existentialism ? Existentialism is about the angst of human existence . The existentialist comes to a crisis ( `` The existential crisis '' ) when he realizes the angst of existence , the utter horror of life . There are different ways of responding to this crisis.Soren Kierkegaard says that when one comes to that point , what one must do is take a leap of faith . This is a Christian existentialism , but many existentialists were/are atheists . Such as Jean-Paul Sartre . He wrote a book called Nausee ( Nausea ) about existence . It is very depressing ! But existentialism does not have to be depressing . Some may call Viktor Frankl a happy existentialist . He wrote a WONDERFUL book called Man 's Search for Meaning about his own experiences in the Holocaust . It is all about finding meaning in life . I HIGHLY recommend that book to everyone !",0

"How are white water rafting rapids categorized ? class i : easy . fast moving water with riffles and small waves . few obstructions , all obvious and easily missed with little training . risk to swimmers is slight ; self-rescue is easy.class ii : novice . straightforward rapids with wide , clear channels which are evident without scouting . occasional maneuvering may be required , but rocks and medium sized waves are easily missed by trained paddlers . swimmers are seldom injured and group assistance , while helpful , is seldom needed . rapids that are at the upper end of this difficulty range are designated `` class ii+ '' .class iii : intermediate . rapids with moderate , irregular waves which may be difficult to avoid and which can swamp an open canoe . complex maneuvers in fast current and good boat control in tight passages or around ledges are often required ; large waves or strainers may be present but are easily avoided . strong eddies and powerful current effects can be found , particularly on large-volume rivers . scouting is advisable for inexperienced parties . injuries while swimming are rare ; self-rescue is usually easy but group assistance may be required to avoid long swims . rapids that are at the lower or upper end of this difficulty range are designated `` class iii- '' or `` class iii+ '' respectively.class iv : advanced . intense , powerful but predictable rapids requiring precise boat handling in turbulent water . depending on the character of the river , it may feature large , unavoidable waves and holes or constricted passages demanding fast maneuvers under pressure . a fast , reliable eddy turn may be needed to initiate maneuvers , scout rapids , or rest . rapids may require ômust '' moves above dangerous hazards . scouting may be necessary the first time down . risk of injury to swimmers is moderate to high , and water conditions may make self-rescue difficult . group assistance for rescue is often essential but requires practiced skills . a strong eskimo roll is highly recommended . rapids that are at the upper end of this difficulty range are designated `` class iv- '' or `` class iv+ '' respectively.class 5 : expert . extremely long , obstructed , or very violent rapids which expose a paddler to added risk . drops may contain large , unavoidable waves and holes or steep , congested chutes with complex , demanding routes . rapids may continue for long distances between pools , demanding a high level of fitness . what eddies exist may be small , turbulent , or difficult to reach . at the high end of the scale , several of these factors may be combined . scouting is recommended but may be difficult . swims are dangerous , and rescue is often difficult even for experts . a very reliable eskimo roll , proper equipment , extensive experience , and practiced rescue skills are essential . because of the large range of difficulty that exists beyond class iv , class 5 is an open ended , multiple level scale designated by class 5.0 , 5.1 , 5.2 , etc ... each of these levels is an order of magnitude more difficult than the last . example : increasing difficulty from class 5.0 to class 5.1 is a similar order of magnitude as increasing from class iv to class 5.0. class vi : extreme and exploratory . these runs have almost never been attempted and often exemplify the extremes of difficulty , unpredictability and danger . the consequences of errors are very severe and rescue may be impossible . for teams of experts only , at favorable water levels , after close personal inspection and taking all precautions . after a class vi rapids has been run many times , it 's rating may be changed to an apppropriate class 5.x rating .",0

"when was asthma first discovered ? The word asthma is derived from the Greek aazein , meaning “ sharp breath. ” The word first appears in Homer 's Iliad ; [ 2 ] Hippocrates was the first to use it in reference to the medical condition . Hippocrates thought that the spasms associated with asthma were more likely to occur in tailors , anglers , and metalworkers . Six centuries later , Galen wrote much about asthma , noting that it was caused by partial or complete bronchial obstruction . Moses Maimonides , an influential medieval rabbi , philosopher , and physician , wrote a treatise on asthma , describing its prevention , diagnosis , and treatment . [ 3 ] In the 17th century , Bernardino Ramazzini noted a connection between asthma and organic dust . The use of bronchodilators started in 1901 , but it was not until the 1960s that the inflammatory component of asthma was recognized , and anti-inflammatory medications were added to the regimen . `` It was Hippocrates ( 460-357 BC ) , the Greek physician , who first described asthma and its resulting 'spasms ' . Galen ( 130-201 BC ) , a Greco-Roman doctor , discovered that asthma was due to bronchial obstruction . He treated it with owl 's blood in wine . `` Italian physician Bernardino Ramazzini described a link between his patient 's asthma and their jobs as far back as the early 1900s . `` Until the late 1800s , the most popular method of delivering asthma medication into the lungs was smoke . `` In 1864 , Dr.Henry Hyde Salter identified animal dander as an asthma trigger . `` In 1901 , a Japanese scientist , Jokici Takamine , purifies adrenaline , found in the suprarenal glands of sheep ( discovered in 1898 ) and develops the first effective bronchodilator . `` In the 1960s , asthma researchers discovered that asthma is an inflammatory disease , not just constriction of the airways , and that asthma sufferers have a sensitive immune system which reacts to airborne allergens . The first inhaled anti-inflammatory medication is born . `` In 1972 , inhaled corticosteroids hit the market . `` - Fraser Health",0

"What 's the best diet to loose weith in 1 month ? ? i need to loose some weith ! Any minding of the fat & calories , coupled with adequate exercise , will help you drop a little something.Increase your activity . Start walking , jogging , or biking for 30-60 minutes at least 3 or 4 times a week.Drink like a camel . I try to drink about 15 glasses of water a day , plus coffee ( the extra water is to counter the caffeine dehydration ) .Use a calorie-free sweetener instead of sugar . Try to be active in the morning , and try to eat breakfast . Both will kick-start your metabolism.Get adequate sleep.If you 're a carb addict like me ( bread , pasta , etc . ) , opt for whole grains . I eat whole grain cheerios for breakfast , and use 1 % milk . 1-3 times a day , I eat buttered vegetables ( California or Italian Style frozen vegetable mix from Wal-Mart : 25 calories per serving ) .If you like kool-aid or other sweet drinks , try fruit2o ( fruity water ) , Propel ( fruity water by gatorade ) , or CRYSTAL LIGHT drink mixes . I once traded in my kool-aid for crystal light while I was pregnant , and did n't gain any weight between visits with my doctor.If you want a little help , go invest in a good OTC diet pill like TrimSPA or Propolene . I do n't recommend Stackers , but that 's only because I do n't know many people who can take stimulants the way I do . DO NOT take more than the recommended dosage , and do n't take them too late in the day , or you wo n't sleep.And last ... COMMIT to changing your lifestyle , NOT just dropping a few pounds for whatever happens in a month , and thinking it 's going to be forever . If you can not commit , then do not complain .",0

"how does computer work ? A computer is an information-processing machine that works by converting all kinds of information into binary numbers ( ones and zeros ) and then using simple mathematics to make decisions about , or to rearrange , those numbers . There are two things essential to understanding the basics of how a computer works . One is that a computer treats any type of information ( not only numbers but also letters , words , dates , and so on ) as if it consisted simply of binary ones and zeros . For example , a computer can translate the letter “ A ” typed into its keyboard into a string of ones and zeros , such as 1000001 . One reason to do this is that once in binary form , the information can be stored and moved about more easily .",0
"who is Azazel in the Bible ? Azazel in LeviticusLeviticus 16:8 tells that the Lord ordered his high priest , Aaron , to 'place lots upon the two goats , one marked for the Lord and the other marked for Azazel ' on the Jewish Day of Atonement . The goat designated by lot for the Lord is to be used as a sin offering , while the goat designated for Azazel `` shall be left standing alive before the Lord , to make expiation with it and to send it off to the wilderness for Azazel . '' ( Lev 16:10 ) Aaron was to `` lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities and transgressions of the Israelites , whatever their sins , putting them on the head of the goat ; and it shall be sent off to the wilderness through a designated an . Thus the goat shall carry on it all their iniquities to an inaccessible region ; and the goat shall be set free in the wilderness . '' ( Lev 16:21-22 ) Leviticus also says that `` He who set the Azazel-goat free shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water ; after that he may reenter the camp . '' ( 16:26 ) From this passage in Leviticus , it would seem that Azazel is conceived of as a personal being , as lots were drawn for the Lord and for him . Also , Leviticus mentions that Azazel lives in the wilderness , as do the Se'irim . Because of this ritual , Azazel is known as the `` scapegoat . '' The goat that is sent to Azazel is not as a sacrifice , but as a symbol that there is no longer any unexpiated guilt . Both the goat and the man who leads away the goat are unclean , and the only way the man can reenter the camp is by washing his clothes and bathing . Azazel in the Apocalypse of AbrahamIn the Apocalypse of Abraham , Azazel is portrayed as an unclean bird which came down upon the sacrifice which Abraham prepared . This is in reference to Genesis 15:11 `` Birds of prey came down upon the carcasses , and Abram drove them away . '' `` And the unclean bird spoke to me and said , 'What are you doing , Abraham , on the holy heights , where no one eats of drinks , nor is there upon them food for men . But these all will be consumed by fire and ascend to the height , they will destroy you . ' And it came to pass when I saw the bird speaking I said this to the angel : 'What is this , my lord ? ' And he said , 'This is disgrace , this is Azazel ! ' And he said to him , 'Shame on you Azazel ! For Abraham 's portion is in heaven , and yours is on earth , for you have selected here , ( and ) become enamored of the dwelling place of your blemish . Therefore the Eternal Ruler , the Mighty One , has given you a dwelling on earth . Through you the all-evil spirit ( is ) a liar , and through you ( are ) wrath and trials on the generations of men who live impiously . '' - Apocalypse of Abraham 13:4-9The Apocalypse of Abraham also associates Azazel with Hell . Abraham says to him `` May you be the firebrand of the furnace of the earth ! Go , Azazel , into the untrodden parts of the earth . For your heritage is over those who are with you '' ( 14:5-6 ) There is also the idea that God 's heritage ( the created world ) is largely under the dominion of evil . It is `` shared with Azazel '' ( 20:5 ) Azazel is also identified with the serpent which tempted Eve . His form is described as a dragon with `` hands and feet like a man 's , on his back six wings on the right and six on the left . '' ( 23:7 ) Finally , the Apocalypse of Abraham says that the wicked will `` putrefy in the belly of the crafty worm Azazel , and be burned by the fire of Azazel 's tongue . '' ( 31:5 ) Here again , there is another reference to Azazel as being Hell .",0

"why does it feel good to kill brain cells ? should n't that feel bad ? First of all most of the substances that are widely believed to kill brain cells do not . They will however alter the chemistry of the brain . This is not to say that it 's good to do these things . It is mostly due to the anti drug histeria that began in the early 20th century . Most drugs were used as medicine in the early days . It 's when drug abuse occurs that it can be of such a detriment . You can do very real damage to your brain with some of the most widely used drugs available today , alcohol among them . But it is the inhalants that do the damage the fastest . They impart chemical compounds into the bloodstream instead of Oxygen . Thus the brain is robbed of its most vital element . Brain cells then die by the millions . The notion that you become brain damaged by using marijuana or opiates is a bit misleading . The balance of normal brain chemicals is altered , maybe forever , but they are still not killing brain cells . Cocaine is another drug commonly used . It effects the brain chemistry also , but is more damaging to the heart . It kills heart cells on contact in laboratory experiments . It may also be harmful due to the powerful solvents it contains as a residue leftover from its manufacturing process . If you are going to use these substances you should at least inform yourself as to the damage you 're doing to your body .",0

"What is the best music creation software to use for a windows xp computer ? I want a computer program that lets me make new songs by adding beats and sounds and lets me make remixes to songs from my library on my computer . It depends on how much you want to program your own sounds verus leveraging pre-canned loops and samples culled from the songs you want to remix.I 'm still a big fan of Acid -- - Orignally from Sonic Foundry but now a product offered by Sony Music : http : //www.sonymediasoftware.com/products/acidfamily.aspAcid is excellent for working with loops -- it allows you to easily time-stretch loops and transpose them to work well with other loops culled from other sources . A lot of what makes people love Garageband ( Apple 's entry-level music software ) was first pioneered in Acid . The main limitation of Acid is that it has limited or no support for the creation of your own original sounds and sequences -- it 's more of a loop arranger.Another outstanding application is Propellerheads Reason 3.0 ( http : //www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/ ) Reaon gives you an entire virtual rack of synthesizers , samplers , and effects that you can intuitively connect with virtual patch cables . Every knob is designed to be twiddled in real time and the best thing is that all these modifications can be recorded for playback or fine-tuning.Finally , a third application you might want to check out is Ableton Live ( http : //www.ableton.com/index.php ? main=live ) Live is extremely popular among performing musicians today because it is optimized for live performance or on-the-fly creation/arranging of songs . The application is a bit like Acid in that it is mainly intended for working with building blocks of pre-created loops ( either instrument loops or sampled material ) with an interface and workflow that makes it very easy to add , subtract , and tweak stuff as the rest of the song plays back . Between the 3 applications I 'm sure you 'll find something that work for you . Best of all , you can download free trial versions of all applications to see for yourself . Happy remixing !",0
"how could i install program to other drive ? It depends on the program.Most professional programs will allow you to choose between a CUSTOM INSTALL and an Express Install . If so , choose CUSTOM INSTALL . This will allow you to choose program features to install and , usually , the installation folder . For the installation folder , there will usually be a BROWSE button . Click on that and select the drive and folder for the installation.If there is n't a CUSTOM INSTALL choice , you still might be presented with a default folder and a BROWSE button . Click on the BROWSE button and select the drive and folder you want to use.NOTE : Most programs allow you to type in your own folder name , even if it does n't already exist . These programs will usually tell you the folder does n't exist and ask your permission to create the folder . Click YES or OK to create the folder.I highly suggest that you keep a well-organized naming scheme throughout your use of the computer.EXAMPLE : I have a C : & # 92 ; Program Files & # 92 ; under which I have a lot of program folders . I also have a D : & # 92 ; Program Files & # 92 ; with program folders under that ( this is where I put utilities and small applications ) . Finally , I have an E : & # 92 ; Program Files & # 92 ; with program folders under that ( this is where I install games ) .",0

"Why Were The Days of the Week Named After The Solar System ? I was just curious . I know that Sunday is named after the Sun . Monday=Moon , Tuesday=Mars , Wed.=Mercury , Thur.=Jupiter , Friday=Venus , & Sat.=Saturn ... But why exactly ? . Was it believed that those days revolved around each of those planets at that time ? or what ? Thanks . A long time ago in human history , people thought that Earth was flat , and at the universe 's center . They believed that seven members of the solar system forever circled around us—see graphic to the right , or view one from Censorinus - Sur le jour natal . Some Mediterranian peoples also believed that each hour of the day was ruled by either the Sun , Moon or one of five then-known planets , all of which were thought of as gods . The sequence in which they thought hours were governed was the inverse order of distance they believed those solar system objects to be from Earth . During this time , Egyptians thought that the most distant was Saturn , shown at the bottom of the graphic above . They thought that the order of closer members ( shown counterclockwise following Saturn ) was Jupiter , Mars , Sun , Venus , Mercury and closest , the Moon . So they believed that the first hour was ruled by Saturn , the second by Jupiter and so on . Egyptians also believed that after each seven hours the order in which these objects ruled was repeated , so it started again with Saturn . According to those ancient Egyptians , the planet that ruled the first hour also governed the entire twenty-four hour period , and gave its name to that day . The first ( and also the 8th , 15th and 22nd ) hours of the first day were sacred to Saturn , the 23rd to Jupiter , the 24th to Mars and the first hour of the next day to the Sun . Therefore , they believed that the first day was ruled by and named after Saturn ( Saturday ) and the second was ruled by ( and named after ) the Sun ( Sunday ) . Egyptians once divided all twelve 30-day months ( of their 360-day calendar year ) into three 10-day weeks in the same manner as Greeks of the same period . The epoch at which planet worship caused them to change its length to seven days is not known , but it must have been over twenty-five hundred years ago because Herodotus , writing in his History during the 5th century B.C . said : `` Here are some other discoveries of the Egyptians . They find ... each day belongs to a god ... '' Adherents of the cult of Sin at Harran , who were known as Harranians or Sabeans by Arabic and Syrian authors , named their days after the same solar system members as Egyptians and Persians . Like Hebrews and many other peoples , they considered the one named after Saturn to be the seventh day , so they began their week with a day named after the Sun . All seven days were named after solar system members in the same order as they were in Egypt . It is interesting to note that these exact same solar system objects , and in the same sequence , were also used to name days in ancient India , Tibet and Burma . This is also true of names for Japanese days of the week , but the custom there has been traced back only a thousand years . Roman soldiers stationed in Egypt became accustomed to the pagan seven-day week and began to introduce it into their own homeland to replace their eight-day marketing week . Octavian ( Caesar Augustus ) and succeeding Roman rulers permitted this practice but it was n't made official until the emperor Constantine took that step in A.D. 321 . English names for days of the week are derived from Anglo-Saxon names for those same seven heavenly bodies that were revered by ancient peoples . Compare those English and Anglo-Saxon day names in the table below . Other similarities between day and `` planet '' names in various countries can be observed there .",0

"Would you ever want to attend the Super Bowl ? Why or why not ? I most likely would never want to attend the Super Bowl for three reasons . First , the cost . The cost of one Super Bowl ticket is expensive and with the money that I could pay for one Super Bowl ticket , I could purchase a High Definition Television . Second , I would have to deal with a lot of crowds at the event . Although it would be a dream to attend the Major League Baseball All-Star Game but with the Super Bowl , you have to get to the game early and there is going to be more people attending a Super Bowl than a baseball All-Star Game . Finally , it might be more expensive to attend at Super Bowl after you pay for accommodations for about three day and attending all the Super Bowl events that the host city has to offer . If I ever did want to attend the Super Bowl , I would like to see the Super Bowl in Detroit , Atlanta , Chicago , and in Cleveland . Yes if the Redskins were in it .",0

"Is ice made from a salt/water solution actually colder than just water ice ? If you put both solutions in the kitchen freezer would the salt ice be colder than the water one , or would the salt solution stay liquid ? If you were able to get the salt solution cold enough , it would freeze . However , if you put two ice trays side by side , one filled with water , the other filled with salt water , and chilled them to the point where both froze , the would both be the same temperature . However , once the cold was taken away , the salt solution would melt at a much lower temperature than the water only cubes.What salt does when added to water is decrease the temperature at which water will freeze -- as well as melt . How much the freezing/melting point is lowered depends on how much salt is added . The higher the concentration , the lower the freezing/melting point .",0

I would strongly challenge the 18-year-old ( or older ) who would even talk with you , other than standard polite social acknowledgement . Someone who would provide mentorship is an obvious exception , but that is not how I understand the nature of the question . Since this question is in the `` Love and Romance '' category , it is obvious that something more would ultimately be sought from such contacts from one or both of the peoplpe involved . I would challenge the older person regarding his or her mental state , morals and ethics , primary relationships , and boundary issues , as well as remind him or her that any intimate action could verily easily be legally argued as statuatory rape . With all due respect to Diva4167 , I would also be concerned about the younger person 's primary relationships , as well as the fact that people of that age can be very fickle . Someone who can seem to be very special one day can seem horrible the next , because he or she is acting perfectly normally , but not within a set of ideals . 16 is the age to drive , 18 is the age of majority , and 21 is the legal drinking age . Those are the boundaries that this society has set , and there are consequences for blurring them .

If you are serious about this , please just pose the question once , review the answers , and be done with it . Be well .",0

"What is the differance between devil worshipping and satanism ? Satanism is a religious , semi-religious and/or philosophical movement whose adherents recognize Satan as an archetype , pre-cosmic force , or some aspect of human nature . Although named for Satan , a name associated with evil and temptation , Satanism is more commonly the name given to certain spiritual paths which emphasize the Left-Hand Path , as opposed to the much more common Right-Hand Path . Left-Handers believe in spiritual enrichment through their own work on themselves , and that ultimately they are answerable only to themselves , while Right-Handers believe in spiritual enrichment through the dissolution or submission of the self to ( or into ) something greater . Many Satanists do not in fact worship a deity called Satan , or necessarily any other deity , nor do they follow a principle of evil . This aspect of their beliefs is very commonly misunderstood.This is very different to people who worship Satan , these are usually emotionally immature people , because obviously satan does n't want to be worshipped by the creatures he despises .",0

"why there is 28 days on Feburary ? February is the second month of the year in the Gregorian Calendar . It is the shortest Gregorian month and the only month with the length of 28 or 29 days . The month has 29 days in leap years , when the year number is divisible by four ( except for years that are divisible by 100 and not by 400 ) . In other years the month has 28 days.February begins , astronomically speaking , with the sun in the constellation of Capricornus and ends with the sun in the constellation of Aquarius . Astrologically speaking , February begins with the sun in the sign of Aquarius and ends in the sign of Pisces.February was named for the Roman god Februus , the god of purification . January and February were the last two months to be added to the Roman calendar , since the Romans originally considered winter a monthless period . This change was made by Numa Pompilius about 700 BC in order to bring the calendar in line with a standard lunar year . Numa 's Februarius contained 29 days ( 30 in a leap year ) . Augustus is alleged to have removed one day from February and added it to August , ( renamed from Sextilis to honor himself ) , so that Julius Caesar 's July would not contain more days . However there is little historical evidence to support this claim.February was nominally the last month of the Roman calendar , as the year originally began in March . At certain intervals Roman priests inserted an intercalary month , Mercedonius , after February to realign the year with the seasons.Historical names for February include the Anglo-Saxon terms Solmoneth ( mud month ) and Kale-monath ( named for cabbage ) as well as Charlemagne 's designation Hornung . In old Japanese calendar , the month is called Kisaragi ( 如月 , 絹更月 or 衣更月 ) . It is sometimes also called Mumetsuki ( 梅見月 ) or Konometsuki ( 木目月 ) . In Finnish , the month is called helmikuu , meaning `` month of the pearl '' .February is recognized as Black History Month in the United States and Canada . `` February '' is pronounced without the first r , as `` Febuary '' , by many speakers . This is probably elision , or an analogical change influenced by `` January '' .",0

"How do I make my girlfriend feel better ?

She looks like she 's going to have a breakdown soon.This actually started when she applied early decision to Standford and got rejected .

If she is like me , she just needs time alone to focus and not feel like she needs to pay attention to other 's needs right now . I bet she is a very giving person . She is being too hard on herself , though . Stress will make you say and do silly things . Maybe if you sent her a love letter telling her how much you love her and admire her strength and abilities . Let her know you are behind her 100 % and ca n't wait to see her get into a college . Tell her you are proud of her for working so hard . Just basically do all you can to boost her up and make her feel special . Send the letter ( hand written ! ) through regular mail . For some reason , and hand written love letter is always the best thing in the world to cheer up a gal ! Good luck .",0

"What is a less toxic alternative to Chemo therapy for breast cancer treatment in a woman ? To be honest , chemotherapy is not a cancer treatment . Here is the situation . Chemo can take care of the problem right away , but the doctor always says that , some can live an extended 2 years , or 3 years . And some die right away from the chemicals . This is with late stages of cancer . Now , for early stages , it helps the problem but your health is deteriorated . They say that chemo affects the cancer and your normal body cells . How many people you know , who have had late stages of cancer , and lived through it pass 5 yours with chemo therapy ? I bet you that you have never even heard of it . Even if someone has , how many people is that compared to that masses ? The problem with other medicines is that the pharmaceautical companies can not control that product . What if it was tree bark say for instance . How many people do you know will buy the pills if they can just walk up to any tree and bite a piece off to save themselves ? See ? So , USA doctors are familiar with these remedies , but they do not talk about it . Try asking your doctor about green algae , or cesium chloride , or paw paw , etc etc . Then they start to talk . Otherwise , they wont say a word . And if you dont know , how can you ask ? So , the doctors lips are sealed tight . The individual doctors on the other hand are sometimes scared to talk about it . It is because , if they open their mouths , they would be facing the whole medical community . Alot of them go into the medical field to help people , and some go in it for money . But , the top ranking ones in control are all in it for money . If not , they would have never gotten their position . I do not suggest you go with chemo therapy . You can look up some alternative medicine to cancer and they are all over the place on the net . The best ranked one is cesium chloride , paw paw , and along with others . Some health websites even have a place where you can go and tell them your stage of cancer and which type of cancer , and they will sell you a package based on your individual problem . There are also some doctors scattered all over the USA who specialize in cancer . You never hear about them right ? Well , they wont be bothered by the medical community if they do a small operation without much advertising . But , they all report about 90 % survival rates on cancers that regular cancer doctors give up on . And if that doctor didnt give up , do you expect to live anyways ? No . I speak out to you because I dont want you to die like the two of my friends who have already died . Certain doctors even said that they could cure it with 80 % survival rate . But , I didnt have the money to help them . So , I am speaking out in hopes that nothing happens to you and you survive . Regardless of your stage of cancer . Cesium chloride is what works best . Look it up , its everywhere . Even oxygen drops help . You can use them both at the same time . The thing is with these alternatives is that , some of them make you feel extremely bad at the beginning , but after a while you get used to it , and then you are gone with the cancer before you know it . So dont feel discouraged . Oxygen drops keep cancer from growing because your body can live with more oxygen . As a matter of fact , it helps circulate your blood . Cancer can not live at the sight of oxygen . It has been said that not enough oxygen is what causes cancer . I dont know what the cause is , because there are many causes . But , cesium chloride and oxygen drops will take care of it . And one more thing , some of these remedies can not be sold as a cancer treatment . So , they are sold as vitamins . But , in their website , they are allowed to say what it cures . But , their labels can not say a word about cancer . So , you should start in the vitamin section of the internet . Good luck my friend .",0

"I believe oral sex is OK between a husband and wife if both are comfortable with it.What do u think ? Song of Solomon chapter 4 and 5 is about oral sex and its told through a metaphor , if you do n't think so read it for yourself.There 's another place that says between a man and his wife the bed is undefiled , which means anything goes as long as they are both comfortable with it . The Bible only states that you should be married . If there is no specific stop signs in scripture , here is what you do . Pray first , then make love . If you feel comfortable and closer to your mate , go for it . There is a great book titled `` Sheet Music '' that really helps find maximum enjoyment in the marriage bed . I highly recommend it.http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/0842360247",0

"Should I get a Master 's in Special Education or Public Policy ? I enjoy both fields . I currently have a bachelor 's in Finance , a field I 'm not too interested in.In the past I had a two year internship with my State Senator and a 1 year job as a special ed instructional assistant . I enjoyed both positions.Paying for it is not too much of a problem either as the state offers loan reimbursements for special ed teachers and the school of public policy is offering generous scholarships.So perhaps it comes down to job availability . There is definately a big need for special ed teachers . I do n't know how easy it is to get a legislative job however , although if it is possible I may really enjoy it.What do you think ? While public policy is an undoubedly exciting field , the rewards you 'll get and receive in special education are certainly among the most satisfying available.You have an opportunity to positively affect countless children and adults with challenges far beyond the average person .

"How many jumps are there in each set of volleyball match for each player ? At lower levels of play , e.g. , recreational leagues , the number of jumps varies by the player 's ability . The best players ( on recreational teams ) gets the lion-share of the sets , and thus , jumps a lot more than others . The ratio between best and worst players on the court could mean 25 jumps to zero . Additionally , the offense usually consists of `` high outside '' sets , with no `` quick attack '' in the middle , and thus , reduced the number of jumps required to block . However , at higher levels of play , the number of jumps varies by position more than ability . The least number of jumps go the outside hitters , both power and weak-side ( a/k/a , `` opposite '' ) . Their numbers are roughly inverses of each other , for obvious positional reasons . Figure 9-12 spike attempts for power hitters , and 4-7 blocks ; the opposite hitter gets the opposite numbers : 4-7 spike attempts , and 9-12 spikes . The lion-share of jumps go to the middle hitters , who ( usually ) jump on every volley , because they need to jump before the setter sets the ball . Additionally , they participate in every block . Figure they get about 12-25 spike jumps , and the same number of blocks . Hope this very un-scientific answer helps .",0

"How do I raise my credit score fast and without paying some company to erase stuff off my report ? Basic but effective tequniques or tricks if you know them . If someone asks you for money to increase your score , it is true that they are likely to be a thief , however , it is NOT TRUE that you can not raise your score . Your credit score is primarily affected by a few things . First , any time that you make a late payment , even one that is only 30 days late , that will effect your score as much as 50 points the first month . It will climb slowly each month thereafter if you pay on time . So , do n't ever pay late . Secondly , a large part of your score is determined by the ratio of credit used to credit available . If you have a $ 1,000 limit on your card , DO NOT leave a balance on that card of over $ 500 . The lower your credit debt to credit limits , the better your score will be . Lastly , the longer you have credit , the better . Some people will cancel cards and accounts that are infrequently used . Do n't do that ! Leave them open . On the other hand , having too many credit accounts means you are a credit hog . Every time you apply for credit , your score will go down , for a few months .",0

"how did francis crick and james watson try to understand dna ? well people at that time were obsessed with finding what the key to life was and Watson and Crick took the data from other scientists who were studying the same subject , they analyzed the data from Cargraff 's studies about how A only pairs with T and C with G. They also looked at x-rays made by Rosiland Franklin . They also looked at data produced by Maurice Wilkins ( read more in source sites ) So basicly watson and crick took other peoples data and compiled it to produce the double helix model , since the other people were not working with each other each had a piece of the puzzle but could not completely decipher DNA .",0

"any one know the reason why people say 'bless you ' after you sneeze ? I do it all the time and have no idea why . THIS IS THE ORIGIN OF THE CUSTOM : In English-speaking countries , it is common for at least one person to say `` Bless you '' after someone sneezes . The traditional explaination for the custom is that it began literally as a blessing . Pope Gregory I the Great ( 540-604 AD ) ascended to the Papacy just in time for the start of the plague in 590 AD ( his successor succumbed to it ) . To combat the plague Gregory ordered litanies , processions and unceasing prayer for God 's intercession . When someone sneezed , they were immediately blessed ( `` God bless you ! '' ) in the hope that they would not subsequently develop the plague.This custom persists among speakers of many languages . Common social responses to sneezes in English include `` Bless you '' and `` Gesundheit '' ( German , `` [ Good ] health [ to you ] '' ) .",0

"Why do Life Savers candy make blue sparks when you bite them ? It works the best with `` Wintogreen , '' rather than peppermint , and should be done with a fresh pack ( the moisture makes it spark better ) . The spark that comes from the Life Saver is considered as a type of triboluminescence , which the sugar in Life Savers contain . Here 's an excerpt from my source site : `` Wintergreen sparking , it 's believed , is actually a three-step process . Step One : When you shatter the sugar crystals with your teeth , electrons ( which are negatively charged ) break free . As a result , the atoms in which the electrons were formerly embedded become positively charged . In what amounts to a subatomic game of musical chairs , the free electrons dash around madly trying to find a new home . `` Step Two : Meanwhile , as the sugar crystals disintegrate , nitrogen molecules from the air attach themselves to the fractured surfaces . When the free electrons strike the nitrogen molecules , they cause the latter to emit invisible ultraviolet radiation , along with a faint visible glow . `` Step Three : The UV radiation is absorbed by the wintergreen flavoring , methyl salicylate . This then emits the fairly bright blue light you see . Pretty complicated , I admit . Clearly the planners in the Pentagon were n't the first to be obsessed with high-tech gimcracks . ''",0

"why are the the forcasts on tv weather almost never the same ? Different TV stations use different weather services for their weather forecasts.Some use Accuweather . Some use the National Weather Service . Others may use the Weather Channel as their source.Each of these services use different computer models and different human beings interpreting the results of these models to create their forecasts.When I go skiing near Lake Tahoe , I go with the National Weather Service because their predictions seem the most accurate and they include weather predictions about the snow level .

"can sata and pata raid work at the same time , so in `` my computer '' all the drives show up as a single space ? If you mean , can you combine both SATA and PATA drives in a single RAID , then the answer is yes , but not a hardware RAID.There are two kinds of RAID -- hardware and software . Hardware RAID is implemented by a hardware RAID controller , which is either part of your motherboard , or an add-in card . Software RAID is implemented by the operating system . Software RAID is slower than hardware RAID , but if you have a reasonably fast processor , it 's not using terribly much slower . If you have a slow processor , it will be slower , and more importantly , it will put a big load on your processor and make everything run slowly.To the best of my knowledge , there are no RAID controllers that will RAID an SATA drive with a PATA drive , but you can set up whatever RAID you want with software RAID . If you already have your drives in hardware RAID ( and intend to keep them that way ) then when you do this , you will be RAIDing the already-existing hardware RAIDs , since a hardware RAID is treated as a single drive on the `` software level '' .Here 's some info on software RAID in Windows : http : //www.techimo.com/articles/index.pl ? photo=149Here 's some info on software RAID in GNU/Linux : http : //www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.htmlHere 's some info on software RAID in Mac OS X : http : //www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/softraid3.htmlYou can find abundant info on doing software RAID on these and other operating systems by entering `` software RAID '' together with name of the operating system in a search engine .",0

"What the meaning of `` CALIFORNIA `` ? In the greek language `` CALI `` means `` NICE `` Some suggest that the word California may signify that a place is `` hot as an oven '' ( cali > hot , fornia > oven ) . It may be derived from caliente fornalia , Spanish for hot furnace , or it may come from calida fornax , Latin for hot climate.Another possible source may be kali forno , an indigenous phrase meaning `` high mountains '' . There is no agreement among scholars.The name California comes from a mythical Spanish island ruled by a queen called Califia that was featured in a Spanish romance ( `` Las Sergas de Esplandian '' ) written by Garcia Ordonez de Montalvo in 1510 . The Spanish explorers originally thought that California was an island .",0

"Men do you perfer thick girls over skinney girls or skinney girls over thick girls ? Tell me with a little detail so I can really undserstand your reasons . Tell me the benefits of your preference . I myself prefer skinney girls over thick girls because I am skinny . Skinney girls also tend to be more fit unless they are too skinney . Thicker girls are usually fat . The things I like to do might not be able to be done by a thicker girl . To me skinner girls are hotter . You can check out their figure . However with thicker girls their figure is , um , sometimes lumpy and such ; not as pleasing to look at . Personality is also important when it comes to this subject unless you 're looking for a quick hook-up . It just so happens that the smartest girls that have really good personalitys are also the hottest-it 's the best of both worlds . Thicker girls could work-out to lose weight if they want . I like to go mountain biking so if a thicker girl found that out and asked to come of course I would want her to and then anything could happen after that . There are some people that prefer thicker girls . I hope this answer helps you understand .",0

Have a complete integrated system– A complete system includes both planning and executionmanagement.– Plan will change but to fail to plan in planning to fail.– Changes and variability are expected events .

"My son has a math problem that I need to show him an alternate method of answering . Algebra formula please. ? `` The Monsters of Muzz '' opened on Monday . The first day there were 25 people who saw the movie . Word got out and on the second day 17 more people came than on the first day , so that 67 people had seen the movie after the second day . On the third day 59 people came , 17 more than on the second day . If each day 17 more people saw the movie than the day before , on what day would 500 people have seen the movie ? He solved it by adding adding , I want to give him a better way . The sum of the first N numbers is known to be : 1 + 2 + ... + N = N ( N+1 ) /2 ( Gauss formula ) If we write the values for N = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , ... we obtain the sequence:1 , 3 , 6 , 10 , 15 , 21 , 28 , 36 , 45 , 55 , ...

"important events during george washingtons presidency ? Key Event : America Signs Treaty with Tripoli.Some more Key Events in President George Washington 's Administration• Precedents -- -Washington established two main precedents : a cabinet and the two-year term.• Whiskey Rebellion , 1794 -- -Washington ordered 15,000 troops to Pennsylvania and crushed the first challenge to federal authority.• Farewell Address , 1796 -- -Washington warned against the evils of political parties and `` tangling alliances '' abroad . On April 30 , 1789 , George Washington , standing on the balcony of Federal Hall on Wall Street in New York , took his oath of office as the first President of the United States . `` As the first of every thing , in our situation will serve to establish a Precedent , '' he wrote James Madison , `` it is devoutly wished on my part , that these precedents may be fixed on true principles . '' Born in 1732 into a Virginia planter family , he learned the morals , manners , and body of knowledge requisite for an 18th century Virginia gentleman . He pursued two intertwined interests : military arts and western expansion . At 16 he helped survey Shenandoah lands for Thomas , Lord Fairfax . Commissioned a lieutenant colonel in 1754 , he fought the first skirmishes of what grew into the French and Indian War . The next year , as an aide to Gen. Edward Braddock , he escaped injury although four bullets ripped his coat and two horses were shot from under him . From 1759 to the outbreak of the American Revolution , Washington managed his lands around Mount Vernon and served in the Virginia House of Burgesses . Married to a widow , Martha Dandridge Custis , he devoted himself to a busy and happy life . But like his fellow planters , Washington felt himself exploited by British merchants and hampered by British regulations . As the quarrel with the mother country grew acute , he moderately but firmly voiced his resistance to the restrictions . When the Second Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia in May 1775 , Washington , one of the Virginia delegates , was elected Commander in Chief of the Continental Army . On July 3 , 1775 , at Cambridge , Massachusetts , he took command of his ill-trained troops and embarked upon a war that was to last six grueling years . He realized early that the best strategy was to harass the British . He reported to Congress , `` we should on all Occasions avoid a general Action , or put anything to the Risque , unless compelled by a necessity , into which we ought never to be drawn . '' Ensuing battles saw him fall back slowly , then strike unexpectedly . Finally in 1781 with the aid of French allies -- he forced the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown . Washington longed to retire to his fields at Mount Vernon . But he soon realized that the Nation under its Articles of Confederation was not functioning well , so he became a prime mover in the steps leading to the Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia in 1787 . When the new Constitution was ratified , the Electoral College unanimously elected Washington President He did not infringe upon the policy making powers that he felt the Constitution gave Congress . But the determination of foreign policy became preponderantly a Presidential concern . When the French Revolution led to a major war between France and England , Washington refused to accept entirely the recommendations of either his Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson , who was pro-French , or his Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton , who was pro-British . Rather , he insisted upon a neutral course until the United States could grow stronger . To his disappointment , two parties were developing by the end of his first term . Wearied of politics , feeling old , he retired at the end of his second . In his Farewell Address , he urged his countrymen to forswear excessive party spirit and geographical distinctions . In foreign affairs , he warned against long-term alliances . Washington enjoyed less than three years of retir",0

"how do you remve genital warts ? thank you ? What are Condyloma ? Condylomata acuminata or genital warts are fleshy growths which appear in the genital area . They are caused by HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS ( HPV ) and are usually spread by sexual contact . Symptoms and Diagnosis . Genital warts first appear as small pink or red bumps on the vulva ( lips of the vagina ) , vagina , cervix , penis shaft , urinary opening or rectum . They are usually painless , but some people may have itching , burning or slight bleeding from these areas . The time between exposure to the virus and the appearance of warts is not known . It could be anywhere from several weeks to several years before symptoms occur . Because of this , it is had to tell when and where you were exposed to the virus . Sometimes vaginal infections and pregnancy can cause warts to grow and spread . One study showed that 20 % of women with genital warts also had a vaginal infection . Unless that infection is treated , the warts may not go away . Warts may spread up inside the vagina and on the cervix . They may also cause abnormal Pap smears . During pregnancy warts may be treated so they do not spread or grow larger . In men , warts may spread inside the penis causing problems when they urinate . The diagnosis of condylomata acuminata is usually made by a health care provider simply inspecting the genital area . Occasionally , they may want to remove a wart and send it to the lab for further tests . Because genital warts are a sexually transmitted disease other tests may be done for other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea , Chlamydia , syphilis , HIV and hepatitis . Treatment.Genital warts are frustrating for you to have and frustrating for doctors to treat . Some warts will disappear on their own . Others may come and go despite vigorous treatment . One of the most important things you can do is to KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENTS ! The treatment is easier when the warts are small and few in number . There is no one magic treatment for genital warts . Many methods may be tried depending on where , how large and how long the warts have been there . Certain chemicals may be applied to smaller warts on moist areas . The most common chemical used is called TRICHLOROACETIC ACID ( TCA ) . TCA is a clear , watery liquid that is painted on the warts . It causes a burning sensation as it dries . The warts will turn a whitish color , shrink and disappear . It will take weekly treatments for a number of weeks to get rid of the warts . Another chemical , PODOPHYLLIN , is a brown liquid that may also be used . It also causes a burning sensation as it dries . It must be washed off with soap and water 4 to 6 hours after it has been applied . In certain circumstances , a preparation of this medication may be applied by the patient at home . If TCA and PODOPHYLLIN do not work , the doctor may try freezing the wart with a treatment called CRYOTHERAPY , treating the affected area with topical 5FU CREAM , or performing laser surgery . Occasionally , INTERFERON injections are used if all other methods of treatment have failed . None of the treatments mentioned here are a guarantee that the warts will never come back . Once the wart virus ( HPV ) is in the skin , genital warts may occur again and again . This may require numerous visits to the doctor and many months of treatment . We know this can be very discouraging , but remember -- warts are easier to treat when they are small and few in number . KEEP THOSE APPOINTMENTS ! If the condyloma do not respond to treatment , your doctor may refer you to the Colposcopy Clinic . There your vulva or cervix will be examined through a special scope that magnifies the area . Tissue samples ( biopsies ) may be taken for further study . The doctors can then recommend further treatment options . PreventionThere are two ways to prevent getting warts : Use condoms during sex . Protect yourself . Celibacy - not having sex . If you have warts : Avoid sexual contact during treatment . If your warts are recurrent or you have a",0

"how are ionic solids formed ? Ionic solids are indeed formed by a gain and loss of electrons . More specifically , they are formed by a chemical reaction between a metal atom and a nonmetal atom . For example , sodium , a metal , has a tendency to want to lose an electron , and bromine , a nonmetal , wants to gain an electron , so the sodium gives an electron to bromin ( which is now called bromide ) . Now sodium has lost an electron , which is negatively charged , so it has a net charge of 1+ . Bromine has gained an electron , so it has a net charge of -1 . Since they are oppositely charged , they are attracted to each other ( kind of like how opposite poles of magnets are atracted to each other ) , they ionically bond and become an ionic solid ( also known as a salt ) .",0

"What is a `` chimera '' in terms of human reproduction ? Hint : has to do with prenatal twins . A chimera is an animal which has ( at least ) two different populations of cells , which are genetically distinct and which originated in different zygotes ( fertilized eggs ) . Chimeras are named after the mythological creature Chimera.Chimerism may occur naturally during pregnancy , when two non-identical twins combine in the womb , at a very early stage of development , to form a single organism . Such an organism is called a tetragametic chimera as it is formed from four gametes—two eggs and two sperm . As the organism develops , the resulting chimera can come to possess organs that have different sets of chromosomes . For example , the chimera may have a liver composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a kidney composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes . This has occurred in humans , though it is considered extremely rare , but since it can only be detected through DNA testing , which in itself is rare , it may be more common than currently believed . As of 2003 , there were about 30 human cases in the literature , according to New Scientist.In biological research , chimeras are artificially produced by mixing cells from two different organisms . This can result in the eventual development of an adult animal composed of cells from both donors , which may be of different species—for example , in 1984 a chimeric geep was produced by combining embryos from a goat and a sheep . A chicken with a quail 's brain has been produced by grafting portions of a quail embryo into a chicken embryo.In August 2003 , researchers at the Shanghai Second Medical University in China reported that they had successfully fused human skin cells and rabbit eggs to create the first human chimeric embryos . The embryos were allowed to develop for several days in a laboratory setting , then destroyed to harvest the resulting stem cells . Increasingly realizable projects using part-human , part-animal chimeras as living factories for producing cells or organs raise a host of ethical and safety issues.Chimeras should not be confused with hybrids , which are organisms formed from two gametes ( each from a different species ) which formed a single zygote . All cells in a hybrid originate from this single zygote . For example , a mule is a hybrid created from the sperm of a donkey and the egg of a horse.Chimeras should also not be confused with mosaics , which are organisms with genetically different cell types , but which again originate from a single zygote .",0

Try 96 kbit/s and see if you notice a difference . ( This will be found in the recording media ; ie . the program that `` rips '' CD to mp3 . ) Again 128 is standard for not noticing quality loss . VBR is a good choice . It breaks the songs into segments so that low quality sections can have lower bit rate . Set VBR from 96-128 .",0
"Why do people ask you `` how are you ? '' When they do n't really care ? Not all people ask that . In Malaysia they ask `` Where are you going ? `` , `` Have you eaten yet ? '' or `` Have you taken your bath yet ? '' . Like Americans , they do n't really care , and the questions are not rude ; it is just a standard greeting.Asking about your health was considered slightly rude , since the state of your internal organs was your business . `` How are you '' is the accepted opening question in the US of A and several other countries . It is just a polite greeting . I used to be offended when people would ask me where I was going , when I was in Malaysia . Then I realized it was just the polite greeting for their culture . If , for instance , someone was going to rob a bank , they would not say so . You have probably seen people on crutches greeted with `` how are you ? '' and heard them reply `` Fine '' .If you visit someone in a hospital and ask how they are doing , you expect a long answer . If you pass them on the street , you do n't ; just a polite ( and empty ) phrase .",0

"whats the best way to fight a cold ? The best way to fight the common cold virusEvery year , as each winter season approaches us , it gets harder and harder for people to avoid getting a cold . It never fails , just as soon as the weather changes a little and starts to turn cold , people begin to sniffle , sneeze and cough and the symptoms of the common cold begin to come around once again.But before you run out to the nearest store to buy a supply of tissues , cold medicine and soup , you need to understand exactly what you are up against . Your chances of being exposed to a cold germ will increase or decrease depending on the amount of contact you have with other people and how you take care of yourself.The cold germ is spread from person to person when someone , who is infected , sneezes or coughs into the air or on you . The airborne germ then enters someone else ’ s body through an orifice , like your eyes , nose or mouth . You can also catch a cold by touching something that a person who has been infected has also touched and then touching your mouth , nose or eyes.There are many things that you can do to prevent yourself from getting a cold.1 . You should wash your hands a lot . This frequent hand washing , especially when using any anti-bacterial soap , will help you to get rid of any potential germs that you might have come into contact with.2 . You should carry and use anti-bacterial hand lotion several times throughout the day . Use it especially when you can not get to a bathroom and you know you have touched something infected or have been near an infected person.3 . You should also get plenty of sleep or rest . If you are tired and fatigued , your body ’ s resistance decreases and you will find that you are more susceptible to colds.There are many ways that you can fight a cold once you have caught one.1 . You should eat spicy foods . Spicy hot foods will cause your body to expel mucus . When you eat these types of foods , your nose will start to run and you will begin to cough up mucus . Spicy foods work just like a natural decongestant but without side effects . This advice is good for those people who can not take over the counter medication.2 . You should drink plenty of liquids . Liquids like soup , water , juice and flat ginger ale will keep your body hydrated . This is true especially if you have a fever . During a fever , your body loses a lot of fluids . You will need to replenish what you have lost . Therefore you need to drink often throughout your illness . You should also avoid drinking any dairy drinks because the dairy will cause mucus to form and coat your throat making it very difficult for you to swallow and cough.3 . You should use a vaporizer . It will keep the air that you breathe moist . If you do not have a vaporizer handy , then just crack open the windows in your home . This is very important if you have an extremely warm and dry home . Cracking the windows will have the same effects that a vaporizer has .",0

"Why is Seriana such a great movie ? Syriana is a political thriller directed by Stephen Gaghan . Gaghan wrote the screenplay , loosely based on the book See No Evil by Robert Baer . George Clooney stars and was one of the film 's executive producers ( along with Steven Soderbergh , Ben Cosgrove , and Jeff Skoll ) .The first scene in the movie is that of Pakistani immigrant workers boarding a bus to Iran to work in a Connex refinery . Later , they find out that they are being laid-off because of the loss of the bid to the Chinese , forcing them into poverty . This is where we meet the father and son ( Wasim Khan ) that will be central to this storyline.The movie 's title is somewhat ambiguous . Some have suggested that it comes from Pax Syriana , as an allusion to the necessary state of peace between Syria and the U.S. as it relates to the oil business . In a December 2005 interview , Baer told NPR that the title is a metaphor for foreign intervention in the Middle East , referring to post-World War I think tank strategic studies for the creation of an artificial state ( such as Iraq , created from the elements of the former Ottoman Empire ) that would ensure continued U.S. access to crude oil .",0

"Heavy water what is the role that heavy water plays in the nuclear explosion process ? Heavy water is like regular water except that instead of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom ( H20 ) it has two deuterium atoms and an oxygen atom ( D20 ) . Deuterium is a hydrogen atom with an extra neutron.Water is used in nuclear reactors to moderate the reaction speed , and to absorb heat . Nuclear fission starts by giving off neutrons that create a chain reaction . Any water around it absorbs those neutrons ( becoming heavy water ) and slows the reaction . If heavy water is used instead of regular hydrogen water , the neutrons are not absorbed . This means that less pure nuclear material can be used to sustain a reaction . For example unrefined uranium , which is much less expensive , can be used instead of enriched uranium .",0

"how to grade elementary papers ? Your question is kind of open-ended . It truly depends on the grade . I work in kindergarten and use just a brightly colored marker to make smiley face on it if it is entirely correct . If there is a mistake , I circle it and write oops ... and ask the child in person to fix it . I NEVER write negative comments in kindergarten so as not to discourage children . If you were looking at an older grade ( 3-6 ) a more definitive grade out of 100 points for example works easier for you and them . The parents and students can begin to gauge an approximate grade for the quarter and you can calculate one much easier . It also gives your final grades a basis to stand on.Whatever you decide , make sure you have the information to back up your final grades for the student.Stamps , stickers and smileys are popular but just make sure it does n't take away from the really great thing about the paper - the student 's accomplishment and hard work !",0

"why should aperson lose their job for forgeetting to turn in money that they are told to keep in their pockets My daughter was a very dedicated employee at Dayton International airport , went to work on her off days just to help out , did whatever her job duties call for her to do , a very repectful young lady that spent six year in the US Army . Nine months in Iraq . She was fired from the airport because they are told to keep money that they collect from customer in their pocket until the end of the day , instead of having a cash box for them to put the money in as soon as they collect it . She forgot she had the money in her pocket three times and took the money home ; therefore they fired her . Although she took the money back each time . She had been working there for one year and that is all they could find to fire her for . She really need her job she have a 4 year old daughter that she is raising . She have bills each month . it 's a shame when young people choose to get out and work and not be on public assistant to get fired for something like that . it 's hard to find jobs . I think it 's sad that your daughter lost her job at the aiport , she sounded like a very dedicated employee willing to go the extra mile even on her days off . But it is probably best she is no longer there because what you are describing here is that she was probably long past exhaustion each time she accidentally took the money home , although I am certain the airport did n't consider this when they decided to fire her.On the WHY part of your question : When she first was employeed by the airport she probably signed an agreement of `` if I mishandle money in any way that is n't in agreement with the airports rules , I understand that is grounds for dismissal '' If she agreed to these terms and broke them , is was their call to be understanding or not . They were 2 times before , but when they see a pattern of it , they are less likely to trust their money is safe . They will protect themsevles before protecting her.I agree they should n't make it so easy to leave your shift without turning the money in first . Just like with waiters and waitresses , or bartenders that most of the time must carry change on them , if the airport had an end shift report to do before each employee was allowed to leave , then it could all be resolved . I do n't know any waiters or waitresses that can leave for the day without giving the company their money first , along with reporting their tipped earnings for the day.Her honesty in giving the money back is something to be proud of , and she should n't hold bad memories against the airport for their descision . She made a mistake , we all do that once in a while . She 'll find another job , and she will have this experience to learn from .",0

"Why is The ocean salty ? [ be specific ] ? All water , even rain water , contains dissolved chemicals which scientists call `` salts . '' But not all water tastes salty . Water is fresh or salty according to individual judgment , and in making this decision man is more convinced by his sense of taste than by a laboratory test . It is one 's taste buds that accept one water and reject another.A simple experiment illustrates this . Fill three glasses with water from the kitchen faucet . Drink from one and it tastes fresh even though some dissolved salts are naturally present . Add a pinch of table salt to the second , and the water may taste fresh or slightly salty depending on a personal taste threshold and on the amount of salt held in a `` pinch . '' But add a teaspoon of salt to the third and your taste buds vehemently protest that this water is too salty to drink ; this glass of water has about the same salt content as a glass of sea water.Obviously , the ocean , in contrast to the water we use daily , contains unacceptable amounts of dissolved chemicals ; it is too salty for human consumption . HOW SALTY IS THE OCEAN ? ... How salty the ocean is , however , defies ordinary comprehension . Some scientists estimate that the oceans contain as much as 50 quadrillion tons ( 50 million billion tons ) of dissolved solids.If the salt in the sea could be removed and spread evenly over the Earth 's land surface it would form a layer more than 500 feet thick , about the height of a 40-story office building . The saltiness of the ocean is more understandable when compared with the salt content of a fresh-water lake . For example , when 1 cubic foot of sea water evaporates it yields about 2.2 pounds of salt , but 1 cubic foot of fresh water from Lake Michigan contains only one one-hundredth ( 0.01 ) of a pound of salt , or about one sixth of an ounce . Thus , sea water is 220 times saltier than the fresh lake water . What arouses the scientist 's curiosity is not so much why the ocean is salty , but why it is n't fresh like the rivers and streams that empty into it . Further , what is the origin of the sea and of its `` salts '' ? And how does one explain ocean water 's remarkably uniform chemical composition ? To these and related questions , scientists seek answers with full awareness that little about the oceans is understood.Illustration : Sources of salts in the ocean.THE ORIGIN OF THE SEA ... In popular language , `` ocean '' and `` sea '' are used interchangeably . Today 's seas are the North and South Pacific , North and South Atlantic , Indian and Arctic Oceans and the Antarctic waters or seas.Scientists believe that the seas are as much as 500 million years old because animals that lived then occur as fossils in rocks which once were under ancient seas . There are several theories about the origin of the seas , but no single theory explains all aspects of this puzzle . Many earth scientists agree with the hypothesis that both the atmosphere and the oceans have accumulated gradually through geologic time from some process of `` degassing '' of the Earth 's interior . According to this theory , the ocean had its origin from the prolonged escape of water vapor and other gases from the molten igneous rocks of the Earth to the clouds surrounding the cooling Earth . After the Earth 's surface had cooled to a temperature below the boiling point of water , rain began to fall and continued to fall for centuries . As the water drained into the great hollows in the Earth 's surface , the primeval ocean came into existence . The forces of gravity prevented the water from leaving the planet.SOURCES OF THE SALTS ... Sea water has been defined as a weak solution of almost everything . Ocean water is indeed a complex solution of mineral salts and of decayed biologic matter that results from the teeming life in the seas . Most of the ocean 's salts were derived from gradual processes such the breaking up of the cooled igneous rocks of the Earth & # 39",0

"Why do people in the US hold such animosity toward overweight people ? It just does n't make sense to me how people can be so cold-hearted to other human beings . I 'm not from the US , but that animosity is reserved for obese ppl the world over ! ! I think it has to do with the misconception that fat ppl got fat cause they have no control over their eating habits and therefore appear to have low self-control , are indisciplined and weak.It 's wrong , of course . But its human nature to feel superior to any perceived notion of lack of discipline or weakness . Which instead of resulting in understanding and tolerance usually comes out as snide and contemptuous.Most fat ppl I know are NOT fat coz they eat like mad monkeys , but it ’ s hormonal or psychological in nature which triggers irregular eating habits among other reasons for obesity .",0

"Anyone seen Puni Puni Poemy ? Anyone ? It 's a purpousely deranged Anime mini series . I love it . What do you all think ? I think PPP was supposed to be an extension ( in style , not in narrative ) of the last episode of Excel Saga - the one that never made it on the air in Japan , from my understanding . Nabeshin ( whose character is based on Watanabe Shinichiro , the director of both series ) is a recurring character . Interesting side note , at the end of ep . 25 of Excel Saga , Nabeshin marries the soup girl ( I forget her name ) - he 's still married to her in PPP , and Poemi is their daughter.Long and short , Watanabe had so much fun doing the `` forbidden '' episode of Excel Saga , that the production company gave him a two-episode OVA to do whatever the heck he pleased . And yeah , he pretty much did.My favorite moment in PPP is the absurd superpowers the sisters have . I can fall backwards without getting hurt !",0
"in connectiom to my last question , Who gave us the knowlegde to be able to attain this said evolution ? Erin pls answer this one ... . all can answer ... . Thats the problem , we dont have to ask who created the creator because we are told that God just `` is , was , and always will be '' . The arrogance of man to think that we are smart enough to understand everything is our greatest downfall . Ever hear people say that when they think they know everything , they learn that they know very little ? Virtually everything that we know today was once unreasonable to the abilities of our brain . Just like no one knew about gravity until it was discovered and able to be measured . People thought the Earth was flat , and when they were told it was round , it took many years before they realized the person was right . Then they discovered later it was somewhat oval . Just because the most intelligent scientist in the world can not understand supernatural things , dont mean they dont exist . Maybe someday someone will discover a way to `` see '' these things too , so that everyone will have the knowledge . Just because it hasnt happened yet dont mean we are at the end of all learning , and it wont.The fact that we are the only animals on the planet that aspire for greatness , desire things that we dont need , and have learned how to create things ourself is proof that God created us in His image . We dont question why we have the ability to learn and evolve , we just take it for granted.Mankind has in effect became gods , because they forgot and no longer appreciate what created them . They believe as long as they can invent and create new things that now they are gods . This has been prophesied in Revelation . Part of being marked with the mark of the beast is man becoming their own god .",0

"A Statistical Evaluation of Multiplicative Congruential Generators ? what the main idea ? This is a cool question . The main idea is to check how random a random number generator really is.A random number generator is a system , usually involving a computer which creates a list of random numbers . All random number generators are really pseudo-random , which just means that unless there is some bizzare input , like static from a radio , the list of numbers is predictable and therefore not really random.For example an example of a simple random number generator is one of a pair of dice . The die will always show a number from 1 to 6 . If you wrote down zillions of rolls of the die , and made a bar chart , a really fair die would show equal length bars for each number . This is an example of an Statistical Evaluation . Other evaluations might be to show what the bar chart curve looks like ( bell curve etc . ) , or the average etc.Fair random number generators are important for gambling machines , state lotteries , scientific testing , and mathematics.The most famous multiplicative linear congruential generator was RANDU invented by IBM in 1968 . By multiplying numbers together one after another using modulo arithmetic ( like the way a clock repeats every 12 hours ) based on a starting number or SEED , it was a simple way to get numbers . Unfortunately , statistical tests showed it was way off . The numbers fell into patterns which were not random .",0

There really is no Black or White answer to this question . Even though , I am sure there are many `` rich '' people in the world who are nice , I 've seen many more who are not so much . In my experience , money has a tendency to change people , even when that person has the best intentions at heart . Although I would love to have more money , I would never wish to be `` rich '' , only comfortable enough to be able to support myself , with no loose ends . I may be going agains the grain , here with my answer , but I think I lean more towards `` poor '' . Those who are poor , or live from paycheck to paycheck , tend to appreciate the small things as we all should . `` Poor '' people do not care about having extravagant houses or 5 cars , one for each day of the week ; they are content with a roof over their family 's head , a meal for each night , and an old dependable clunker to get around in .",0

( Glycosylated hemoglobin [ HbA1c ] should be less than 7 % . ) Renal disease - Proteinuria is a good marker for the development of DR ; thus , patients with diabetic nephropathy should be observed more closely.Systemic hypertension - Increased risk of retinopathy ( DR with superimposed hypertensive retinopathy ) Triglycerides and lipids - Normalization of lipid levels reduces retinal leakage and exudates deposition.Pregnancy - DR can progress rapidly in pregnant women , especially those with preexisting DR . Physical : Funduscopy under stereopsis and high magnification should be performed on every patient with diabetes to assess for DME and DR. An indirect ophthalmoscope does not provide adequate magnification for the ophthalmologist to diagnose DME.DME is defined as retinal thickening within 2 disc diameters of the center of the macula.Focal edema is associated with hard exudate rings resulting from leakage from microaneurysms.Diffuse edema results from breakdown of blood-retinal barrier with leakage from microaneurysms , retinal capillaries , and arterioles.CSME , as defined by the ETDRS , exists with any of the following findings : Retinal thickening within 500 mm of the center of the foveaHard , yellow exudates within 500 mm of the center of the fovea with adjacent retinal thickeningAt least 1 disc area of retinal thickening , any part of which is within 1 disc diameter of the center of the foveaOther physical findings that should be noted include the following : Visual acuity is an important parameter in following the progression of CSME , although it does not aid in the diagnosis of CSME because patients may have a visual acuity of 20/20.The status of the posterior hyaloid ; detached , taut , thickenedCauses : Causes include the following : After 20 years of the disease , nearly all patients with type I diabetes mellitus and 60 % of patients with type II diabetes mellitus will have some degree of retinopathy.Poor control of blood sugar increases the risk of diabetic retinopathy.Renal disease can be a marker for the development of diabetic retinopathy.Systemic hypertension increases the risk of diabetic retinopathy.Elevated lipid levels increase the risk of leakage and exudate deposits .",0

If the density of the atmosphere were a constant 1.2 kg/m3 , calculate where the top of the atmosphere would be . hecka hard ! ! ! any suggestions ? hecka ! ! damn . i miss california.what you have to do is realize that this question is asking about the volume of a rectangular shape that is 1 meter by 1 meter by X meters , where X is the height of the column.so , you know the density.. density is defined as mass divided by volume . and you know the weight.. which is mass times acceleration . here the acceleration is the acceleration of gravity `` g '' = 9.8 m/s^2 . so you can do a little algebra to get the equation volume = mass / density volume = weight / ( acceleration * density ) you know the weight ( 100,000 N ) , the acceleration ( 9.8 m/s^2 ) and the density ( 1.2 kg/m^3 ) . plug those numbers in and you get the VOLUME of the atmosphere , and since you know 2 of the dimensions of the box ( it is 1 square meter across the bottom face , remember ) you can figure out the 3rd pretty easily.since this is your homework i wont just tell you the answer , but you should be pretty much able to crank it out from here .",0

"Which religion preaches most hatred & violence ? please Be honest and speak out even if it is ur own religion. ? All religions resort to hatred and violence . It just happens that Islam is the one doing it now . Christianity used to be the evil one , killing people who did n't `` believe '' for political reasons , invading the `` holy land '' for power grabs . Even today , Christianity still uses hatred for its unifying effect , labelling gays as evil , vile sinners - any religion gets stronger when it devises a common enemy . Religion is simply a way to control people , so violence and hatred go hand in hand with this - if you want to strengthen your hold on people , give them a common enemy - then they 'll do anything you ask .

"Has anyone done a study of the relationship between a woman 's mental health and the number of sex parteners ? The world encourages women these days to be more promiscuous than ever . Is there a price to be paid for this trend ? Has anyone done a study analyzing mental health in reference to the number of sexual partners a woman has ? Um , i strongly disagree with the person above me . But , the thing is , i too have not heard of a specific study done to analyze the mental health of women in relation to the number of sexual partners she has had . However , what i do know from speakers in various organizations , tell me that there is a real link to guilt and depression with the number of sex partners she has had in her life . Guilt when her husband knows that she has given away the gift reserved for husbands . ALthough her husband might not feel it 's a big deal , and has told her that , she still feels insecure . Depression may not be a direct cause of the number of sex partners , but it sure is related . Because when women have more sex partners , she increases her risk of becoming pregnant and contracting an STD with each partner she has . So , in the likelihood that she has become pregnant , she would most probably go for an abortion . And after the first abortion , she would be more likely to have more than one abortion . Increased abortions and HPV lead to cervical cancer and no children . And that leads to depression . It 's a sad state of affairs , but that is why more women are finding it hard to conceive and gets depressed because of it .",0

"Do you think kissing is cheating ? Even if she kissed hollywood star ? Well was she kissing them with the intent of getting into bed or just a peck on the cheek . Some people are comfortable greeting others with a kiss , and a hug . while others are only comfortable with a polite handshake.Each couple has to establish boundries . It reminds me of an event about 4 years ago when a married couple went to a Lions Football game . they stayed at the same hotel as the visiting team . while down in the lounge one of the ( PRO ) athelets was trying to pick up the wife right in front of the hubby . the wife was all game for sex with a star and hubby was not happy . Her answer was this is a once in a life time event . if you ruin it for me I 'll make you regret it for the rest of your life . and he responded by saying `` if I let you then I 'll still regret be the one regretting it for the rest of my life and so will you '' He then asked her what 's more important to her sleeping with a star or being married to me ? Her responce was to turn and leave with the pro and , off they went . Hubby in a fit of anger went back to the room packed all his clothers and hers and checked out . and drove home . On the way he contacted his atty . and filed for divorce . as well as canceled all the credit cards , and placed a stolen report on the checking account . Wifey several hours later after her little adventure with the ( pro ) was trying to get back into the room . and could not figure out why the card did not work . She contacted the front desk only to learn the hubby had left . She went crying back to the ( pro ) , and he laughed and asked her what did she expect no `` man '' worth his salt would want any thing to do with a `` slut '' once he is done with her . well after getting pissed , and the hollering and screaming between the lovers . the ( pro ) had her tossed out of the hotel for stalking . Now crying , and feeling miserable she tried repeatedly to call her hubby , and only got the Answering machine . she tried to use the credit cards and learned they did not work . Now thourly pissed in her own right she calls hubby back and rips him up one side and down the other and called him every name in the book , but eventually she found a ride home . only to learn all the locks on the house had been changes . He left a note on the door for her along with some cash telling her to go back to her hotel maybe she could sleep her way into another man 's life . Needless to say they ended up divorced , and she was left holding the bag as he got custody , and did not have to pay Alimony . So basically each person has to weigh the options in the relationship .

"To Christians- Who created God ? If God created man , animals , and everything else , then who created God ? I believe that is the same type of question as where did the matter in the big bang theory come from ? In accordance with the physical laws of this universe , it is impossible for the matter in the big bang theory to have come out of nothing or to have just always existed . It is impossible for something to come out of nothing ... I 'm sure you agree with this . Also , the universe is expanding , which indicates that it had a beginning point in time . So you 're question appears to be , `` If it is impossible for the earth to have always been in existance , how is it logical to believe that God has always been in existance ? `` The thing is , we know that the earth had a beginning and that it is impossible for it to have just come about on its own by the physical laws of this world . But if God created everything ( which I believe He did ) , then He is not bound by the laws He created . He made up the laws of physics . How could He be limited to those laws ? We can not think of God in terms of our physical world . God made up the rules , therefore God is not under the rules . He is eternal . The world which He created is not . Here 's another thought I 'm just going to throw out here , even though it does not go right along with your original question . If you believe that you have a soul or a spirit , or if you believe in any type of spirit beings , how could these have come about by purely by physical means ? Can spiritual things come from physical things ? If this world only came about by matter and not by God , how could matter produce spiritual things ? `` For by Him [ Jesus ] all things were created : things in heaven and on earth , visible and invisble , whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities ; all things were created by Him and for Him . He is before all things , and in Him all things hold together . '' Colossians 1:16-17 ( [ Jesus ] was added by me for clarification of the pronoun Him . )",0

When we become greedy we lose out because our whole life is spent grabbing wealth so we can get ahead . Ahead for what ? New house , more cars , more hedonistic pleasures to fulfill the emptiness we really feel inside . The Bible says , `` money is the root of all evil .

"What is a slider ? What is the tragectory of a slider , and how is it different from a curveball ? How is a slider typically thrown ? In baseball , a slider ( also known as a `` nickel curve '' ) is a pitch halfway between a curveball and a fastball , with less break but more speed than the curve . It will tend to drop less and move toward or away from the batter more than a curve . The extra speed can fool the hitter into thinking it is a fastball , until too late . Some pitchers also use a cut fastball ( or cutter ) which is one step closer than the slider to the fastball on the spectrum between fastballs and curves . A pitch that has movement similar to both a slider and a curveball is sometimes called a slurve.In addition , the term 'slider ' often refers to mini hamburgers , such as those at White Castle or often served at pubs .",0

"What kind of lies did the Ku Klux Klan tell ? An why did people go along with it for so long ? There are so many articles about the Klu Klux Klan that it boggles the mind . In a nutshell they - like Nazi Germany - beleived that the white race was omnipotent and that all other races are/were subservient or corrupt in some manner . Therefore they agreed that by process of elimination , they would rule as the all powerful white race . This misguided belief was fueled in part by the rife prejudices in the southern parts of the US . Since they beleived that blacks and other races were not in their white power plan , and these races were no better than dogs and should be treated as such , they proceeded with a process called culling . This is where they mistakenly thought that they could rule society and that everyone would go along with their beliefs . They used the bible and twisted its teachings to enforce their beliefs . A lot of people went along with it , in part , because of the slavery and its abolition in later years , but also because it was the `` Christian '' thing to do . Some thought that if they were true christians they had to go along with it , because they beleived the words of the Grand wizard . The Klu Klux Klan was a secret society for a long time . Mostly joined by angry white southern gentlemen who didnt like the abolition of slavery . I use the term gentlemen loosely . If you google the name it will come up and you can read all about it..",0

( you know what that one thing is ) I want to know why ... and how to tell them im not ever going to give them any ! At least they are nice to you . : DDo n't tell them you are a lesbian . Being up front and honest with someone about how you choose to live your life is the best way to deal with relationships , from the start . Some people may tell you that will only challenge the guy . That 's no lie . But , it will be the right kind of challenge when you live by your values . Some guys will tell you , `` Well I HAVE to try or you would think I was gay . '' That 's why they do it . It 's natural instinct . The urban legend is that men think about sex every seven seconds . snopes.com says that is not a fact , however I believe there must be something to this if so many people think it.How to tell a guy you are not ever going to give them any ? There 's another saying to never say never , cause you might jinx yourself and end up doing what you say you are never going to do , but if you insist ... '' I am not ever going to give it to you .

"what happens if an inmate doesnt die on the first try of the execution stage of a death sentance ? Execution is complete upon the death of the inmate .

The rationale being that he had served his sentence.. executed and pronounced dead.He could n't therefore be sentenced again for no man could be punished twice for the same offence and I believe its what we call 'double jeopardy'.Therefore , if you die and live after being executed ... you are a free man ... but is there such a chance ? : )",0

It could be a different nerve exclusively or a different nerve plus the sciatic nerve .

"Getting started as a Financial Analyst ? I have a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and have over 5 years of experience in the field . Unfortunately I 've decided that it 's not my cup of tea and I have recently looked into switching careers.I 've always been an analytical and thorough person so I feel a career as a financial analyst in a corporate setting ( as opposed to an investment bank ) would suit me well . I 've already taken about 6 accounting classes and have gotten A 's in all of my classes . The only problem is , I do n't know where to get started . What 's the best way into the position ? My options at the moment are : * Get an Associates Degree in Accounting* Get a second Bachelors Degree in Accounting/Finance* Get a Masters Degree in Accounting* Take the CPA exam w/o the required work experienceOut of all of these options , what 's the best choice in getting hired ? I believe your best option is to obtain your bachelors degree in accounting/finance . Inherently , this is a more attractive degree due to the amount of education obtained . Furthermore , any respectable company will require a bachelors degree for a financial analyst position.While the other two options are not bad , they will not help you greatly so I would do them only if it is in addition to the second bachelors degree . Passing the CPA exam without the work experience will not obtain you your certification , which is the true `` resume value '' so you would have only passed a test and would have an interest dinner conversation piece at best.The masters degree in accounting is also nice as a supplement to your bachelors degree , but entirely unnecessary . Most firms/corporations you talk with are not interested in a graduate degree unless it is specifically applicable to the position , which for a financial analyst position it is not . Those are just my thoughts.. : - )",0

"how do you remove a charge off from a credit report ? If you have a charge off , you have to pay the debt . That 's the only way to get rid of it . You can wait 7 yrs til it falls off your credit report , but you still owe the money , collectors will continue to call you . A charge-off is a term used to explain a debt that is over 180 days past due . If you wait for it to fall of your credit report , you also run the risk of them filing a judgement against you ( which is on your credit report for 10 years ! ) , or suing you for the money before the 7 years . LOL at all the people who think that your debt disappears after 7 years . That 's just the limit as to how long it can hurt your credit . You will always owe the money.The other people who have responded have responded in a way as if the debt was n't a valid debt . If this debt is rightfully yours , a letter of dispute or any of the suggested things are useless .",0

"how long is ovalating and how do you know if your ovalation ? Ovulation always occurs during the middle of your cycle . Key things you can look for is a clear , slippery , elastic discharge that signals you are ovulating . If you have a basal thermometer you will also see a rise in your temperature . A good way to track when you are ovulating and whether you are fertile or not is to chart your cervical mucus and temperature . Another thing you can do is use an ovulation microscope which will show when you are ovulating . The best thing to do is to use software in which you can not only chart down your temp and mucus , but also other data including when you have had sexual relations . This software will calculate when your fertile and non-fertile days are , and is a good way to keep track of your periods . I always reccomend femta which is at www.femta.com and ovusoft which is at www.ovusoft.com",0

"while visiting Appomattox I noticed that the grave markers were covered with coins . What is the reason for thi There are many theories why people place coins and other `` offerings '' on headstones . I have seen this at many historic sites , Calvin Coolidge grave etc.1 . Some say money left at graveside goes back to the coins left at graves in ancient Greece to pay Charon , for ferry passage over the River Styx to Hades.2 . It is a widespread custom to leave a small remembrance as a sign of respect in many cultures.3 . It may be a secular version of the Jewish tradition of putting a pebble on the gravestone to show remembrance and respect.In `` The Jewish Home : a guide for Jewish living : by Daniel B. Syme it says the following : > > '' In biblical times , ... graves were sometimes marked by a pile of stones . Some scholars suggest that this may explain the custom of leaving pebbles . There is no religious basis for the practice . It serves to indicate that loved ones have been to the grave , and that alone is sufficient cause to justify it . At least one contemporary rabbi , however , has suggested that leaving a stone may also have therapeutic benefit for us , especially if we see it as a symbolic means of leaving behind some of the 'hardness ' of grief and pain .

"Is an IRA account protected against civil judgement from a lawsuit when the account owner lives in NYC or NJ ? I am not sure how the state laws of NY or NJ address the protection of IRA assets , but the new bankruptcy law enacted last year does provide ceratin protections on a national basis . the following excerpt is from `` http : //www.retirement-retirement.com/story-486.php '' [ Especially important to participants in employer-based retirement plans is that the bankruptcy act says that all assets rolled over from these plans into an IRA , and all subsequent earnings made inside the account attributable to the rollover , are protected from creditors , regardless of the amount of the rollover . That should remove much of the reluctance among investors to move most retirement plan assets into IRAs if they decide that 's the best financial strategy . While IRAs have unlimited protection for certain rollover amounts , such is not the case for original ( non-rollover ) contributions by the owner to traditional and Roth IRAs . The bankruptcy act put a price tag on the `` reasonably necessary '' amount that might be protected in these IRAs ­ $ 1 million . That is , if the aggregated value of your original contributions and their earnings to traditional and Roth IRAs exceeds $ 1 million , the amount above $ 1 million ( excluding any protected rollover amounts ) could be vulnerable to creditors . That $ 1 million amount is indexed annually to inflation . Most investors building an IRA from scratch wo n't exceed the $ 1 million limit , since annual contribution limits to traditional and Roth IRAs have been relatively low for the past two decades . And the bankruptcy act allows bankruptcy courts to permit the IRA owner to keep more than $ 1 million if it is in the `` interest of justice '' ( though the act did not spell out what constitutes an interest in justice ) . ]",0

"Why does science and religion conflict with each other so much ? Old Goat is correct . It would help to know specifics . But consider just ONE example . The book of Job is the oldest book in the Bible . It even predates Moses . So , in that period of time , how did other cultures view the earth ? Flat , supported by Atlas or giant elephants ... But look what it reads in the book of Job ... `` God hangs the earth on nothing . '' And in Isaiah it reads , `` It is God who sits above the circle of the earth . '' That word `` circle '' in Hebrew is ball or sphere . So if people poopoo the Bible with their lofty scientific thinking , they have probably not even read the Bible to check . I know scientists who have read the Bible , and are amazed at how accurate it is.We know that all matter is made up of atoms and electrons . I nor any scientist has ever seen an electron . But because of scientific study , we know they exist . The Bible reads in Hebrews 11:3 ... '' Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear . `` So the only conflict comes when secular scientist blow off the Bible without cause .

"How do you help a people who lost 6 million souls ? My great grandfather was captured brought to Auswitz Natzi death camp and tortured for a long time untill one day he escaped succesfull but while losing his friends who were shot and killed by the Nazis in an attempt to escape . Out of 26 only 4 lived . 6 Million of my anscestors perrsihed in what is called the Holocost . Oh ! `` Tears '' This is so hard to write ! Can you imagine being 10 years old in one of those cattle cars not knowing where these nazis were taking you and then seeing the smoke from the creamatroiums . You ask , where is my father or mother and someone points to the smoke and sais , there , they are going to heaven . `` Weeps ! `` .We must never forget the holocost folks ! But I wonder if any of you have an idea of how this Jew from a surviving family of the holocost could honar and help other such families ? I just do n't know how to express my heart and its breaking when i considder 6 million of my own people dead at the hand of Hitler . Paperclips is a very powerful documentary and I agree , EVERYONE should watch it . It should be a requirement in school . As should be Schindlers List . All through my childhood I heard my fraternal grandparents talk about Hitler and the Nazis . They came to the state not long after he came into power and started persecuting the jews . While not jewish themselves they had many close friends that were and could n't stand to watch them suffer . Knowing this was only the beginning they left Germany and came to the US . If Hitlers name was mentioned around my Grandma tears welled up in her eyes and she called hi the worst evil that had ever happened to mankind . But by far the most powerful and moving thing I have ever felt was when I was 16 . I was visiting relatives in Europe with my Aunt . Knowing what I was studying in school that semester we took a side trip and she took me to Auschwitz so that i could truely understand what I was being taught , though we were n't Jewish she wanted me to understand . As long as I live i will remember that , seeing the ovens and hearing what happened there . It was almost as if that place screamed in pain still for the evil that was committed there . No member of our tour group was left dry eyed by the time it was over . The most vivid memory of it was seeing the ovens then hearing the older lady next to us break down in tears . Turns out she was dying of cancer and before she departed this earth she had to see where he parents and brothers had perished.To so many of us evil of this enormity is hard to grasp and fathom but every day of our lives we see or hear a small part of it . Every time you utter a racial slur , make a biggoted remark , show intolerance to anothers religion or belief system you are perpetuating Hitlers legacy . Because that is what it was , hatered and biggotry and intolerance . It took 6 million people dying for the rest of the world to understand that lesson , of what that mindframe and and those views can bring about . And the worst thing we can do is forget it or glorify the kinds of acts or thinking that brought on all of those deaths . Because it was n't hitler alone that killed them all , it was people who felt the way he did and thought nothing of it . Look around you and i bet you have met people like that . Or maybe you are yourself , so none of this has gone away and all the lessons have not sunk in . Six million people , our minds truely ca n't wrap around that number . All because of intolerance and biggotry . As you read through the answers to some of the questions on these pages you can see it here as well . Intolerance to other peoples view or religions , a supreme and superior attitude because 'I am right my religion is right the rest of you are wrong ' . That attitude is what helped take 6 million people from this earth . That is what ALLOWED the nazis to do what they did . They saw those in those camps as wrong and not as good as themselves , that they were superior . Those camps still exhist today as a reminder of that evil . And believe me if you walk through the gates you can feel it , you can feel the pain and anguish that went on there . It screams at you from every inch of it . 6 MILLION people killed because someone else was sure they were right and they were superior . Those shows on the History Channel SHOULD upset you ! They should upset you every time you see them and never should you become callous to them or what they show . That is about the only reminder this world has left of what can come from biggotry and hatered.Next time , before you write out from your superior point of view and point out how everyone else is wrong , or laugh at an ethnic joke or make fun of someone because they are different think about Hitler and what that kind of mindset can cause ... SIX MILLION SOULS TAKEN FROM THIS EARTH BECAUSE THE NAZIS THOUGHT THEY WERE BETTER AND KNEW THEY WERE RIGHT !",0

To verify that , close your internet connection and leave your computer open . If the problem persists despite having closed your internet connection then it could mean a hardware problem . Use one of the freeware internet programs to monitor your computer 's temperature . If all appears normal there , it might be another virus ( check for abnormal processes or cpu usage at your process manager ) or a recently installed DDR chip that does not quite agree with your computer or a software installation that did not complete quite succesfully . If none of the above is the case I should advise going to the hardware store from which you bought the computer and ask some professional advice",0

"why women are instant floaters than men ? Women usually float better than because the usually have more `` fat '' in the right areas . The most buoyant part of a person is the upper body because of the air in the lungs . Women ( due to physical makeup ) have most of there fat deposits in the butt and the leg area , and since fat is more buoyant than muscles it helps the legs float and appear more buoyant . Men have there fat deposited in their stomach region . Their legs tend to drop and not appear as buoyant as women .",0
"What would a goatherd or shepherd wear in the Middle Ages ? well , since those folks would 've been considered `` peasants '' this might help you out - `` Peasant ClothingPeasant men wore stockings or tunics , while women wore long gowns with sleeveless tunics and wimples to cover their hair . Sheepskin cloaks and woolen hats and mittens were worn in winter for protection from the cold and rain . Leather boots were covered with wooden patens to keep the feet dry . The outer clothes were almost never laundered , but the linen underwear was regularly washed . The smell of wood smoke that permeated the clothing seemed to act as a deodorant . Peasant women spun wool into the threads that were woven into the cloth for these garments . ''",0

"Is there any effective home remedy for skin tags ? A dermatologist will freeze it then if necessary cauterize ( burn ) it.You can do this at home by buying a wart removing medicine that freezes the skin . After following the directions on the package for about 1-2 weeks you will notice that the `` tag '' will fall off then your skin heals over time . You can also burn it off by going to the same wart removing isle in the pharmacy and buying Salicylic acid . This is the stuff that is used in acne medicine but acne medicine has very little percent per volume . Buy the real stuff , it 's available over the counter in the wart removing section and dab a little bit on each skin tag . Follow the directions as noted in the package and you will notice that the skin tags will fall off and the skin will heal after a while .",0

"Does debris affect a tornadoes wind speed ? The funnel of a tornado is actually clear . The only way we actually see the tornado is because of the debris that is circulating inside the funnel . The wind speed of the tornado will not increase because of debris . Debris can only be a hinderance to a tornado . To help you think about this , think about a very large piece of debris , lets say a mountain . Now while the mountain is not going to be picked up and tossed around like dirt , cows , trucks and some houses , it is still something that is getting in the way of a tornado . The mid-west experiences far more tornadoes than any other region . This is because they are uninhibited from forming . Basically the more you put in the way of the funnel the more difficult it will be for that funnel ( aka the tornado ) to form . To put it on a level that everyone can relate to , think of your toilet . When you flush the toilet the water starts to swirl . A funnel begins to appear in the water and eventually everything goes away . What happens if there is too much TP ( debris ) in the way ? The funnel never forms and you get a clog . I hope this helps .",0

"Where can I learn all about the basics of credit cards ? i know almost nothing about them except that you use them to pay for things . i want to know first the basics , and then strategies to avoid having bad credit ( i dont have any credit yet ) . I 've been searching all over , but the websites i find are always using terms and acronyms that i 'm not sure i know the meaning of . can someone help me out ? I agree with VaTreasures - the best thing you can do when using a credit card is to discipline yourself to pay off your balance on time . If you get into a habit of not paying on time you start to acrue more and more interest fees ( I know all about it ) . Paying back on time will also avoid any missed payment penalties.Apply for a credit card with an interest free period , this will cut down on costs . Getting an interest free period is important.If you are unhappy with the idea of running a credit account , then I would recommend a prepaid card or direct debit card . Prepaid cards can be loaded with funds so you can not overspend , which keeps your finances in good shape . Debit cards withdraw funds from your bank account instantly when you make a purchase , again these do not require managing a credit account and help discipline your spending.More helpful tips from round the web :",0

"What are the best studio monitor speakers for under $ 500 ? I assume here that you are asking about nearfield active monitors , and that you are aiming for sub- $ 500 for the pair ( not each ) . There are a few factors which play into the decision , including ( a ) the type of music you will be working with , ( b ) your workstation setup , and ( c ) the room.The type of music can determine whether or not you need a subwoofer . If you do , that 's an additional component which you will need to factor into your overall budget.The workstation setup will play into the positioning and power of the speakers . How much space do you have ? Where will the speakers go , and will they be near any walls or corners ? How will they be positioned relative to your head ? ( assuming nearfield ) The room can play a bit into the monitor decision , but it 's probably a bit more of a factor in tuning your setup once you have your monitors . Look into room acoustics as you 're making your monitor decision to understand what your overall monitoring/room setup will entail.Having thought a bit about the above , the key thing for monitors is to have something sufficiently detailed and revealing to make accurate mixes . Ideally , it wo n't be too fatiguing , as you will most likely be listening to them for extended periods of time . On top of that , it 's mostly a matter of getting accustomed to them so you can make accurate mixing decisions . The net of all of this is that monitor choices are fairly personal . Keep in mind that the goal is to get something accurate which will allow you to hear everything you need to hear , which is NOT the same as `` sounding good '' . Take some CDs and audition your top candidates against music you know well , focusing on key portions that highlight particular ranges or potential problem areas ( extended low bass , detailed highs , stereo imaging , etc . ) It can help to take some of your own mixes , if possible.Some specific inexpensive monitors I 've heard good things about are the KRK Rokits and the lower-end Events . Again , the key is to be familiar with the speakers so you can make accurate mixes .",0

"what is a good homemade remedy for constipation ? Folks , do you know how NASTY prune juice is ? *shudder*Prunes do work ( and prune juice , if you 're a taste bud masochist ) ; however , they work by a chemical laxative - it 's a natural chemical , but you do n't want to take any chemical inducement on a regular basis , even if it comes from a tree and not from a test tube.If this is a one time thing , it does n't matter really whether you take ex-lax or prunes , they will both work.However , if you have constipation fairly often , it 's going to be more of a management thing than a quick fix sort of thing . At that means adding fiber to your diet . Still , you do n't need to take metamucil every night . First , eat the most whole grain bread you like . For some people , switching from white to whole grain bread may be all you need.Here are some other good sources : Fruits and veggies - the crunchier the better . Apples are especially good , as are whole oranges . ( And cooking does n't destroy fiber , so it only needs to be crunchy in its raw state.Oatmeal , brown rice , and other whole grain cereals and grains . And anything made with these.Citrus marmalades ! Citrus skin is an excellent source of both vitamin C and fiber.Dried fruit . Raisins are good , without the er , immediacy that prunes can incur.So , metamucil , apple , or oatmeal raisin cookie with diced orange peel .",0

AND YET THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO REFUSE TO GIVE GOD THE PRAISE HE DESERVES , CAN ANYONE SHARE AS TO WHY THEY BELIEVE AND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO GIVE ANY TESTIMONIES YOU MAY HAVE . I AM PRESENTING A SPEECH IN MY PUBLIC SPEAKING CLASS ON HOW IMPORTANT BELIEVING GOD IS AND I WOULD LOVE TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS FROM REAL EVERYDAY PEOPLE THAT LOVE CHRIST JUST AS I DO . THANK YOU . I became a Christian when I was 14 . My grandma was living with us and had Alzheimer 's disease . There was a lot of fighting in my family . I was watching TBN and Jan Crouch invited me to give my life to Christ . She said that God wants to take me from where I am and do something amazing with my life . I just have to trust Him . So right then and there I bowed my head and asked Christ into my heart.Since then , God has done amazing things in my life . Today , I 'm a college graduate and will be pursuing a Master 's degree in Special Education . I was on my college newspaper and won a first place award in the entire state for my Opinion writing . I give all the glory to God for my accomplishments.God even rescued me from a cult . I joined a cult when I was in college , and my spirit began to cry out for God . Late at night , I went to the Christian church where I 'd been baptized originally . The ( huge ) church was completely empty as far as I could tell , but I saw a light under one door . I put my hand on the door handle , opened the door , went in and prayed with the pastor in there . After that I became active in the church again and seeing me later the pastor told me that the door I 'd walked through was acutally locked -- he checked after I left , but I 'd opened it like it was open . I know a miracle happened there and God opened the door for me.On an intellectual level , I 've come to understand that God is more real than we have ever imagined . I 've read books such as `` More than a Carpenter '' by Josh McDowell , `` The Case for Faith '' by Lee Strobel and the information on the website of the Institute for Creation Research at http : //www.icr.org As I 've gotten older I 've come to believe in God on an intellectual level as well as in my heart .",0

"what does high IgG and IgM values mean in immunoglobolin blood tests ? It could be an indicator of an auto-immune problem , or it could be nothing . The test itself having high levels really does n't tell anything by itself . You really need to discuss with your doctor if you have other symptoms , what they are , how severe they are , how frequent , what brings them on , and you would really benefit from keeping a journal of all that information , because sometimes there is so much you forget . Write down anything , sometimes things you think are no big deal can be relevant.If you had other tests taken , you should discuss those results as well . I have SLE ( lupus ) and I know from personal experience that it takes a lot of positive factors and time to determine a person even has an auto-immune problem . You are your own best advocate , so speak up for yourself . In the meantime , check out these websites , they may be able to help with information specific to the condition you are being checked for , support for you and your family , and possibly links to other sites that specialize in your particular problem . Good luck !",0

"why are you a Christian ? honestly I was introduced to Christianity growing up , but that is n't why I 'm Christian . It is very obvious to me that someone had to create the world and universe . So many wonderful miraculous things happen to people that can not be explained by logic , or natural order . Even the complexity of natural order is too vast to be by impossible chance . This led me to know that there is a Supreme Being.As for why Christianity , there are a couple of reasons . The Bible has never been proven inacurate , which supports the fact that it is divinely inspired . Some good/interesting books about this topic are written by Lee Strobel `` The Case for Christ '' `` The Case for a Creator '' and a couple more . Even when the Bible has n't been believed , someone has come across ruins that disproves man 's theory , and inforces that the Bible is right . Creation interpretation of data makes sense to me , and having the world be ~6000 years old gets rid of lots of problems ( like there should be billions more people on the earth if it has been around for millions of years , the fact that trees that are buried in layers supposedly thousands of years apart should have rotted , not nearly enough fossils- let alone NONE that are inbetweens , etc ) . These are physical external reasons to me.There is also a much more important internal aspect to why I allow Christ to rule my life . Reading His Word , applying His principles ( which never contradict each other ) , and knowing that someone always loves me no matter how much I screw up has made a difference in my life . This change is so real that I can be certain of God , His Son , and the Holy Spirit . I now never have that 'does anybody care ? ' empty feeling , or the 'why am I even here/what is the point of existance ? ' attitude . This does not mean that I have the perfect life , and all is sunshine . I sometimes have down days , I still get frusterated at times and ask why , but there is always an instruction manual to go to , and He is always with me . That is a very comforting thought , that the God of the entire universe specifically loves me , cares about me , listens to me whenever I take the time to talk with Him , and can change my attitudes and bless me . How wonderful !",0
"Have you ever had a professional massage ? If yes , what were your expectations going in , and how did it work out ? If no , why not ? Yes . The expectation would vary depending on where you were getting the massage . If you are at a legitmate clinic with licensed therapists - in medical atmosphere , you would n't have the same expectations as you would if you are at Palm Tree Asian Spa - where the therapists are attractive Asian women dressed seductively ( or slutty ) . Try both and compare . Just because you go into an Asian Spa , that does not mean you have to participate in some of the extra activity that goes on . Just going in for the regular services can be very interesting..not to mention relaxing .",0
"What is the preferred treatment for a large hematoma on the shin caused by trauma ? The area on the shin is large ( 3 inches by 2 inches ) and very swollen and has n't changed for 3 months . Doctor says it may take 6 months to `` go down '' and that , if not , it may need to be `` drained '' . The doctors are right . I developed one on my shin after a wreck . 6 months later it was flat and only minorly discolored , 8 months later it was no longer painful to the touch and the coloration had gone , 10 months later it no longer hurt to run . It does take a while , I would wait as long as you can to decide to get it drained , because I was told this can be painful . But if there 's absolutely no change in color or size after 7 months , you may want to go for it , cause that 's about when the calcification process starts ( Eventually it will turn hard . ) Healing time also depends on where the hematoma is located . If there is mostly bone and not alot of muscle mass , it may not take as long ( i.e . top of foot , hand , etc . ) In areas with much muscle mass and fat , it may take a long time , because the muscle absorbs all the protein.Here 's what you can do to hurry it a little : Fill a styrofoam cup with water and freeze.Tear the top rim off so a half inch or so protrudes like chapstick.Massage the hematoma lightly with this ice for 15 minutes at a time , 3 to 4 times daily.At night , use some form of localized heat , that can be comfortable and not dangerous or painfull . This will help promote bloodflow in that area.DO N'T rub or massage the area , you may make the area bleed again under the skin , starting you back at day 1.Eat a diet rich in protein.Get extra rest if the hematoma is on your legs or feet.Good luck , I hope this helps you .",0

"What does a scaled score of 363 mean on the MAT ? The MAT scaled scores currently range from 200 to 600 with a mean ( average ) of 400 . So a score of 363 is somewhat below the average score . In order to know just how much below average this score represents you need to know the standard deviation of the test to see if it 363 is greater than one standard deviation below the norm . Otherwise it would fall within the normal range.Your personal score report should also have given you a percentile rank , which tells you how you did in comparison with others who took the test . This is sometimes easier to understand than standard scores . For example , a percentile rank of 45 means that you scored as high or higher than 45 out of 100 people who took the test .",0
"what happen to a chicken egg in water vs a chicken egg in vinegar and why ? Several things can happen .

This could be to make them produce industrial enzymes , designer agriculture , or biopharmaceuticals . the genetic code is pretty much universal , meaning we can take a gene from one organiand put into another to acheive specific results . Industrial enzymes can be used for anything from cleaning wastewater with special enzymes to degrade certain toxins , to making enzymes that breakdown starch into sugar for the production of ethanol for fuel , to the making of specific detergents . With agriculture , we can transfect plants with genes that make them more resistant to diseases or vermin , or more robust and able to grow under more varied claimates , or we can make food bigger or more nutritious . In biopharmceuticals , we address genetic disorders by creating the proteins that some people are unable to make for themselves , allowing them to lead more normal lives .",0

"You Think USA will attack to iran or not ? US will not dare attacking Iran . Iran is n't like Iraq and is the biggest military power in the middle east . Iran is one of the biggest suppliers of oil in the world , if this attack happens the prices of oil will rise to big amounts like 90 dollars , and maybe even more . US knows that it has several military bases in the range of Iranian missles and in the case of this war Iran can easily hit American bases specially in Iraq . United States knows that in the case of this attack Iran is n't the loser , because the people of Iran have always supported their country in the case of a war . Iran has some close allies in Iraq , Syria , and Lebanon each one of these allies can cause big damages to the American troops.Airforce is not an option . United States ca n't attack Iran with airforce because of the new anti aircraft and missle systems Iran has bought from Russia .

"Who discovered the planet Pluto and how did it get its name ? Pluto was discovered by the astronomer Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona on February 18 , 1930 . In the matter of Pluto the discretion of naming the new object belonged to Lowell Observatory and its director , Vesto Melvin Slipher , who , in the words of Tombaugh , was `` urged to suggest a name for the new planet before someone else did '' . The name retained for the planet is that of the Roman god Pluto , and it is also intended to evoke the initials of the astronomer Percival Lowell , who predicted that a planet would be found beyond Neptune . The name was first suggested by Venetia Burney , at the time an eleven-year-old girl from Oxford , England . Over the breakfast table , one morning her grandfather , who worked at Oxford University 's Bodleian Library , was reading about the discovery of the new planet in the Times newspaper . He asked his granddaughter what she thought would be good name for it . Venetia thought that as it was so cold and so distant it should be named after the Roman God of the underworld . Professor Herbert Hall Turner cabled his colleagues in America with this suggestion , and after favourable consideration which was almost unanimous , the name Pluto was officially adopted and an announcement made by Slipher on May 1 , 1930 .",0

"Are there 2 Full moons this month ( december ) ? I read a blog that someone posted that siad that there was a blue moon this month , meaning that there were 2 full moons . The blog siad that 12/31/05 was a blue moon . Is this true ? All I can find is that 12/31 will be our second NEW moon , not blue moon . Nope it has to be 2 full moons . Not 2 new moons . There 's only been one full moon this month . there will be , however , two new moons . one was on the 1st and the other will be the 31st ... . the full moon happened on December 15th.A `` Blue Moon '' is the name given to the second full moon in a calendar month . Because there are roughly 29.5 days between full moons , it is unusual for two full moons to `` fit '' into a 30 or 31 day month ( and impossible to fit into a 28 or 29 day month , so February can never have a Blue Moon ) . The saying `` Once in a Blue Moon '' means a rare occurrence , and predates the current astronomical use of the term , which is quite recent . In fact , Blue Moons are not all that rare , on average there will be one Blue Moon every 2.5 years . After 1999 , the next Blue Moons will be in November 2001 ; July 2004 ; and June 2007 . The last one before 1999 was in July 1996 . The term Blue Moon is believed to have originated in 1883 after the eruption of Krakatoa . The volcano put so much dust in the atmosphere that the Moon actually looked blue in color . This was so unusual that the term `` once in a Blue Moon '' was coined . However , Blue Moon was also used in much the same way we use the term `` Harvest Moon '' . There were twelve names for full moons , one for each month , and the name Blue Moon was used in years which had 13 full moons . It referred to the third full moon of the four occuring between an equinox and solstice in that year . A misinterpretation of this led to a Sky and Telescope Magazine `` Star Quiz '' in July 1943 followed by an article in March 1946 which stated that the second full moon in any calendar month was called a Blue Moon ( attributed to the 1937 Maine Farmers ' Almanac ) , and this definition has now become part of the language . In January and March of 1999 , we had a situation which only takes place about four times a century : two Blue Moons occurring in the same year . The last time this happened was in January and April of 1961 and it will not happen again until January and March of 2018 . A double Blue Moon most commonly occurs in January/March but is also possible in January/April or January/May and only when there is no full moon at all in February . It is also possible to have a Blue Moon in December of one year and March of the next year , again , there is no full moon in the intervening February . That might have been way more info than you wanted , but now you know ... and knowing is half the battle .",0

"why are women so mentally differant from men ? why is it that when a man knows that somthing is bothering a woman and he ask her `` whats wrong '' they always say `` nothing '' ... but if the roles are reversed he tells her whats bothering him . The right and left hemispheres of the human brain are connected by a huge nerve bundle called the corpus callosum . In the male fetus when male hormones are generated the corpus callosum shrinks reducing cross-communication . Because the left hemisphere deals with logic and the right hemisphere deals with emotion , women connect all logic better with emotion than men do . Although a man can chose , he is always either logical or emotional but rarely both at the same time . A man either flies off the handle or thinks the problem through . A woman can weep or laugh when she discovers something that makes sense . This explains why women are better at nurturing ( cranky ) children and men are better at hunting for bears ( or a six pack ) . You figure out the rest . I ca n't .",0

"what is Magic Flax ? Flax Is an Ancient CropFlax has been grown since the beginnings of civilization , and people all over the world have celebrated its usefulness throughout the ages . Cultivated flax , L. usitatissimum , is of two types : one is grown for the seed and the other for fibre production . In North America , it is primarily the oilseed varieties which are produced commercially.Historians weave the magic of flax into ancient history . Records show that the human race has eaten this seed since early times.About 3,000 B.C . Flax is cultivated in Babylon.Burial chambers depict flax cultivation and clothing from flax fibres.About 650 B.C . Hippocrates writes about using flax for the relief of abdominal pains.In the same era , Theophrastus recommends the use of flax mucilage as a cough remedy.About 1st Century A.D. Tacitus praises the virtues of flax.About 8th Century A.D. Charlemagne considered flax so important for the health of his subjects that he passed laws and regulations requiring its consumption.About 15th Century A.D. Hildegard von Bingen used flax meal in hot compresses for the treatment of both external and internal ailments",0

"If you wanted to come out about an work relationship , how would you do it ? Would you tell everyone in the store were you worked at or just start with a few nice people ?

'' Or , if someone says , `` Hey , is there something going on between you and Roger ? '' say `` we 've been dating for six months , actually .

"Why does an apple is refered to a kid or learning ? I sometimes see an apple along with a student or a kid .

"what is the main ingredient in cocaine , where does it come from and what are the side efects of this drug ? it is extracted from the coca plant in south america , BUT there are so many other things that are in most batches of cocaine ( meaning cocaine is `` cut with '' other products ) such as analgesic drugs or even things like vitamin c or talcom powder , and most street coke is only around 40 % pure cocaine ... so its hard to say what the main ingredient is.the side effects depend on the frequency of use , how long you have been using , and how much you blow . an occaisonal user will probably experience little to no side effects , while a moderate user ( once or twice a week ) may begin to experince a `` drained '' feeling somewhere around 30-60 minutes after use , or a slight increase in irritability or other such things . a heavy user ( every day , multiple times a day ) will experience a pretty harsh come-down where one would feel exhausted , depressed , and like there is no point to doing anything because everything feels so BLAH and the only important or fun thing is drugs . they start to have mood swings , become irritated easily , paranoid , insomnia sets in which causes one to do more and more coke throughout the day to stay awake and live . it effects your life and your friends and at some point its hard to function in a normal day . pretty soon you NEED it , coke is all you think about . you think about when you can do it next , how much you have left , and where you can get it when you run out ... .i think that is probably all i can say at this point .",0

"How do you explain this ... . ? 50 % of all auto accidents are alcohol related , but only 40 % of those accidents are actually caused be the driver that was drinking . MADD claims that drunks could have prevented some of those accidents if their reaction time which was impaired by alcohol were eliminated . However if 60 % of all accidents that involve alcohol are caused by the sober person , if everyone quit drinking and driving if you go by the stats supplied by MADD , the amount of accidents would actually rise around 30 % . From a purely mathematical perspective , you 're right . But of course this would eliminate using the proper logic that the lack of alcohol intake makes for fewer impaired drivers that would be unable to effectively avoid an accident.Either way , do n't drink and drive ... you might spill your drink .",0

"Where , when , and why did the Holocaust happen ? Come on , if you are hoping for an easy answer to your homework , in several minutes you will have all the wikipedia links you could ever want on this subject . If you are hoping for non-attributable material in essay form , you wo n't get it here.Answers ... The Holocaust , meaning the Nazi German program to eradicate `` undesirable races '' like Jews , Gypsies and Slavs , happened primarily in what is now known as Poland and Germany , although one could argue that the round ups and other terror spread throughout most of occupied Europe.The rough period of the Holcaust varies depending on opinions . I rather believe it started with Kristalnacht on November 10 , 1938 and did n't end until 1945 with the final liberation . Survivors and their familes might tell you that they still suffer , therefore it has n't ended.Why is more complicated . I would read `` Hitler 's Willing Executioners '' by Daniel Goldhagen for a fairly succinct answer . However , it was the result of Nazi Germany 's effort to `` purify '' the `` Aryan '' ( what toff , as though they were Aryan ) race by killing off the so-called `` sub-humans '' .",0

"I can understand people not believing in God and Christianity or any other religion , but why insult it ? Why is it ok to curse , be mean to people , talk about and exploit sex , etc . in public and everywhere you go , but if you speak of God , Pray , or wear clothing with scriptures or anything like that you are offending people ? Even if you do n't believe in God and religion , look at the people who truly do believe and live their lives by the Word . Look at how they act . They are kind , caring , respectful and they donate money to charities and volunteer for things . So whether or not you think God is real , the people who do have become better people because of their belief . So in my mind 's eye , those who believe with their heart and confess with their mouth Jesus is indeeed our Saviour are 1 : If it 's all real then they are going to spend eternity with the Father 2 : Either way they are really good people.As for me I believe without a doubt but I struggle with living right . I have had a few experiences that made my belief stronger than ever . I still have to work on how I lead my life . Let 's face it -- it 's easier to insult or make fun of believers than to put that mantle on.You know what it 's like -- it 's not called `` the straight and narrow '' for nothing . I would n't say it 's true for all , but for many it 's just a case of not seeing any kind of benefit -- material , I 'm pretty sure -- to justify their committiment of time , let alone sacrifice.Why do you think so many people question God 's lack of intervention in natural disasters or tragic deaths ? These people all think it 's some kind of cause/effect relationship . You screw up -- God bails you out . If things go wrong , there ca n't be a God -- otherwise He 'd have stopped it.So many of these people are just jaded from the bombardment of so much content that they absorb -- TV , movies , the Internet . There 's plenty of crap to catch hold of , I have no doubt.They 're just so busy trying to disprove our beliefs they ca n't bother seeing the kinds of people they insult . As far as that goes , most of these folks see Christians as one big happy Pat Robertson family . Unfortunately , those that speak the loudest get the most attentio.I always figure every post from one of these folks is just another opportunity for me to witness . Maybe 99 times I 'll just be wasting my time . But who knows about the other 1 ? None of us are perfect , but you are certainly walking the right path . Let these lost souls both strengthen your faith and provide you a powerful incentive to keep witnessing God 's love and Jesus ' sacrifice for our sins . Go in peace and go with God.While I stand behind all the words I wrote above , I felt I had to add to this post in reaction to your additonal comments about prayer in school . I do n't know exactly what the context is , but I find it very troubling . As a Christian , I believe prayer to be the most direct link I have with God . But the notion that prayer should somehow be forced upon students or encouraged in a public school is not just unconstitutional but morally repugnant to me . Even voluntary prayer is patently coersive in my opinion . I think you are a well-meaning but misguided person who does need to work more on how you lead your life . A little bit more tolerance for those who do n't share your beliefs would be as welcome as others ' tolerance for yours .",0
"George Reeves ( Superman ) Murder or Suicide ? George Reeves - Actor 1914-1959 George Keefer Brewer was born in Woolstock , Iowa on January 5 , 1914 . Probably best known for his acting career in the hit Superman TV series during the 1950 's George was a well accomplished film and play actor as well . He starred in numerous leading and supporting roles in a variety of famous films dating back to 1939 including the blockbuster `` Gone with the Wind '' where he portrayed one of Scarlet 's suitors.George Reeves was 45 years old in 1959 when he was found dead in his home from a single gun shot . Many people speculate that he was murdered but his death was ruled a suicide predicated on the fact that he was in a deep depression state due to his inability to find acting work because he was typecast as superman . I personally do not believe that he took his own life , this man was strong willed , full of life and had everything to live for.The circumstances of his mysterious death and the investigation that followed left many unanswered questions and speculation . On the evening of his death , George was entertaining his girlfriend and a few friends in his lavish Hollywood home when he reportedly went upstairs by himself to his bedroom . After about a half hour the guests heard a single gun shot and found George lying dead on his back across the side of the bed with his feet still on the floor . George was killed instantly my a German Luger pistol bullet that went through his skull and lodged in the wall above his bed near the ceiling . The shell casing from the bullet was found after the police picked him up , he had been laying on it . It is still unknown as to how the casing got there and how George could of been lying on the shell casing if he would have taken his own life . No suicide note was found , and there was never the slightest indication from George that he might be in a depressed state . This is one of those mysteries that we may never find out the real truth .",0

"Why are celebs / other useless people paid so much ? Something I really do n't get.Why does someone that looks good ( in the right light and make up ) but does n't have two brain cells to rub together get paid millions for a movie deal ( even if they ca n't act ) ? Why do even dumber football stars get paid even more ? Double if they 've got a paternity suit or killed someone in the past ? Why also are teachers , nurses and other public servants that actually contribute to our quality of life paid so little ? My life is richer when I 'm not watching brainless celebs and sports stars on TV and I could live my life 100 % without any of them . I would not be living my happy comfortable life , however , if it was n't for teachers / nurses and other public servants.Someone help me understand why completely useless dreggs of society get paid so much . Please . A measure of the quality of life is not confined to the 'better ' things in life.Most people feel the need to relax , have fun and dream a little . Sometimes this is a reward for having done well , for others this may be an escape from not having everything they might wish.The argument for paying celebrities / sports stars huge amounts of money is fairly simple . Put those people on the screen / field and huge numbers will pay to watch , replace them with people with 98 % of their 'talents ' and hardly anyone will watch.A teacher or nurse touches the life of hundreds of people , celebs reach tens of millions . Another thing to remember is that having money through celebrity also has a burden . First , on a personal level public adoration is like an addiction , it is very difficult to deal with 'lows ' after the 'highs ' of performing . This is a major cause of the drug dependencies found in non-sports celebs - just look at rock stars.Secondly , 'people ' extract a price for their adoration . Celebrities become public property and have little or no private life unless they are very , very lucky.No celeb ( with any future ) will complain about stuff they need to do while in their public persona . Tom Cruise is a good example - will sign every autograph request at a premiere - he arrives hours early to do so . Julia Roberts explains that she makes movies because she loves it , the $ 25 million fees are for having to put up with the massive media and public intrusion.The intrusion into stars private lives is because of the insatiable appetite that the paying public has for coverage of their favorites.Only the very few very lucky or very litigious stars have a true private life.Finally , money is only function of how much people will pay - supply and demand.If the world only had a few thousand teachers , nurses ( I hesitate at public servants ; - ) ) perhaps they would be the superstars being paid the huge amounts of money ?",0

The result is that glucose is consumed , making two pyruvate molecules ( which in some systems can then enter the Citric Acid Cycle aka Kreb 's Cycle ) and ADP is turned into ATP , which is an energy source.And after memorizing this and subsequently forgeting all this useless detail some years ago , I nearly ralphed on my book reading this just now . Bad memories .",0

"Where can I find a cheap LCD Monitor ? There are a ton of specs for monitors , which ones are important and which ones just make it cost more ? I 'd like to scrap my big monitor if I can find a good one . The main thing with LCD monitors is response time . If you play games a low response time causes ghosting effects which makes the image appear blurred , one with a fast response time ( 16ms or better ) will not have this problem . You are in luck , the prices of LCD monitors have plummeted in the past few years and you can get a very good one from either Viewsonic or Samsung for around $ 200 for a 17 '' LCD monitor which has a resolution of 1280 x 1024 and 15 '' monitors have a resolution of 1024 x 768 . I would get a 17 '' . There are n't many other factors to consider besides maybe contrast ratio which is measured in ratios like 450:1 but tests have shown each manufacturer uses their own scale and some 450:1 monitors made by Samsung and Viewsonic are actually brighter and sharper than 600:1 monitors made by off-brand companies.At any rate , you ca n't go wrong with Viewsonic or Samsung and you just ca n't beat Newegg for selection or service.17 '' Viewsonics here , http : //www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp ?

"What are the different types of volcano ? How do they differ ? Please provide an example / location . Geologists classify volcanoes in following ways : Cinder cones are the simplest type of volcano . They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent . As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air , it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent to form a circular or oval cone . Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit and rarely rise more than a thousand feet or so above their surroundings . Cinder cones are numerous in western North America as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of the world.Some of the Earth 's grandest mountains are composite volcanoes -- sometimes called stratovolcanoes . They are typically steep-sided , symmetrical cones of large dimension built of alternating layers of lava flows , volcanic ash , cinders , blocks , and bombs and may rise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases . Some of the most conspicuous and beautiful mountains in the world are composite volcanoes , including Mount Fuji in Japan , Mount Cotopaxi in Ecuador , Mount Shasta in California , Mount Hood in Oregon , and Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier in Washington.Shield volcanoes , the third type of volcano , are built almost entirely of fluid lava flows . Flow after flow pours out in all directions from a central summit vent , or group of vents , building a broad , gently sloping cone of flat , domical shape , with a profile much like that of a warrior 's shield . They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of highly fluid lava flows called basalt lava that spread widely over great distances , and then cool as thin , gently dipping sheets . Lavas also commonly erupt from vents along fractures ( rift zones ) that develop on the flanks of the cone . Some of the largest volcanoes in the world are shield volcanoes . In northern California and Oregon , many shield volcanoes have diameters of 3 or 4 miles and heights of 1,500 to 2,000 feet . The Hawaiian Islands are composed of linear chains of these volcanoes including Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the island of Hawaii -- two of the world 's most active volcanoes.Volcanic or lava domes are formed by relatively small , bulbous masses of lava too viscous to flow any great distance ; consequently , on extrusion , the lava piles over and around its vent . A dome grows largely by expansion from within . As it grows its outer surface cools and hardens , then shatters , spilling loose fragments down its sides . Some domes form craggy knobs or spines over the volcanic vent , whereas others form short , steep-sided lava flows known as `` coulees . '' Volcanic domes commonly occur within the craters or on the flanks of large composite volcanoes . The nearly circular Novarupta Dome that formed during the 1912 eruption of Katmai Volcano , Alaska , measures 800 feet across and 200 feet high .",0

If you want to get that money ( selling your car ) , you need to work with the `` Fund Administrator '' , and sometimes your `` Human Resources/Supervisors '' to get that money . Sometimes , you 'll only get the money if you promise to pay it back . ( yep , mom & dad want you to be responsable ) 2 . IRA is like a standard car . You can select who administrates the account ( or where you park your car ) , what investment to buy ( what roads to drive on ) .

"What is the largest wave ever ridden by a surfer ? When , where and by whom ? I know Greg Noll had his pic taken on a wave 40+ feet high at Wiamea Bay .

Could that be the place ? ? I do n't know . If you have any pictures or can provide a website where I can find this info it would be appreciated . Thanks ! ! It depends on what you define as `` riding a wave '' . There are `` tow-in '' sufers who rely on `` jetskis '' to tow them into waves . These waves are so large and travel so fast that it is impossible for a human-propelled board to match its speed . The traditionalist of the sport do not consider that truly `` surfing the wave '' . There is a contest that awards , both the surfer and photographer a monetary award if they can produce a picture proving they rode the biggest wave . I do know in the past that a prize was awarded to a team capturing a picture at Todos Santos . Peahi aka Jaws , off of Maui is arguably the largest waves ridden .

"What are some symptoms to Manic Depression ? Bipolar Disorder ( Manic Depression ) Another type of depression is bipolar disorder , which was formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression . This condition shows a particular pattern of inheritance . Not nearly as common as the other types of depressive disorders , bipolar disorder involves cycles of depression and mania , or elation . Bipolar disorder is often a chronic , recurring condition . Sometimes , the mood switches are dramatic and rapid , but most often they are gradual.When in the depressed cycle , the person can experience any or all of the symptoms of a depressive disorder . When in the manic cycle , any or all of the symptoms listed under mania may be experienced . Mania often affects thinking , judgment , and social behavior in ways that cause serious problems and embarrassment . For example , unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is in a manic phase.A significant variant of bipolar disorder is designated as bipolar II . ( The usual form of bipolar disorder is referred to as bipolar I . ) Bipolar II is a syndrome in which the affected person has repeated depressive episodes punctuated by what is called hypomania ( mini-highs ) . These euphoric states in bipolar II do not fully meet the criteria for the complete manic episodes that occur in bipolar I. Depression Symptoms of Manic DepressionPersistently sad , anxious , or `` empty '' mood . Feelings of hopelessness , pessimism . Feelings of guilt , worthlessness , helplessness . Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed , including sex . Insomnia , early-morning awakening , or oversleeping .

It took ten years for my poor poor heart to mend after I divorced my husband of 13 years b/c he had a baby with an aquaitance of mine and I felt sorry for her not being married and all gave her a baby shower and gave her all my childs things ( i did not know it was his child til later ) . It just takes time . I dove into my work and made new friends ( seeing as how all my old friends knew it was his child and did not tell me ) and spent some quality time with myself . I got to know me really well and decided I really liked the new me . Just give yourself time to heal and get involved with work and friends . It does help .

"What is the right age to get married ? Age is n't as important as maturity and so many other factors , like life goals , and personality compatibility . We all are at some stage in life . A great marriage is one in which both parties are of pretty much equal places in maturity , experience , wisdom , ect . they want their lives to go the same place at the same speed , understand and happily accept the self sacrifice it takes to get there . Differences make for exciting mates and excitement in dating is a good thing but they make for an unhappy marriage in the long haul . In other words , who you prefer to date might be the exact opposite of who you should marry and as you mature , you 'll know the difference between the two.As it is , this is nothing but my opinion gleemed from life experience . I have no other qualifications to answer it and it should be taken as a persons opinion and nothing more .",0

You can also use stastitical methods to prove casality or other relationships .

"what is the best way to get money for college ? The first thing you need to know about money for college is that there are two kinds . Free and not free . In other words there are loans and scholarships . You want scholarships first and whatever is n't paid for by those can be covered with loans . To get scholarships some people think you have to be a `` straight A '' student or an exceptional athlete . Although those things do help , they are n't always necessary . You may have certain unique talents and abilities that can earn you scholarships regardless of your grades . Try visiting www.fastweb.com . You can use this site to make a profile and they will e-mail you scholarship opportunities that apply specifically to you ! Two kids from my high school won a scholarship for making their prom outfits out of duct tape ! True story ! Not all of the scholarships are that crazy but again , they do n't necessarily relate to grades or sports . If you do have good grades and/or play sports ; great ! Use that in your profile and they will send you opportunities that apply directly to your talents . It is totally free and there is no limit as to how many scholarships you can apply for and even win . So try to pay for everything you can with scholarships and then you may need to fill in some gaps with loans . Your next stop : www.fasfa.com . There you will apply for financial aid . You will need your most recent W-2 and your parents help when you apply . If you do n't have parents or you are over 24 years of age you get to skip the parent section . This site may reward you with some scholarships as well but it 's usually mostly government loans . That is why I would suggest applying for dozens of scholarships first . Good luck finding the money and good luck once you start school . Remember ; for every hour spent in class you should spend two hours studying !",0

"The Practice of Tithing : for today ? Is the practice of Tithing as described in the Old Testament Laws , and Malachi still to be practiced by Gentile Christians and/or Israeli Christians today , or has the new covenant practice of Giving cheerfully out of ones abundance and ability , as mentioned in II Corinthians replaced the old way ? Can a church today survive without a legalistic tenth of the congregations income , relying only on the abundant non percentage giving of those who are willing and able ? You are correct , it is unbiblical for a preacher to require members to tithe of income . Also tithing was always food never money and the tithe was always eaten by the tither . Read Deut . 12 and 14 . Can a church survive ? Yes but not as a mega church . the churches would be smaller and be more quality than quantity ( Jesus himself only had twelve apostles ) . Eliminate tithing and the pastor is forced to live by faith , not many of them want to do that though.Our church does not believe in tithing of income nor do I take an offering ( some do give anyway ) . When God decides it is time to close up then we will close up . All churches should run on faith not business tactics . The only thing most pastors have faith in is their ability to con their members out of more money.And in Malachi when it mentions will a man rob God ( preachers love that one ) no one mentions that this is written to the Levitical priests Mal 2:1 . It was the priests stealing the tithe from the tithers . It must be an honest mistake that they forgot this . lol . Malachi 3:8 ties in with I Samuel 2:12-17 . There were corrupt priests stealing then and there are corrupt preachers stealing now . I can hear the lake of fire calling for them now .

"Why Muslims do n't condemn the threats of Islamists to kill the danish cartoonists ? Iread today and i was upset that a Pakistani cleric promised bounty on the head of the cartoonist . like living in middle-ages or stone-ages where ppl got bounties on their head because of their opinion . of course there are more than one , but the cleric , as usual as many clerics , is ignorant probably took his information from somewhere : '' He said the mosque and his religious school would give $ 25,000 and a car , while a local jewelers ' association would give another $ 1 million . No representative of the association was available to confirm it had made the offer . `` This is a unanimous decision of by all imams ( prayer leaders ) of Islam that whoever insults the prophet deserves to be killed and whoever will take this insulting man to his end , will get this prize , '' Qureshi said . `` http : //news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060217/ap_on_re_mi_ea/prophet_drawingsWhy do n't you if you muslims do n't condemn such act openly ? if you are non-Muslim , how can we protect those innocent cartoonists ? To answer your original question , it is because Islam will NOT hold their fellow Muslims accountable for their actions.When asked of a Muslim , why doesn ’ t the Islamic majority in the United Nation condemn the thousands of terrorist acts perpetrated by those of your faith ? The answer comes back , “ We can not judge our Muslim brothers . Only Allah can judge them. ” Yet when it comes to judging the infidel , there are no holds barred . Now , let us contrast this attitude with what the Bible teaches.1 Corinthians 5:11-13For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside ? Do you not judge those who are inside ? But those who are outside God judges.This is the polar opposite to Islam . The Bible teaches that the Christian is to judge the actions of other Christians and call them on the carpet if they are doing ANYTHING unbiblical . However , those who are NOT believers , the Christian is to leave alone , that only GOD will judge them.So there is the contrast . If Islam was really concerned about peace , and was a peaceful religion , they would do something to stop these violent people . But do n't hold your breath .",0

"what 's the difference between sephardics and ashkenazies ? and their origin ? Askenazim are Jews whose ancestors migrated to Northern and Western Europe in the Middle Ages , especially to France and Germany . Due to expulsion from the former and persecution in the latter , they largely moved to Eastern Europe , especially Poland/Lithuania , which was an enormous and powerful country in Renaissance times . They spoke a German dialect that eventually evolved into the Yiddish language . Sephardim were decended from Jews who lived in the Iberian peninsula when it was ruled by the Moors . They were expelled from Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella and moved eastwrd to Greece , Turkey , the Balkans , and other lands . They spoke an archaic Spanish which later became Ladino . Lately , Asian Jews whose ancestry was never European and who had lived in places like Iran since the Roman Diaspora have also started being referred to as Sephardim .",0

"My friend is a marathon runner and he is getting cramps at mile 18 . What can he do ? He has run 4 marathons. ? Cramps are usually the result of mineral depletion . Others have advised about replenishing water and sodium , but overlook the importance of potassium , and , to a lesser extent , magnesium . While in training , he should have his potassium level checked to see if it is well within normal range ( 4.0 to 5.0 ) If not , he should ask his doctor about possible daily supplements . If it is normal , he should consider potassium loading before the race ( good foods include bananas , sweet potatoes , oranges ) and then supplementing during the race , either with pills ( preferably with a doctor 's OK ) , or , if his gastro system can handle it , orange juice or other high potassium fluids ; most sports drinks have only trace amounts of potassium . I 've run a few marathons and run at a relaxed pace , and thus it does n't bother my stomach to drink a quart of OJ an hour before the race and a pint at mile 14 ( supplied by a waiting family member ) , and this has helped reduce cramping a lot - I used to get severe charley horses at mile 19 . Tell your friend to search potassium loading on the web , there are a few references to it in marathon forums . The caveat is that a high potassium level is dangerous ; in people with normal kidney function , the kidney sloughs off any excess harmlessly ; but if renal function is impaired , high doses of potassium are contraindicated .",0
"sri lankan histore ? The Sinhalese arrived in Sri Lanka late in the 6th century B.C. , probably from northern India . Buddhism was introduced beginning in about the mid-third century B.C. , and a great civilization developed at the cities of Anuradhapura ( kingdom from circa 200 B.C . to circa A.D. 1000 ) and Polonnaruwa ( from about 1070 to 1200 ) . In the 14th century , a south Indian dynasty seized power in the north and established a Tamil kingdom . Occupied by the Portuguese in the 16th century and by the Dutch in the 17th century , the island was ceded to the British in 1796 , became a crown colony in 1802 , and was united under British rule by 1815 . As Ceylon , it became independent in 1948 ; its name was changed to Sri Lanka in 1972 . Tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil separatists erupted into war in 1983 . Tens of thousands have died in an ethnic conflict that continues to fester .

"i need to present a rememberence speech for a friend that died.. can u help ? I did that once , and it was so hard , but worth it . The best thing you can do is include an aspect from every group of people whose lives they affected . This paints a whole picture of the person and allows everyone to take part in the experience . But definitely pick those things which meant the most to you personally . It allows you to say those things you never got to say before . And whatever you say about them , pick many things that will bring smiles out of the people you are talking to , it eases the pain a little , and if you believe they are present after they pass , I 'm sure they do n't want everyone to suffer .",0
"do you have vonage ? and sbc/yahoo dsl ? I currently have sbc phone service/dsl , wondering if there is a way to get rid of my sbc phone service and get vonage ? Actually you ca n't have them both ( well technically you could , but it would be redundant ) . SBC ( now AT & T ) , as well as most other telcos , does not offer naked DSL . Meaning , you have to be an SBC landline phone service customer in order to have SBC DSL.If you want high speed internet access AND Vonage , then you 're going to have to get rid of SBC ( AT & T ) . You could keep the SBC/Yahoo ! DSL and still get Vonage , however , you 'd be paying for phone service twice.Try cable internet coupled with Vonage .",0

"What some things to say to a girl on the phone or how to start off a Conversation ? Im talkin bout a girl I just met ! got this in a daily emailAs far as starting conversations with women , here are a few ideas for you ... First of all , you must realize that your bodylanguage is more important than the words you use.Wherever you are , and whatever the situation , youMUST remember that your composure and bodylanguage are the keys . I 've watched a lot of guys approach a LOT ofwomen in my day . And I can usually tell within thefirst few SECONDS if the guy knows what he 's doingwith women ... and if he 's going to be successful . Most guys use submissive , apologetic bodylanguage and voice tones ... they almost look as ifthey 're pleading with a woman to give themapproval and that they 're nervous and selfconscious about the whole event . In other words , most guys come across asWUSSIES when they first approach women . On the other hand , the guys I know who are themost successful with women are the opposite . They 're totally cool , calm , and collected . Theyoften approach a woman and begin the conversationlike they would with an old friend . There is no apologetic body language , and thereare no signs of insecurity . They are n't there to find out if the woman isgoing to give them some approval ... on thecontrary , they are trying to find out if the womanmeets THEIR standards . Think about how you 'd act if you were onlyinterested in finding out if she 's the kind ofexceptional woman that you 're interested ingetting to know better , instead of being concernedabout whether or not she 's going to like you ... big shift , is n't it ? Now , here 's some homework for you : Sit down and think carefully about the mostcommon situations you find yourself in where yousee women that you 'd like to meet and talk to . Think about what 's going on in their minds , where they 're going , what they 've just done ... andwhat they 're about to do . Think about how they'reprobably feeling . Now , come up with 10 different ways that youcould start a conversation in this situation.Remember that YOU 'RE the one who is trying tofigure out if SHE is the kind of woman you 'd liketo get to know better . Once you 've come up with 10 good ones , pickyour favorite , and mentally rehearse it . I realize that I 'm asking you to do some workhere , but it 's sooooo worth it . I 'm going to give you one more hint ... Most of the guys I know who are great withwomen use the simplest of simple conversationstarters . `` Hi . '' `` What are you drinking ? '' `` Hi , are you from around here ? '' ... I realize that these sound simple , and theyare . But they 're so simple that they 're DISARMING.They do n't come across as canned `` pick up lines '' , and they help you figure out very quickly if thewoman you 're talking to is friendly . And remember , relaxed body language is Key ! the subject was how to apporach women",0

"Is big screen musicals are coming back today , or just a once in a lifetime ? I think right now , Americans are having a lacluster response to these movies .

Action movies are really popular , sci-fi really popular , musical movies are really popular , etc . I think in a couple of years musical movies will become big again . Until then , I think production companies will think hard about putting musicals up and into production .",0
"Can i use more than 1 anti-virus software in my PC ? How ? I want to install an anti-virus software ( panda ) , but i 'm told to uninstall my old program ( symantic ) .Can i install it without remove my old program ? I assume you 're using Windows . Using two anti-virus programs creates conflicts . For instance when you download a file both will try to scan it at the same time . The second program will cause an error because the file is already in use by the first program.One top of that Windows now requires each anti-virus program to register with it so it can monitor weather it 's enable or disabled . When there is two windows gets confused . Plus it uses up system resources . Just run on anti-virus application ; keep it updated , run regular scans . I often uninstall one and install a differnt one just to make sure mine is doing it 's job.I 've included a link on this topic .",0

"Does anyone really believe that there is intelligent life out there ? And do you believe they have visited the earth before ? If so how could they get here , it being so many light years to the nearest star that may have planets ? there is a pretty convincing argument based on statistics , but that depends largely upon the assumptions one makes . it is called the drake equation : Nc = N * fp * ne * fl * fi * fc * fLwhereN represents the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy fp is the fraction of stars that have planets around them ne is the number of planets per star that are capable of sustaining life fl is the fraction of planets in ne where life evolves fi is the fraction of fl where intelligent life evolves fc is the fraction of fi that communicate fL is fraction of the planet 's life during which the communicating civilizations liveandNc represents the number of communicating civilizationsi snagged this from this page : http : //www.activemind.com/Mysterious/Topics/SETI/drake_equation.htmlwhich explains what some reasonable estimates for these values are , and includes a little javascript calculator thingy so you can plug in your own values.if you use their estimates , the final result is that there should be around 1000 civilizations capable of communicating in the galaxy.however a lot of this hinges on the value of fl , which is the fraction of planets capable of supporting life where life actually evolves . since we have no evidence to support any value for this parameter at all , it 's all pretty moot.however , we have only just begun started exploring our own solar system , and there have been possible ( though not conclusive ) signs of life even the next planet over , on mars . only time will tell , i suppose .",0
